    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200059#WRA00600"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Probation Service is an agency of my Department working to reduce offending, create safer communities and fewer victims through offender rehabilitation informed by evidence-based practice.  It has a staff of about 400, located in over 35 community-based offices in every county and in every prison.  The Service's budget for 2019 is &euro;47.814m, an increase of &euro;1.569m since 2017.  I am informed that, on 1 March 2019, the Service's caseload comprised 10,174 offenders, of whom 8,670 were in the community and 1,504 were in custody.</p>  <p>  The primary function of the Service is to supervise offenders by order of the courts.  Offenders placed under supervision by the courts are assigned a Probation Officer who conducts a detailed assessment and works with the offender to address the underlying issues related to their offending. Supervision is done in a structured, evidence-based manner, built around a comprehensive case-management plan addressing the factors that have contributed to offending behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Probation Service also has responsibility for the supervision and management of community service orders, whereby convicted offenders are sentenced to between 40 and 240 hours unpaid work as an alternative to a custodial prison sentence.  I am advised by the Probation Service that, in all cases where the Court imposes a Community Service Order, its objective is to implement the Order as soon as possible. Some delay may occur on occasion, but I am informed that the Service proactively manages its resources to ensure it is responsive to the needs of the Court.  </p>  <p>  Following a recommendation of the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, the Probation Service developed an integrated model of community service which combines the unpaid work element of community service with a developmental/rehabilitative element aimed at addressing an offender&rsquo;s identified risks and needs in order to promote desistance from crime.  The Service commenced national roll out of this new model on a pilot basis in late 2017.  This new model remains under ongoing review by the Probation Service with formal evaluation scheduled for 2019.</p>  <p>  Voluntary supervision arises in a small number of cases where an offender consents to be supervised by the Probation Service.  Examples of voluntary supervision may include providing support in exceptional circumstances on a voluntary basis to an offender leaving custody who is deemed at high risk of reoffending and/or harm, but who has not been subject to a court order. The Service has also in the past at the request of other jurisdictions provided supervision of offenders on a voluntary/non-statutory basis.  The Service has limited scope for undertaking such voluntary supervision of offenders or former offenders, as its key role is to supervise offenders following a direction of the courts under the relevant legal provisions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200059#WRA00900"><p>Firstly I would like to reiterate for the House that with regard to the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas, the Deputy will appreciate that this is solely the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and his management team. </p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the distribution of Garda resources is constantly monitored and a distribution model is used that takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and overall policing needs at local level. It is then a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available, having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs. This applies equally in both rural and urban areas.</p><p>I would emphasise that is not appropriate to simply determine the allocation of Garda resources on the basis of population size alone, as it fails to take account of, among other things, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly in communities of similar population size.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the information requested by  the Deputy regarding the number of Garda&iacute; that have transferred out of the Divisions in question, is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of Garda resources to compile.  However, there is a general policy within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not to transfer a Garda from a Division without the provision of a replacement. I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda  who retired on a voluntary, compulsory or a cost neutral early retirement basis in the Cork Divisions during the years 2015- 2018 and up to 7 March, 2019 was 96.  I have provided for the record a detailed breakdown of this figure by Division as requested by the Deputy. </p><p>I am pleased to note, as advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cork Divisions as of 31 January the latest date for which figures are currently available was 1344, an increase of 10% since 31 Dec 2015. </p><p>When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, some<b></b>128 of whom have been assigned to the Cork Divisions.</p><p>I am further informed that it is the Commissioner&rsquo;s intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda civilian Staff. The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline duties for which they are trained. The injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. </p><p>The Commissioner has publicly spoken about issues like protecting our most vulnerable and he has highlighted that his priority is a policing model that will provide the best outcomes for communities.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commissioner has been provided with an additional &euro;100 million in 2019 bringing his total budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion.  This substantial investment will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue in tandem with the deployment of new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work of delivering a visible, effective and responsive police service to communities across all Garda Divisions, including the Cork  Divisions in 2019 and future years.</p><p><b>Retirements from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na 2015-2019 by Cork Division </b><table><tr><th></th><th>Cork City</th><th>Cork North </th><th>Cork West</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>17</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>53</td><td>22</td><td>21</td><td>96</td></tr></table>* includes retirements, on a voluntary, compulsory or a cost neutral early retirement basis </p></reply>

The most recent factbook, covering 2015, was published on the RSA&rsquo;s website in December 2018.</p>  <p>  This factbook shows that, in 2015, 106 public service vehicles and 915 goods vehicles were involved in fatal and/or injury collisions. The report also provides similar figures on drivers of such vehicles. In 2015, there were no fatalities of public service vehicle drivers, however, there were 17 injuries. For goods vehicle drivers, there were six fatalities and 317 injuries.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Road Safety Authority that their intent is to publish the 2016 Road Collision Factbook in the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  I do want to take the opportunity to address road safety more generally. In 2018, we witnessed the lowest number of road traffic fatalities on record (148), and while every single fatality on our roads is one too many, I was greatly encouraged by this downward trend. However, I am very concerned at the marked rise in road traffic fatalities in the year so far, particularly in view of the proactive efforts being made by the key stakeholder agencies to make our roads safer.</p>  <p>  Last week, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na publicly reiterated its continuing enforcement focus on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. It was shocking to read that 1 out of every 3 victims in fatal vehicle accidents had no safety belt on at the time of the collision, and, unfortunately, this trend seems to be continuing into 2019.</p>  <p>  This stark statistic underscores the need for drivers, and passengers, to ensure that all safety precautions have been taken, especially when it comes to seat belts. Finally, I would like to echo the comments made last week by the Chief Superintendent of the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau, when he said that "safety belts are proven life savers and must be worn every journey, every time".</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new Garda stations in Sligo, Clonmel and Macroom through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p></reply>

This allows findings and recommendations to be applied across the prison estate.  </p>  <p>  A general review of healthcare in the prisons is being progressed and is overseen by a Working Group involving officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. This arose from a report of the Inspector of Prisons entitled 'Healthcare in Irish Prisons' in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service works collaboratively with the HSE to provide effective care for the prison population.  However, the provision of appropriate mental health services to those in custody is a major challenge. </p>  <p>  Mental health services are provided to the Dublin and Portlaoise prisons by the Health Service Executive through the National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS). The HSE also provides psychiatric services for the Limerick, Cork and Castlerea prisons.  I am glad to say that the HSE has confirmed approval for the appointment of a consultant-led team in these prisons to provide forensic psychiatric in-reach services. The IPS are currently engaging with the HSE with a view to expediting these appointments. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has access to a limited number of places in the Central Mental Hospital for prisoners who require urgent residential treatment. I am informed that on average 25 prisoners can be awaiting transfer to the Central Mental Hospital.  This is of ongoing serious concern but it is anticipated that the opening of the new CMH in 2020 will help to improve capacity issues for prisoners in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment.</p>  <p>  I am informed that two dedicated areas have been established within the prisons for the provision of high support to vulnerable prisoners with mental illness; D2 wing in Cloverhill Prison (for remand prisoners), and the High Support Unit in Mountjoy (for sentenced prisoners).  Both units provide a dedicated area within the prison where mentally ill and vulnerable prisoners, who present with a risk of harm to self or to others are closely monitored in a safer environment. </p>  <p>  A psychiatric in-reach and Court Liaison Service is available at Cloverhill Prison. This diversion service ensures, as far as possible, that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system, are referred and treated appropriately.  This has resulted in approximately 130 prisoners being diverted to community services annually.</p>  <p>  The IPS Psychology Service, as part of the multidisciplinary team, plays a key role in the provision of mental health services for people in custody and is being expanded in order to better meet the mental health needs of prisoners.  </p>  <p>  The Service has also developed a bespoke mental health training programme, which is currently being delivered to all staff.  Since September 2016, over 1,500 staff have been trained and the programme continues to be rolled out to remaining staff.  In addition, all persons in custody have access to the Samaritans Listeners Scheme. </p>  <p>  As can be seen, the Prison Service takes this issue seriously and has a range of measures in place designed to prevent, in so far as possible, deaths in custody.  However, given the number of vulnerable prisoners in custody, it remains a matter of significant concern to me and I have raised it with the Director General who assures me that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure the full and timely implementation of recommendations made by the Inspector of Prisons into deaths in custody. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Director General that the matter of monitoring of prisoners on special observation, which is a concern that the Inspector of Prisons has raised in successive reports, is being addressed through the implementation of a range of new policies and procedures. The roll out of the new measures will be supported by a communication strategy to ensure the full awareness of staff of their obligations in this regard and the disciplinary sanctions which will apply where the appropriate policies and procedures are not properly adhered to.</p></reply>

As of the same date, the total Garda strength was approximately 14,000. In this regard civilian staff now account for approximately 15% of the overall Garda workforce. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's vision is for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members and 4,000 Garda Staff.  The projected 4,000 Garda Staff represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect, with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians, where necessary. </p>  <p>  Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation. Since the beginning of 2017 approximately 350 new civilian posts have been sanctioned by the Policing Authority with the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The bulk of these were to address critical skills gaps and capacity issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 31 December 2018, approximately 260 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed to operational policing duties.  I further welcome the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019. The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to visible frontline policing duties in 2019.  </p>  <p>  This approach to continued and increased recruitment of civilian personnel is very much in line with the Report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland.  This Report was approved by Government in December.  Civilianisation and redeployment are among the key projects  being progressed in 2019 in the Implementation Plan published by Government in December - &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo; - and I am confident the full realisation of these projects will deliver a better policing service to the public. </p></reply>

The Commissioner has publicly spoken about issues like protecting our most vulnerable and he has highlighted that his priority is a policing model that will provide the best outcomes for communities. </p><p>The distribution of Garda resources is constantly monitored and a distribution model is used that takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and overall policing needs at local level. Is is then a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs. This applies equally in both rural and urban areas.</p><p>I would emphasise that it is not appropriate to simply determine the allocation of Garda resources on the basis of any single metric, such as population, as that would fail to take account of, among other things, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly in communities of similar population size.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 January 2019, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Donegal Division was 409. There are also 13 Garda Reserves and 38 Civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I was pleased to attend the attestation ceremony last Friday where over 200 probationer Garda&iacute; attested, of whom 15 members will be allocated to the Donegal Division. </p><p>I am further informed that it is the Commissioner's intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 along with a net 600 Garda staff. The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the frontline duties for which they are trained. The injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. </p><p>Furthermore, the Commissioner has been provided with an additional &euro;100 million in 2019 bringing his total budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion. This substantial investment will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue in tandem with the deployment of new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work of delivering a visible, effective and responsive police service to communities across all Garda Divisions, including the Donegal Division in 2019 and future years. </p><p>The following table sets out the strength of the Donegal Division from 2009 to 31 January 2019, the latest date for which figures are currently available. </p><p>Strength of the Donegal Division 2009 to 2019*<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>468</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>466</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>444</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>427</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>409</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>397</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>392</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>382</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>386</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>404</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>409</td></tr></table>*As of 31 January 2019</p></reply>

I know the Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation can deal with any policing challenges arising from Brexit though clearly the circumstances which may arise are dependant on the political settlement.  </p>  <p>  The Government's policy is that there will be no hard border on the island and there are no plans for such.  However, policing in the border region has always presented particular challenges and this can be expected to increase in the context of Brexit.  It is also the case that violent dissident republic groups continue to seek to frustrate counter-terrorism efforts and organised criminals seek to exploit the two jurisdictions in order to try to evade detection.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 Cross-Border Threat Assessment prepared jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI estimated that some 43 per cent of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-border dimension. Likewise, mobile organised crime groups, responsible for multiple instances of domestic burglary, operate on an all-island basis.  There are increasing instances of borderless crimes such as cyber fraud and international terrorism.  </p>  <p>  The success of cross border policing actions is grounded in the recognition that the best means of combatting the threat to our communities is to maintain and enhance the excellent levels of cooperation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the border. The Garda&iacute; and PSNI, along with other agencies, have worked together closely for many years and enjoy an excellent working relationship and co-operation at all levels.</p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement recognised this and led to the establishment of Joint Agency Investigation Teams which have had considerable success in combatting this type of crime.  I understand this is also the context for the Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit in Cavan.  </p>  <p>  Garda ASUs provide a rapid armed response capacity and capability on a Regional basis. Members of the ASUs are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective Regions. In the Northern Region ASUs are currently based in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth.</p>  <p>  Garda deployments in all areas of the country including those along the Border have benefitted from increased recruitment in recent years.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Northern Region as on 31 January, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 1,406 Garda&iacute;. There are 59 Garda Reserves and 144 Garda civilian staff attached to the Northern Region.  An additional 49 Garda&iacute; were assigned to the region with effect from last Friday.  </p>  <p>  The increased resources coming on stream have also provided the capacity to expand the specialist bureaus including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, all of which are particularly active in the Northern Region in addition to the Armed Support Units.</p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service.  These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management with a view to addressing any policing requirements for the Border region which may arise depending upon the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can and will be provided through redeployment. </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide the necessary resources to keep our people and our communities safe.</p></reply>

I know the Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation can deal with any policing challenges arising from Brexit though clearly the circumstances which may arise are dependant on the political settlement.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is well aware, the Government's policy is that there will be no hard border on the island and there are no plans for such.  However, as he is also aware, policing in the border region has always presented particular challenges and this can be expected to increase in the context of Brexit.  It is also the case that violent dissident republic groups continue to seek to frustrate counter-terrorism efforts and organised criminals seek to exploit the two jurisdictions in order to try to evade detection.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 Cross-Border Threat Assessment prepared jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI estimated that some 43 per cent of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-border dimension. Likewise, mobile organised crime groups, responsible for multiple instances of domestic burglary, operate on an all-island basis.  There are increasing instances of borderless crimes such as cyber fraud and international terrorism.  </p>  <p>  The success of cross border policing actions is grounded in the recognition that the best means of combatting the threat to our communities is to maintain and enhance the excellent levels of cooperation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the border. The Garda&iacute; and PSNI, along with other agencies, have worked together closely for many years and enjoy an excellent working relationship and co-operation at all levels.</p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement recognised this and led to the establishment of Joint Agency Investigation Teams which have had considerable success in combatting this type of crime.  I understand this is also the context for the Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit in Cavan.  </p>  <p>  Garda ASUs provide a rapid armed response capacity and capability on a Regional basis. Members of the ASUs are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective Regions. In the Northern Region ASUs are currently based in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth.</p>  <p>  Garda deployments in all areas of the country including those along the Border have benefitted from increased recruitment in recent years.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Northern Region as on 31 January, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 1,406 Garda&iacute;. There are 59 Garda Reserves and 144 Garda civilian staff attached to the Northern Region.  An additional 49 Garda&iacute; were assigned to the region with effect from last Friday.  </p>  <p>  The increased resources coming on stream have also provided the capacity to expand the specialist bureaus including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, all of which are particularly active in the Northern Region in addition to the Armed Support Units.</p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service.  These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management with a view to addressing any policing requirements for the Border region which may arise depending upon the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can and will be provided through redeployment. </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide the necessary resources to keep our people and our communities safe.</p></reply>

The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It is intended that the legislation will abolish the court poor box and replace it with a statutory Reparation Fund to provide for a fair, equitable and transparent system of reparation that will apply only to minor offences dealt with by the District Court. The new Reparation Fund will be used to provide additional funding for services for victims of crime and compensation payments payable by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. The legislation will clearly provide that the Reparation Fund may not be used for any purpose other than the provision of compensation, reparation and assistance for victims of crime.  </p>  <p>  The replacement of the court poor box by a statutory Reparation Fund was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its 2005 report The Court Poor Box: Probation of Offenders. </p>  <p>  The court poor box will continue to operate while the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill is being prepared. Once the Bill has passed through the Houses it is envisioned that the court poor box system will be replaced with the Reparation Fund I have described.</p></reply>

Garda&iacute; in Cork are determined to act against all forms of criminal activity and will work with communities to prevent and detect crime. </p>  <p>  Togher and Anglesea Street Districts form part of the Cork City Division and as of 31 January 2019 there were 703 Garda members assigned to Cork City Division. There are also 38 Garda Reserves and 80 Garda staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  I understand that the crime statistics for Q4 of 2018, which will include the Christmas period, will be published by the CSO in the coming weeks.  These will be scrutinised by my Department, and other stakeholders upon publication.

These measures include utilising, to the greatest extent possible, advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. </p>  <p>  The tackling of organised criminality is achieved through the use of focused intelligence-led operations by Garda specialist units, including the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Economic Crime Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations. When required, support from the Security and Intelligence Section is also available. These specialist units also work closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau in targeting criminality.  </p>  <p>  Multi-disciplinary approaches are used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted. Such approaches also include the use of money-laundering legislation and the powers available to the Criminal Assets Bureau under the proceeds of crime legislation.</p>  <p>  Garda operational responses to gang-related crime in Dublin are coordinated under Operation Hybrid. As of 13 January 2019, there have been 86 arrests in relation to gang-related killings and 3 persons convicted of murder with life sentences imposed. In addition, 290 searches have been undertaken, 37 firearms have been seized and over 17,000 lines of enquiry conducted. In excess of 73,000 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact. </p>  <p>  A number of arrests were made in the UK recently on foot of investigations, supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, into the supply of drugs and firearms in Ireland and the UK. There were also a number of significant drug seizures made by An Garda Siochana in recent weeks.  </p>  <p>  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the international frameworks for cooperation in criminal matters are being utilised.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also maintains close liaison with a range of other law enforcement agencies internationally and the work of Garda liaison officers who are permanently based in other jurisdictions and in international bodies such as Interpol and Europol, greatly facilitate the prompt exchange of information and intelligence on criminal activity.  </p>  <p>  The manner in which the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are deployed, including personnel, is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no direct role in this regard. However, I am informed by the Commissioner that the additional resources coming on stream have enabled him to assign extra resources to the specialist units, including the Armed Support Unit, Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 2,400 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 800 new Garda during 2018. </p>  <p>  A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. This includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; and 600 Garda Civilian Staff in 2019. The recruitment of the additional civilian staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; in 2019 from administrative duties to the frontline policing duties for which they were trained. </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that the Government's commitment to increase the overall strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 Garda members will be achieved by the target date of 2021. </p></reply>

However there is evidence available internationally that children in care are much more likely to be cautioned or convicted of a criminal offence. It is undoubtedly the case that many offenders have experienced significant disadvantage and trauma.  I am informed that a number of services are in place to seek to address these needs while the person is in custody.  </p>  <p>  For example, I am advised that the IPS Psychology Service provides a number of interventions, both in a group and on an individual basis, which support individuals who have had adverse childhood experiences, including having been placed in care.  These include a Comprehensive Resource Model group programme which is a trauma-specific, recovery-based therapy. It also involves other therapies which address cognitive, affective and behavioural instability that often results from adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). These include Mentalisation therapy, Dialectical Behaviour therapy, Cognitive Behaviour therapy and Schema therapy.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Irish Prison Service that during the course of clinical and therapeutic interventions with individual prisoners, their personal background, including any experiences in the care of the State, may be discussed as part of that engagement with a professional service. However, any personal history information is only recorded as part of confidential case notes and is not currently collated for any statistical purposes.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department&rsquo;s Data and Research Strategy 2018-2020 was launched in July 2018. This Strategy aims to facilitate better collaboration and information sharing between the Department and its agencies and stakeholders in order to ensure better provision of data, information, analysis, evaluation and research.  A Research Advisory Group, including external experts, has put in place a clear process for prioritising research projects for funding and a plan including internal and external research collaborations is currently being progressed.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in that matter.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems at key locations along the road network and in urban centres. This commitment is being progressed in a number of ways, including in particular through the community CCTV grant-aid scheme administered by my Department.</p><p>I would recall that CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access fall into two distinct but complementary categories, namely Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems. Neither may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner, among other requirements. </p><p>Garda CCTV systems are established and maintained in areas or at locations decided upon by the Garda authorities.</p><p>Community based CCTV schemes are governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee, </p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and </p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller. </p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  </p><p>A grant aid scheme is being administered by my Department to support local communities meeting the statutory requirements for community based CCTV and who wish to install systems in their localities, including access roads to their localities where necessary and appropriate.  Eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address I encourage any interested groups to make contact with my officials for further assistance. </p><p>More generally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government also recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis. </p><p>In support of this commitment, &euro;342 million is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to utilise appropriate technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community.  A significant capital investment is also being made in the Garda fleet, amounting to &euro;46 million between 2016 and 2021, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p><p>For example and as the Deputy may be aware, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology is fitted in a number of official Garda vehicles which are allocated around the country and used on a daily basis to assist in the prevention and detection of crime, particularly on our roads network.</p><p>The 2019 capital allocation for Garda ICT amounts to more than &euro;61million and the allocation to the Garda fleet this year is a total of &euro;10 million. The distribution of these resources, including the ICT projects and programmes to be prioritised and the allocation of Garda vehicles across the Divisions throughout 2019 are a matter for the Garda authorities. </p></reply>

The Standards will meet those set out in the Recast Reception Conditions Directive and under EASO Guidance on Reception Conditions.  Operational standards and indicators will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.</p>  <p>  In order to meet needs in the longer term, and improve the quality of the accommodation , the Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to persons in the protection process, by way of the independent living model, will be advertised. This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and is due for completion in 2020. This will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire State. Under this competition, all successful bids must provide residents with the option of preparing their own meals as part of their proposal.</p></reply>

North Division and the D.M.R. West Division on 31 January 2019 the latest date for which figures are readily available was 714 and 707 respectively. There are also 40 Garda Reserves and 53 Garda civilian staff attached to the D.M.R. North Division and there are 26 Garda Reserves and 62 Garda civilian staff attached to the D.M.R. West Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 200 trainees who passed out from the college just last week. </p>  <p>  The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p>  <p>  I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the D.M.R. North Division and the D.M.R. West Division.</p>  <p>  The Garda strength of the D.M.R. North Division and the D.M.R.

I want to assure the Deputy that Ireland&rsquo;s laws are fully in line with the Convention. This was largely achieved by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which was a ground-breaking piece of legislation.  It brought in a new offence of accessing child pornography online.  It also criminalised grooming behaviour, such as communicating with a child online for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Even prior to this Act, our legislation on child pornography included images of a person generated or modified by computer-graphics.  This legislation ensures the State&rsquo;s compliance with criminal law provisions in the Lanzarote Convention.</p>  <p>  In relation to other elements of the Convention, my Department has carried out a detailed review of compliance, in consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other relevant stakeholders, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Health Service Executive.  Information was sought regarding the child protection, prevention and victim support aspects of the Convention. This concerns the operational, rather than legislative aspects of the Convention.  While the Department now has most of the information required for ratification, some stakeholder work is still required to ensure that Ireland is fully compliant in all areas of the Convention.  Once that work has been completed, and the Office of the Attorney General has been consulted, steps towards formal ratification can be taken.</p></reply>

Although a border poll would not be regarded as a risk, and the very important and sensitive policy issues related to it would not be dealt with in the Risk Assessment process, the question of relationships on the island of Ireland, and between the two islands, are always considered as part of the annual National Risk Assessment. The National Risk Assessment was one of the first official acknowledgements of the risks posed by a potential Brexit including associated risks for Northern Ireland.</p><p>Since the National Risk Assessment was first introduced, these issues have featured prominently, and been supported by accompanying text, in the published annual Report as follows:<table><tr><th>National Risk Assessment </th><th>Relevant Risk:</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>Geopolitical: &lsquo;Uncertainty over UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU and enhanced devolution within the UK&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Terrorist incidents and Armed Conflict&rsquo;</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>Geopolitical: &lsquo;Uncertainty over UK&rsquo;s relationship with EU&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Devolution and related political developments in the UK&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Terrorist incidents and Armed Conflict&rsquo;</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>Overview: &lsquo;Possible Effects of Brexit&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Brexit/Uncertainty over UK&rsquo;s relationship with EU&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Northern Ireland and Devolution in the UK&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Terrorist Incidents and Armed Conflicts&rsquo;<br /><br />Economic Risks: &lsquo;Trading Relations with the UK&rsquo;</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Geopolitical: &lsquo;Departure of the UK from the EU&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Instability in Northern Ireland and changes to constitutional makeup of the UK&rsquo;<br /><br />Economic Risk: &lsquo;Impact of Brexit on vulnerable sectors of economy&rsquo;<br /><br />Social Risk: &lsquo;Migration and integration&rsquo;</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>Geopolitical: &lsquo;Departure of the UK from the EU&rsquo;<br /><br />Geopolitical: &lsquo;Instability in Northern Ireland&rsquo;<br /><br />Economic Risk: &lsquo;Impact of Brexit on vulnerable sectors of economy&rsquo;<br /><br />Social Risk: &lsquo;Migration and integration&rsquo;</td></tr></table></p><p>Work has now commenced on the 2019 Report, but is at an early stage. There will be extensive consultation and stakeholder engagement throughout its development, with the Draft Report published for a 4 week public consultation period in April, and an Open Policy Forum will also be held in May. A significant volume and range of risks, including in relation to Northern Ireland, will therefore be discussed and considered over the coming months, before the final National Risk Assessment Report for 2019 is published by July.</p></reply>

L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n (P51) was commissioned in 1999, with L&Eacute; Niamh (P52) commissioned in 2001.  </p>  <p>  Along with the rest of the Naval Service fleet, both of these vessels undertake a variety of functions in the maritime domain in accordance with the role assigned to the Naval Service by Government. This encompasses the provision of support to other Government Departments and Agencies such the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  All Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and search and rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol.  These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland's maritime jurisdiction.  In addition to performing assigned tasks in Irish waters, both L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh have been deployed to the Mediterranean in recent years as part of Operations Pontus and Sophia. </p>  <p>  The service life of an Irish Naval Service ship is determined by the level of operational activity, but usually is around 30 years.  It is, however, normal practice in a ship&rsquo;s life to carry out a mid-life refurbishment / extension programme so as to extend the useful life of a ship to thirty (or more) years. </p>  <p>  The P50 class vessels, 20 and 18 years old this year, now fall into the category of ship requiring a mid-life refurbishment / extension programme.  Due to their age profile, much of the auxiliary equipment onboard is coming to the end of its useful life or is becoming obsolete and requires to be replaced in a structured manner.   </p>  <p>  In this regard the Naval Service have, along with my Department,  been planning for a Mid-Life Extension Programme for this class of vessels.  This planned programme of works will ensure that both vessels will maintain their operational capabilities and reliabilities.  Works are due to commence this month on L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n.</p></reply>

In general, the minimum service required by a non-commissioned officer or private of the PDF who enlisted prior to 1 April 2004, to qualify for a pension is 21 years, or 12 years if discharged on medical grounds.  I am advised that the individual in this case was discharged from the Defence Forces in 1994, at his own request, after 13 years&rsquo; service.  As he had less than the required minimum service, he was not eligible for a pension under the rules of the Schemes.  He was however paid a 'short service' gratuity, in accordance with the relevant rules.</p>  <p>  Service in the FCA (Reserve Defence Force) prior to 1974 is not reckonable for pension purposes. After 1974 there is provision for service on full-time security duties in the FCA to be reckoned for pension purposes, subject to fulfilling certain conditions. </p>  <p>  In relation to the request to amalgamate service in the PDF with service in the Department of Justice and Equality the position is that there is a Public Sector Transfer Network of which both this Department and the Department of Justice and Equality are members.  This Network allows for the transfer of service for pension purposes, subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  My Department has been in contact with the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the case of the individual referred to.  Unfortunately, based on the preliminary information obtained to date, it would appear that this case does not satisfy the required conditions.  My Department is however examining all matters, including the possibility of full time service in the FCA, in more detail and will be writing to the individual concerned in the near future to set out the position. </p></reply>

As part of these efforts, the Government has organised &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; public information events around Ireland to inform and advise about Brexit preparedness and the range of support measures and resources that the Government has put in place.</p><p>These events brought together over a dozen Agencies and their parent Departments &ndash; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - under one roof to inform and advise both citizens and businesses.</p><p>The events also attracted significant domestic and international (in particular UK) media coverage which afforded an opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach and specific concerns in relation to Brexit. </p><p>The Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in question took place in Cork on 5 October, Galway on 12 October, Monaghan on 19 October, Dublin on 25 October, Limerick on 23 November and Letterkenny on 30 November. Having participated at each event, I am pleased to confirm that they attracted very strong participation by a combined total of approximately 2,500 attendees.</p><p>The positive impact of the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events and the Government's ongoing public information activities in relation to Brexit preparedness is reflected in an increase in the uptake of the many Brexit Business supports that are offered by State Agencies. For example, over 4,000 companies have availed of the Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard facility as a first step in developing their Brexit plan. Similarly, over 1,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service so far in 2019; this is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018.</p><p>Other Brexit preparedness-related public information activities and events continue to be organised by Government Departments and State Agencies across Ireland. Since September 2018 there have been over 80 such events across 20 counties. Relevant details on these activities and events and on Brexit preparedness more generally can be found via the gov.ie/brexit website.</p><p>To coincide with the &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; events held to date, there was also a sustained public information campaign which ran on radio, in print media, online and via social media channels.  This campaign ensured that citizens and businesses were informed of the measures available to them.</p><p>In organising each event, every effort was made to ensure that costs were kept to the necessary minimum and that they achieved the best value for money. Costs that have arisen directly in connection with the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events held so far and costs for the accompanying public information campaign activities for which invoices/confirmed costings have been received are as follows: <table><tr><th>Item </th><th>Totals </th></tr><tr><td>Venue Hire, Catering &amp;amp; Related</td><td>&euro;69,242.84 </td></tr><tr><td>Event Staging / Audio-Visual Equipment (OPW)</td><td>&euro;101,595.73 </td></tr><tr><td>Event Materials / Signage / Badging</td><td>&euro;22,964.30 </td></tr><tr><td>Photography / Video / Podcast</td><td>&euro;17,252.85 </td></tr><tr><td>Advertising &amp;amp; Design </td><td>&euro;294,859.18 </td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>&euro;2,086.47 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;508,001.37 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Government has made this position consistently clear to the British Government, and will continue to do so.</p><p>I met with the UK Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington MP, in Dublin on 28 February and, as part of our discussions, I raised the UK Supreme Court judgment the previous day and the Government's position that an independent public inquiry is required in the Finucane case. I also raised the matter in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP in London on 6 March. The Government's position will also be reaffirmed to the British Government in writing, taking account of the UK Supreme Court judgment and declaration in the Finucane case.</p><p>The case of Pat Finucane is being discussed today by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg, under the McKerr group<i></i>of cases which concern the effectiveness of investigations into Troubles-related deaths in Northern Ireland and the UK's obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights. The Irish national statement will reaffirm the Government's support for a re-opening of supervision by the Committee of Ministers in the Finucane case in accordance with the request of the applicant, Geraldine Finucane. The Irish statement will also re-affirm the Government's position that a public inquiry into the case should be established, consistent with the commitment made in this respect by the British Government under the Weston Park Agreement of 2001.</p><p>My thoughts are with Geraldine Finucane and her family who have had to campaign unceasingly over the last 30 years, simply seeking to establish the full facts behind the loss of their loved one. The efforts of the Finucane family, pursued with courage, dignity and resilience, are replicated in different ways by many other families across all sections of the community, North and South, East and West, who continue to seek truth and justice following the loss of their loved ones in the dark years of the Troubles.</p><p>The legacy of the past still needs to be fully addressed, and this must be done in a way that meets commitments made to all victims and survivors, including by implementing the Stormont House Agreement and by honouring the commitments made at Weston Park nearly 18 years ago.</p><p>The Government will continue to engage with the British Government to seek progress with outstanding commitments and issues, to comprehensively address the legacy of the past and meet the needs and expectations of victims and survivors.</p></reply>

A new roster was set up in January further to a Call for Volunteers which issued in July 2018. </p>  <p>  Members of the roster are expected to be of good character. Prior to their circulation regarding election observation missions, those who have been shortlisted for roster membership are subject to security vetting in conjunction with the National Vetting Bureau. That vetting process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Roster members who participate in election observation missions are expected to behave professionally and impartially and to demonstrate sound judgement. Members of the roster are volunteers; the restrictions placed on civil servants in relation to political activity do not apply to volunteer roster members (unless of course the individual concerned also happens to be a civil servant). It is to be expected, and indeed welcomed, that a roster formed in a plural society would contain a broad range of opinion, consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations on freedom of expression.</p></reply>

Ireland subsequently supported moves at the United Nations Human Rights Council to establish an independent Commission of Inquiry into the events. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has now published its Report.</p>  <p>  The Commission has clearly carried out its task in a careful and professional manner, and I commend them for their work. It is regrettable that the Israeli authorities decided not to cooperate with the Commission in any way, including refusing allowing the Commission members to enter Gaza.  All Governments should cooperate with relevant HRC processes.</p>  <p>  Their Report makes for sombre and deeply disturbing reading. While there is clearly a dispute over the events in Gaza last summer, leading to some element of genuine uncertainty about some specific events, I believe the Commission Report provides a reasonably authoritative account and analysis of what happened. Over a prolonged period of some months of demonstrations near the border fence, Israeli army sharpshooters shot over 6,000 people, killing 183 of them. While the majority were shot in the legs, suggesting some attempt to use non-lethal force, many suffered life-changing injuries, including loss of limbs. Some persons were shot close to or at the border fence, but many were some hundreds of metres inside Gaza, and some were up to a kilometre from the fence. Victims included women, children, and identifiable medical workers and journalists.</p>  <p>  The Report suggests that Israeli authorities had reason to be concerned at a possible mass incursion into Israel, and to prepare for it, but also that this did not occur. Only a small fraction of the demonstrators were engaged in any such action. Very many of those shot were demonstrably not posing any serious threat when they were shot.</p>  <p>  The Report instances some cases of violence on the part of some demonstrators, mostly stone throwing and the floating of incendiary devices into Israel, where they started fires in crops and property. </p>  <p>  The Report concludes that, in relation to the use of force by Israeli forces under various headings, in at least some cases there are grounds to consider that war crimes may have been committed, in that the use of lethal force was not justified under international law. This would be a question for a court to decide.</p>  <p>  The Commission Report therefore confirms the view I expressed in the D&aacute;il on behalf of the Government last summer. I noted that international law allows the use of potentially lethal force by security forces only as a last resort, and when faced with immediate and serious threat. I said it was clear that these limits had not been respected, and that the actions of some demonstrators in no way justified such a violent response. I summed up that "Israel is entitled to defend itself, but it is not entitled to do this." It is no satisfaction to me that the Commission Report now backs up that view.</p>  <p>  The Report will now be considered by the UN Human Rights Council.  </p></reply>

This decision is a result of legislation adopted by the Knesset last year that instructs the Government to withhold money equivalent to what the Palestinian Authority pays to Palestinians convicted by Israeli courts of involvement in terrorism or other security-related offences, and to their families.</p>  <p>  I also understand that the Palestinian leadership has in response decided to reject all clearance revenue in protest at the funding cut, which no doubt will have repercussions for the Palestinian people who depend on the PA to deliver basic services such as healthcare and access to education.</p>  <p>  I am acutely concerned about the worsening financial situation of the PA. Thankfully the impact of its budget shortfall last year was somewhat mitigated by donor aid. This economic insecurity is expected to increase this year, and as we have seen in 2018, the same scale of financial aid by large donors is by no means guaranteed. The financial stability of the PA is inextricably linked to the security of both the Palestinians and the Israelis. I believe that the EU is right to urge the Palestinian Authority to review how it operates its system of payments. However, as I have said before in this House and elsewhere, unilateral moves, such as withholding a huge proportion of the revenue collected on the Palestinian Authority's behalf, seriously undermine the chances for a just and lasting peace. </p>  <p>  These are very serious developments that put at risk the financial stability of the Palestinian Authority and ultimately the security of both Israelis and Palestinians alike. EU Heads of Mission in Ramallah, including the Irish representative to the Palestinian Authority, met with senior figures from the Palestinian Authority to discuss this decision.  </p>  <p>  I reiterate the EU&rsquo;s call for Israel to honour its obligations under the Oslo Accords, with due regard to the Paris Economic Protocol, which administers the economic and financial relations between Israel and the PA. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that these concerns about the repercussions of this move on the peace process will be raised with Israeli interlocutors.</p></reply>

The Plan is a whole of Government initiative which has been developed with the support and cooperation of a number of Government Departments and State Agencies.  Its aim is to promote responsible business practices at home and overseas by all Irish business enterprises in line with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights globally. The Plan is directed at Government and State agencies, Irish companies operating at home and overseas, and multinational enterprises operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department has established the Business and Human Rights Implementation Group to oversee implementation of the National Plan over the next three years. Its membership consists of representatives from civil society, the business community, Government and an independent Chairperson. The first meeting of the Implementation Group took place on 16 January 2019 and it is being tasked with taking forward delivery of key action points under each of the three pillars of the UN Guiding Principles, i.e. the State duty to protect, corporate responsibility to respect and access to remedy. The next meeting of the Group is due to take place in April. </p>  <p>  To aid the work of the Implementation Group, my Department commissioned a baseline assessment of the current legislative and regulatory framework for business and human rights in Ireland from an independent consultant. This assessment identifies key issues for Ireland in a number of areas including worker&rsquo;s rights, anti-corruption, equality, anti-trafficking, data protection, environment, non-financial reporting, procurement and supply chain. It also assess Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments in the area of business and human rights. The report makes a number of recommendations which may help guide the work of the Group when implementing the National Plan on Business and Human Rights. The baseline assessment is currently being finalised and will shortly be uploaded to my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Ireland consistently advocates for the right of civil society actors and human rights defenders to operate in a free and safe environment without fear of reprisal. Ireland played a key role in the drafting of EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, adopted during our EU Presidency in 2004. Ireland is also a co-sponsor of the annual Human Rights Defenders resolution at the UN Human Rights Council and continues to use the Universal Periodic Review process as an opportunity to make recommendations to states on the matter. </p>  <p>  Ireland is open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding Treaty, which we believe should treat all economic operators in a non-discriminatory manner and should therefore cover companies engaged in purely domestic operations as well as transnational corporations.</p>  <p>  We would wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights. We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles. In this regard, we are of the view that the appropriate place for the discussion of any new initiatives is the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights, which was established in 2011 by the Human Rights Council to serve as a global platform to discuss trends and challenges in the implementation of the Guiding Principles.</p></reply>

Ireland has committed more than &euro;10 million in funding to Colombia since 2007 to prevent conflict, build peace, protect human rights and support the livelihoods of rural populations, including women. </p>  <p>  Ireland was a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, and continues to provide funding to the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund, and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia, in their work to support the implementation of the peace accords. </p>  <p>  We have also facilitated lesson sharing programmes between Ireland and Colombia, based on our own experience of peace building. As we know well in Ireland, the signing of a peace agreement only marks the beginning of a process. We understand the slow and painstaking work that goes into building trust between communities to enable reconciliation and to develop a culture of trust. We have had many dark moments and setbacks, and we understand that peace building is the work of generations.</p>  <p>  Ireland's new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has just recently opened, with Ambassador Alison Milton presenting her credentials last month. This, combined with the opening last year of the first resident Embassy of Colombia in Dublin, marks a tangible strengthening of relations between our two countries, and will greatly enhance our ability to engage on issues on the ground. </p>  <p>  One such important area of engagement is with those local communities and groups that have been most impacted by the armed conflict. Officials at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; have already met with a number of civil society and multilateral organisations, including those working with conflict-affected and rural communities, indigenous and women's groups. My officials engage regularly with the EU delegation and other embassies in Bogot&aacute; on these issues. </p>  <p>  Having a permanent diplomatic presence on the ground will also further enable us to monitor the status of the peace accords closely and to fulfil our commitment to the Government and people of Colombia.  </p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the peace accords in Colombia to ensure a more peaceful future for all Colombians.  We have stressed our continued support for the peace process to the Government of President Iv&aacute;n Duque, including when the Taoiseach met President Duque en marge of the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2018.</p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing to work with the Government of Colombia and with our EU partners to ensure a coordinated and effective approach that best supports the peace process. I can assure the Deputy of our continued commitment the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Colombians. </p></reply>

While initially the protests were against the worsening economic situation, they soon developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation.</p>  <p>  In reaction to the protests, schools have been closed and a state of emergency declared in some regions.  Sudanese police have used tear gas and live ammunition in an attempt to disperse crowds.  It is reported that over 1,000 people have been arrested across the country since protests began and that more than 50 have been killed.  The use of live fire and arbitrary detention cannot be justified.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the 28 February 2019 statement by the EU High Representative expressing concern at the situation in Sudan which underlined the importance of an environment for political dialogue and the exercise of the legitimate right to express differing views. Such an environment would be essential if the national consensus needed to find sustainable responses to Sudan's deep political and economic crisis is to be built.  In addition, Ireland also fully supports the EU statement of 11 January 2019 which calls on the Government of Sudan to release all journalists, members of the opposition, human rights defenders and other protesters arbitrarily detained, and to guarantee the independence of the Investigation Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Sudanese Director of Public Prosecutions, tasked with the investigation of abuses. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which is accredited to Sudan, continues to monitor the situation closely in cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union in Khartoum.</p>  <p>  In addition to the current unrest, Sudan continues to suffer from a range of humanitarian crises, driven by protracted conflicts, inequality and climate change. These feed into the popular disaffection leading to protests. This humanitarian situation has been further exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2018, leading to severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country. More than 1.8 million people are internally displaced and Sudan hosts a further 1.2 million refugees that have fled conflict in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. As a result, an estimated 5.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year, including 2.6 million children. Ireland is responding to these crises, with almost &euro;26 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012.</p></reply>

Our meeting focussed on Troubles legacy issues. </p>  <p>  I made clear to the Secretary of State the Government's deep concern at the statement she had made earlier that day, regarding deaths caused by British soldiers and police during the Troubles, which had caused intense hurt and distress to families who lost loved ones in dreadful circumstances. </p>  <p>  I underlined the need to investigate fully all Troubles related deaths, implement the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework, and honour the commitment under the 2001 Weston Park Agreement for a public inquiry in the Pat Finucane case.</p>  <p>  I reiterated to the Secretary of State the Government's position that there must be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles, regardless of the perpetrator.  I underlined that there are no amnesties from prosecution provided for in the Good Friday Agreement or any subsequent Agreements, including the Stormont House Agreement, and that the Government has been clear that it would not support any proposal to introduce such a measure, for state or non-state actors. </p>  <p>  I also emphasised the imperative of moving ahead with legislation to establish the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies, including to provide an effective system for investigation of outstanding legacy cases in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State acknowledged the deeply-felt concern her comments caused, and stated that this was not intended. Secretary of State Bradley also confirmed the British Government's continuing support for the Stormont House Agreement and its intention to progress the necessary implementing legislation. She also affirmed that all Troubles-related deaths must be effectively investigated in accordance with the law, whatever the circumstances and whoever the perpetrators.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State's subsequent statement on 7 March which apologised for the offence and hurt caused by her statement to families who lost loved ones is important. It is also important that the Secretary of State publicly confirmed that what she had said was wrong, that "where there is any evidence of wrongdoing this should be pursued without fear of favour whoever the perpetrators might be", and that this is and will remain the basis of the British Government's  approach to dealing with legacy issues.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government to seek the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement legacy institutions, in order to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors, for whom delivery of a comprehensive legacy framework is long overdue.</p></reply>

The dinner marked the start of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme in Britain and celebrated the close ties and enduring friendship between our two countries. </p>  <p>   We were joined by approximately 90 guests from across the worlds of politics, culture, business, media and the Irish community in order to mark the vibrant and positive bilateral connections we enjoy together.  </p>  <p>  During his speech at the dinner, Prince Charles reiterated his and the Duchess&rsquo; commitment to developing the relationship and the bonds between our two countries, saying </p>  <p>  &ldquo;We are friends, we are partners and we are the closest of near neighbours, bound together by everything that we have in common &ndash; and by just how far we have come together.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In my own remarks, I spoke of "the extraordinarily vibrant and overwhelmingly positive connections that we now enjoy together - of culture and art, of economics and commerce, of friendship and family."</p>  <p>  The dinner was obviously a social event and not a forum for discussion of policy issues. Therefore, I did not specifically discuss or address the recent letter from the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) to political parties in Northern Ireland on the grave economic implications of Brexit in a no deal scenario. Although I did have a separate meeting  with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the Embassy following the dinner, this focused on legacy issues. </p>  <p>  The letter from the Head of the NICS follows on the UK Government&rsquo;s paper of 26 February which notes that the cumulative impact from a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; scenario is expected to be more severe in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, and to last longer. The letter sets out the work which the Northern Ireland Departments have been doing across a range of sectors in advance of the UK leaving the EU and amplifies the UK Government assessment.  It notes that, despite the considerable amount of mitigation work that has been undertaken to date across Departments, Northern Ireland will face considerable and unavoidable residual risks, notably on the local economy in ways that cannot be mitigated.  </p>  <p>  I share the letter&rsquo;s assessment, including its stark warning about the changes to everyday life, potential border frictions, and the potential for profound and long lasting impact on society. I have repeatedly discussed my concerns around the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland with my British counterparts. I can assure the Deputy that the imperative of avoiding that scenario will continue to inform the Government&rsquo;s approach. Indeed from the outset, I have highlighted the socio-economic risks which Brexit poses for Northern Ireland as well as for the wider political situation there. I have repeatedly stated that a no deal Brexit is in no one&rsquo;s interests, least of all for the people of Northern Ireland who, as the report and letter confirm, will be most affected. Those risks only serve to further highlight the absolute need to agree the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

This is also the official position of the British Government and is provided for in UK statute.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to building on the progress made to establish the comprehensive institutional framework for dealing with the past that is provided for under the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, maintaining the needs of the victims and survivors at the core of our approach.</p>  <p>  I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the leaders of the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek the full implementation of the comprehensive legacy framework of the Stormont House Agreement. This Agreement provides for the establishment of a number of legacy institutions, including the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval and Oral History Archive, which would be accessible to people in Northern Ireland, in this jurisdiction, and in Britain.</p>  <p>  The Stormont House Agreement also includes provisions in respect of services for victims in Northern Ireland which are for implementation by the Executive. The Agreement in addition expressly affirms that the needs of victims who do not live in Northern Ireland should be recognised.</p>  <p>  Consistent with this, the Programme for Government commits to continuing support for victims&rsquo; groups and to promote reconciliation among communities on both sides of the border, which were particularly affected by the Troubles, through the Government&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund and through Ministerial engagement with representatives of different community traditions.</p>  <p>  The Reconciliation Fund is open to applications from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community groups, and voluntary organisations, to support reconciliation and to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. Groups who work with and support victims of the Troubles have made successful applications for support under the Reconciliation Fund. A list of grants awarded is published on my Department&rsquo;s website after each funding round. Reflecting our ongoing deep commitment to supporting the work of reconciliation on this island, the Government has provided for a substantial increase of &euro;1m for the Reconciliation Fund, bringing the total budget to &euro;3.7m with effect from January 2019.</p>  <p>  The Government also contributes significantly to the EU PEACE IV programme (2014 - 2020), and which includes a specific action on Victims and Survivors. This action is delivered by the Victims and Survivors Service in Northern Ireland which provides funding supports to organisations to employ Health and Wellbeing Case Managers, Health and Wellbeing Caseworkers, Advocacy Case Managers and Advocacy Caseworkers for victims and survivors irrespective of their place of residence.</p>  <p>  A Remembrance Commission was established in 2003 and operated a Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance for Victims of the Troubles in this jurisdiction. The Commission's term of appointment formally came to an end on 31 October 2008 and the Commission disbursed over &euro;6.5m to victims and their families in this time. On the conclusion of the Commission's term of appointment, the then Minister for Justice and Equality made special arrangements to ensure that victims resident in the jurisdiction who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the Troubles may have these costs reimbursed through the Victims of Crime Office of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Access to medical services in this jurisdiction, including access to counselling, is a matter for the HSE and my colleague, the Minister for Health. I have not had specific discussions with the Minister in this regard; however, I am ready to do so if there are specific suggestions to consider.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have valued the opportunity to meet with victims&rsquo; families and with survivors of Troubles-related attacks, North and South on the island of Ireland and in Britain, to hear their views, experiences and concerns. As the Government continues work to implement the legacy framework of the Stormont House Agreement, we will maintain our ongoing engagement with victims groups, to take account of their views and maintain their needs at the core of our approach.</p></reply>

My Department regularly engages on my behalf with SEFF, which provides access to well-being and advocacy services for a significant number of victims' families and survivors of Troubles-related attacks both in Northern Ireland and in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department's engagement with SEFF has included attendance at SEFF's annual conference and visits to the group's centre in Fermanagh. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has facilitated SEFF in organising events in this jurisdiction to engage with victims families and survivors here, most recently in July last year, as part of SEFF's advocacy engagement on the UK government's public consultation on draft legislation to establish the legacy institutions provided for under the 2014 Stormont House Agreement. SEFF successfully applied for funding under my Department's Reconciliation Fund in 2015. My Department will continue this constructive engagement with SEFF in the period ahead. </p>  <p>  The Government also contributes significantly to the EU PEACE IV programme (2014-2020), and which includes a specific action on Victims and Survivors. This action is delivered by the Victims and Survivors Service in Northern Ireland which provides funding supports to organisations - including SEFF - to employ Health and Wellbeing Case Managers, Health and Wellbeing Caseworkers, Advocacy Case Managers and Advocacy Caseworkers for victims and survivors irrespective of their place of residence.</p>  <p>  This engagement and funding support from the Government is part of our commitment, set out in the Programme for Partnership Government, to continue support for victims&rsquo; groups and to promote reconciliation among communities on both sides of the border, which were particularly affected by the Troubles. This support is also channelled through the Government&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund and through Ministerial engagement with representatives of different community traditions. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have valued the opportunity to meet with victims&rsquo; families and with survivors of Troubles-related attacks, North and South on the island of Ireland and in Britain, to hear their views, experiences and concerns.</p>  <p>  Consistent with our commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government, as the Government continues work to implement the legacy framework of the Stormont House Agreement to address the legacy of the past, we will maintain our engagement with victims groups as well as victims' families and survivors, to take account of their views and maintain their needs at the core of our approach.</p></reply>

I also remain in contact with my UK counterparts, and spoke with David Lidington during my visit to London late last week.</p>  <p>  There have been an intensive series of meeting between the EU and the UK over the past few weeks, including between the British Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, the UK Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier. The Commission has been working with the UK to agree language with a view towards the meaningful vote in Westminster, without reopening or contradicting the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop.</p>  <p>  On 11 May Prime Minister May and President Juncker agreed a package of measures comprising of an &ldquo;Instrument relating to the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Joint Statement supplementing the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  There was constant contact between our team and the Commission's team over the last number of days as these documents were being developed. The Taoiseach also spoke by phone with President Juncker before the package was agreed with Prime Minister May. </p>  <p>  These documents are complementary to the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration and aim to provide an additional layer of interpretation, clarification and elaboration to the United Kingdom. They provide the legal assurances sought by the UK on the temporary nature of the backstop, as well as additions to the political declaration on the future relationship setting clearly our commitment to finding alternative arrangements to the backstop.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomes this agreement, and is prepared to back this package of measures in the interests of securing an overall deal. As we have said all along, the backstop is an insurance policy. We have no intention of wishing to trap the UK into an arrangement against its will. The Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop does not do this, but does provide the guarantees that a hard border will be avoided and that the Good Friday Agreement is fully protected.</p>  <p>  The EU is fully committed to exploring alternative arrangements so that the backstop is never used, or would only apply temporarily if it ever needs to be used. The agreed package makes clear that work on these alternative arrangements will begin as soon as the Withdrawal Agreement is signed. </p>  <p>  This has not been an easy process and compromise has been shown on both sides. We hope that with these further assurances the House of Commons will approve the Withdrawal Agreement. This is the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal that fully protects the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.</p></reply>

A complete description of the item being imported would be required in order to give a full customs tariff classification, this is particularly important for the importation of car parts and accessories. In the case of new or used vehicles imported from a third country, customs duty is chargeable at importation in the normal way, unless the trader has been authorised by Revenue for the deferral of taxes and duties. </p>  <p>  Full details of the customs procedures are available on Revenue&rsquo;s dedicated Brexit website www.revenue.ie/brexit. If further information is required in relation to customs procedures, these can be addressed to brexitqueries@revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  In relation to VAT, vehicles that are acquired from Italy and transited through the United Kingdom will be subject to the current VAT rules. Vehicles imported from the UK will be subject to VAT at the point of importation.</p>  <p>  In order to alleviate the cash flow burden on Irish businesses post Brexit, I have legislated for postponed accounting for import VAT.  Under this system, importers will not pay import VAT at the point of entry but will instead account for import VAT through their VAT return, so that it is reclaimed at the same time that it is declared - a straightforward simultaneous in/out accounting transaction, without the need to pay the import VAT at the point of entry to the State.  Use of postponed accounting will be optional and will be available to all traders in Ireland who trade with operators in countries outside of the European Union for a time after Brexit, after which continuation of the facility will be subject to conditions, to be set by the Revenue Commissioners at a later date.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer insurance cover and what terms to apply.  My understanding also is that insurance companies do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  Notwithstanding the above, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland on foot of the Deputy&rsquo;s query to understand more about the process.  Insurance Ireland advised that generally the key factor that insurers consider in terms of the scenarios outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is if the home owner is permanently occupying the premises as their main residence.  There was no indication from the companies surveyed that cover was not available to home owners who sought to take advantage of the rent-a room scheme.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that personal consumers have sufficient clarity about the precise nature and scale of the benefit of an incentive to them, including the potential impact of an associated incentive on the cost of their mortgage. This rule in the Code requires lenders to provide consumers with information needed by them to consider the incentive offered. This information must:</p>  <p>  - quantify the implications for the consumer of availing of the incentive including an indicative cost comparison of the total cost of the existing mortgage if they do not avail of the incentive and the total cost of the mortgage if they avail of the incentive;</p>  <p>  - clearly set out the length of time during which the incentive will be available;</p>  <p>  - clearly set out any assumptions used, which must be reasonable and justifiable;</p>  <p>  - set out the advantages and disadvantages to the personal consumer of availing of the incentive;</p>  <p>  - include other key information which the personal consumer should have available to them when considering the incentive; and</p>  <p>  - include a statement that the personal consumer may wish to seek independent advice prior to availing of the incentive.</p>  <p>  In relation to the advertising of mortgage products, including incentives, the Code already contains an extensive suite of advertising rules with which regulated firms must comply. These include requirements that the design, presentation and content of all advertisements must be clear, fair, accurate and not misleading, and must not seek to influence a consumer&rsquo;s attitude to the product of the entity by ambiguity, exaggeration or omission. Key information must be prominent and not obscured or disguised in any way. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank undertook a review of mortgage related advertising in 2018, with a focus on cash back incentives, to assess whether or not lenders were advertising mortgages with cashback offers in a clear and unambiguous way.  The Bank advises that 183 advertisements were reviewed for compliance with the advertising requirements in the Code and the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016. In some cases, the same advertisement may have appeared across all formats of advertising reviewed (e.g. print, on-line, outdoor advertising etc). </p>  <p>  As a result of the review, the Central Bank advised that it instructed lenders to withdraw or amend c.75% of the advertisements reviewed. In summary, it was found that:  </p>  <p>  (a) key information and qualifying criteria was not always included in the main body of the advertisements, or indeed in the small print (e.g. whether a current account with the lender was required in order to qualify); </p>  <p>  (b) the content of some webpages was not accurate and/or up to date; and </p>  <p>  (c) the content of some of the advertisements was unclear (e.g. how the cash back incentive was calculated).</p></reply>

Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, credit intermediaries are authorised by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the CCPC advises that, when performing intermediary functions, credit intermediaries are required to disclose certain information in writing to the consumer including that the intermediary receives a commission, payment or consideration of any kind from an undertaking for arranging any such financial accommodation.</p>  <p>  While intermediaries are frequently involved in the process, hire purchase agreements are ultimately provided by hire purchase providers and these providers are the entity which is the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the good let to the consumer under the hire purchase agreement.  While hire-purchase providers themselves are not required to obtain authorisation from the Central Bank (or the CCPC) for the provision of hire-purchase agreements, nevertheless this is an activity which is subject to statutory control and which contains important consumer protections.  For example, Parts II and VI of the Consumer Credit Act (both of which fall within Central Bank designated provisions of the Act) provide that important information be disclosed in advertisements for hire purchase agreements and also in the agreements as entered into by consumers.  This includes information on the cash price of the good, as well as the APR and hire purchase price. My officials have checked with both the CCPC and the Central Bank and neither entity has seen any evidence of the practices in the UK as referred to in the question operating in Ireland.  Also the Bank has indicated that no specific issue in relation to the provision of hire purchase agreements or their associated commission arrangements arose during the consultation process on Intermediary Inducements (CP 116).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, more generally I asked Mr. Michael Tutty to conduct a review of the PCP market and regulatory structure and his report was published by my Department last November.  That report found that there was currently no evidence of consumer detriment arising from PCPs but nevertheless it set out a number of recommendations to help avoid possible problems arising in the future. I have previously indicated that I broadly accept the recommendations and conclusions of the Tutty report.  Nevertheless, in line with some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations my Department is currently consulting the Office of the Attorney General on some specific issues raised in the report, and when a response is to hand my Department will further engage with the Central Bank, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the CCPC on this matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.232.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200062#WRD05500"><p>Allegations of companies engaging in what has been termed as &lsquo;claims harvesting&rsquo; practices were brought up during the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s consultation process, as well as through representations and Parliamentary Questions submitted by, for instance, the Alliance for Insurance Reform and the Deputy himself previously.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Insurance Policy section has undertaken research in respect of Claims Management Companies (CMCs), including engagements with relevant parties, most particularly the Law Society of Ireland and the Claims Management Regulation Unit, the UK body set up within the Ministry of Justice to regulate CMCs there.  Following this examination, I do not believe there is a compelling argument at present for putting in place a regulatory regime for CMCs in Ireland for a number of reasons, which are set out below.</p>  <p>  Firstly, and most importantly, there does not appear to be a sufficient number of CMCs operating in the Irish market to justify the establishment of a specific regulator.  The Department has been advised by those with a level of expertise in this area that the number of active &lsquo;claims harvesting&rsquo; websites operating in Ireland has significantly  reduced from approximately 60 in 2016 to around half-a-dozen more recently.  The Department has also been advised that between about 23 and 40 websites have been taken down directly as a result of the Law Society&rsquo;s work in this area, at least two as a result of Orders from the President of the High Court following arduous and complex investigations.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, it would appear that many of the websites which are operating in Ireland may not actually be located within the jurisdiction nor within other EU countries.  I understand that this factor increases the levels of complexity of investigations, as it can be particularly difficult to establish who the owners of the relevant websites are.  My view, and that of the Department, is that in such circumstances it would be just as problematic for a specially appointed supervisor to determine basic facts such as ownership. Therefore, from a cost benefit perspective, it is difficult to justify incurring significant costs to establish such a role. </p>  <p>  Thirdly, we have stringent rules in relation to how solicitors can operate in relation to advertising and generating business.  In particular,   </p>  <p>  -  the Solicitors (Advertising) Regulations 2002 prohibits solicitors&rsquo; advertisements offering inducements to make personal injuries claims, and</p>  <p>  -  Section 62 of the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business, i.e., payment of a referral fee.</p>  <p>  This is in contrast to the situation in the UK for example. The Irish rules are significant deterrents and are actively enforced by the Law Society. </p>  <p>  Fourthly, it is our view that the setting up of a supervisor would afford CMCs a level of legitimacy and recognition which is certainly currently absent in Ireland.  It would appear based on my officials&rsquo; conversations with the UK authorities that the referral fee ban has been widely circumvented there to at least some degree without the relevant entities losing their authorisation.  This would appear to show that the tolerance level for referral fees is far higher in the UK than it is here.  This is reflected in the fact that CMCs are seen as legitimate businesses in the UK and much of the regulatory work which the supervisor undertakes is related to matters of consumer protection, consumer awareness and ensuring adherence to applicable rules, rather than seeking to eliminate what we would consider as &lsquo;claims harvesting&rsquo;-type activity.  </p>  <p>  The UK supervisor also seeks to ensure adherence to relevant advertising regulations, but again the regulations in this country appear to be far more stringent, with, for example, a &lsquo;no win, no fee&rsquo; policy being openly advertised on the main authorised Personal Injury CMC websites in the UK.  As you are aware, such advertising is prohibited in this country.</p>  <p>  My view is that the existing solicitor regulations have helped prevent the type of situation currently pertaining in the UK from evolving to anywhere near the same extent here. </p>  <p>  In conclusion therefore, at this point in time, I do not believe a compelling case for regulation can be made from a cost benefit analysis perspective. It should be noted that under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, when commenced, such advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present but by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. Specifically, section 218(d)(vi) of the 2015 Act allows for the restriction of any advertisement which, in the opinion of the Authority, &ldquo;expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make claims for personal injuries or seek legal services in connection with such claims.&rdquo;  The Authority will be undertaking consultations for the making of regulations for the advertising of legal services by legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  The Legal Services Regulatory Authority is expected to take over this responsibility in July 2019.  </p>  <p>  I will, of course, keep the situation under review, and my officials will continue to monitor the prevalence or otherwise of this issue.  In addition, I would suggest that if anyone is of the view that particular solicitor firms are using such claim harvesting websites, they should report the matter to the Law Society/ Legal Services Regulatory Authority for investigation.</p></reply>

SSDT applies on a volumetric basis at one of two rates, dependent on the total sugar content of the &lsquo;ready to consume&rsquo; form of the sugar sweetened drink: &euro;16.26 per hectolitre on drinks with a total sugar content of at least five and less than eight grams per 100 millilitres and &euro;24.39 per hectolitre on drinks with a total sugar content of eight grams or more per 100 millilitres.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that SSDT yield for 2018 totalled &euro;16.51m and that at the end of February 2019 SSDT yield for 2019 totalled &euro;6.5m. The SSDT yield estimate for 2019 is &euro;35m. </p>  <p>  In response to Ireland&rsquo;s formal notification of the tax, the European Commission confirmed that the measures did not constitute a State aid under EU rules. This decision was given on the basis that Ireland had committed to extend the scope of the tax to certain drinks, within CN Code heading 2202, that do not meet specific health benefit criteria, defined as containing at least 119 milligrams of calcium per 100 millilitres.</p>  <p>  In order to meet this commitment, SSDT legislation was amended in Finance Act 2018 to bring defined categories of drinks that do not contain at least 119 milligrams of calcium per 100 millilitres within scope of SSDT. The legislative amendments, which came into effect on 1 January 2019, impacted on sugar sweetened plant protein drinks and drinks containing milk fats, that fall within CN Code heading 2202. These drinks, that were previously excluded from taxation, are subject to SSDT if they have a total sugar content of 5 grams or more per 100 millilitres and do not carry nutritional information indicating a calcium content of at least 119 milligrams per 100 millilitres. </p>  <p>  The types of drinks within CN Code heading 2202 that were impacted by the legislative changes are those covered by five specific subheadings;</p>  <p>  a) Plant protein drinks such as those based on soya, nuts, cereals and seeds (covered by CN Code subheadings 2202 99 11, 2202 99 15);</p>  <p>  b) Drinks containing milk fats (covered by CN Code subheadings 2202 99 91, 2202 99 95 and 2202 99 99)</p>  <p>  Information is not available on the number of products affected by the imposition of a calcium threshold and I am advised that Revenue does not maintain a list of products that are liable to SSDT. </p>  <p>  The commencement of the SSDT on 1 May last was in line with one of the recommendations in the National Obesity Policy and Action Plan. It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity. Work is underway on the development of an evaluation framework for this tax in conjunction with the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The question of considering further fiscal measures similar to the SSDT is being kept under review in conjunction with the Dept of Health and the National Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group. We are in the early implementation phase of the SSDT and the priority of my Department is to ensure that this is a success rather than to plan for the introduction of any new taxes with a similar purpose.</p></reply>

The VAT treatment of food and drink in Ireland is varied and has developed over time.  Most basic foods apply at the zero rate under an historical derogation from the normal VAT rules. Catered food primarily applies at the 13.5% reduced rate, including hot beverages. Most drinks apply at the standard VAT rate, including alcohol, soft drinks, bottled water and fruit juices.</p>  <p>  VAT rates are reviewed annually in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill cycle.  However, any changes to VAT rating are restricted by EU VAT rules.  If the VAT rate on food or drink that currently applies at the zero rate were to be increased, it would not be possible to return that food or drink to the zero rate at a later date.  In addition, it is not possible to apply the zero rate to any new food or drink that has not applied at that rate on and from 1 January 1991.</p>  <p>  The European Commission published a proposal in January 2018 which aims to simplify VAT rating, allowing Member States greater freedom in setting VAT rates.  The proposal has not yet progressed at EU Council.  It is expected that discussions on the proposal will be robust and will provide for an opportunity to undertake a fuller examination of the VAT rates in general, including those applicable to food and drink.</p>  <p>  Separate from the EU policy on VAT rating, one of the main principles of EU VAT law is fiscal neutrality, which provides that different VAT rates cannot apply to goods that are considered the same.  For example, it is not possible to apply different VAT rates to restaurant services based on the nutritional value of the food being served.  </p>  <p>  EU VAT rules also dictate that a Member State can only apply a limited number of VAT rates, which would similarly be the case under the Commission's revised system. As such, any determination in respect of categories of foods would have to be limited to the available number of VAT rates, while also considering any additional complexity and administrative burden that could be generated, both for business and tax administrations. </p></reply>

In Budget 2017, the Group A threshold which generally applies to gifts to or ineritances by children, adopted children and some foster children, was increased from &euro;280,000 to &euro;310,000 and in Budget 2019 was increased to &euro;320,000. The Group B threshold, which generally applies to gifts to or inheritances by nephews. nieces, brothers, sisters and which is the subject of the Deputy's question, was increased in Budget 2017 from &euro;30,150 to &euro;32,000.  In additon the Category C threshold which applies to all other categories was increased from &euro;15,075 to &euro;16,250. These changes have been introduced where resources allow and in the light of competing priorities. </p>  <p>  I would add that in relation to the threshold for nieces/nephews (Group B), there is a specific relief from CAT available in certain circumstances, known as the CAT favourite niece or nephew relief. This applies to the inheritance of business or agricultural property where certain conditions are met. Where the niece or nephew has worked substantially on a full-time basis for 5 years prior to inheritance, they are entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;320,000 when calculating their CAT liability for the inheritance, rather than the Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500). In order to qualify for this relief, the nephew/niece must work for the disponer for a minimum number of hours per week (either 15 or 24, depending on the size of the business/farm). </p>  <p>  The aim of this relief is to target nieces/nephews who have placed their labour and expertise at the disposal of the disponer for an ongoing period, to the benefit of the business. This relief applies to all businesses, including farming.  </p>  <p>  Consideration of possible changes to CAT rates and thresholds, including in respect of inheritances or gifts to nephews and nieces generally takes place as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. </p></reply>

As the day to day supervision of insurance undertakings is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, my officials consulted with he Bank in respect of the information sought and it has confirmed that it does not collect this information either. </p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of insurance for returning emigrants, it is important to note that neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the difficulties faced by returning emigrants in respect of motor insurance was recognised by the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Motor report.  In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that in fulfilment of one of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.</p>  <p>  The Minister for the Diaspora and International Development, Mr Ciar&aacute;n Cannon TD, has undertaken some further work in this area, through the Interdepartmental Committee on the Irish Abroad.  This has included highlighting each individual motor insurance operator&rsquo;s overall policy in respect of returning emigrants.  The insurers which responded positively in relation to providing cover for this category are listed on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.  These insurers have also indicated that they do, in one way or another, take into account claims-free driving experience earned abroad.  </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that if a returning emigrant believes that they have received a high quote due to an insurance provider not accepting driving experience gained while abroad, they should contact the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761820. </p>  <p>  Finally, I remain of the view that the continued implementation of all the recommendations from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance &ndash; in addition to those in the CIWG&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance and the two reports of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the CSO CPI statistics indicate that pricing in the private motor insurance market has stabilised over the last year or two and I welcome the direction of travel which this index has displayed since it peaked in July 2016. </p></reply>

As the day to day supervision of insurance undertakings is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, my officials have consulted with the Central Bank in respect of the information sought and it has confirmed that it does not collect this information either. </p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of insurance for cars over 10 years old, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my officials engaged with Insurance Ireland in order to get a greater sense of this specific issue and, as a follow-up exercise, Minister of State D'Arcy held a series of meetings with the Chief Executives of the major motor insurers.  At those meetings, insurers pointed out that in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, they will, aside from the age of the vehicle, use a combination of other rating factors, which include the age of the driver, the type of vehicle, the relevant individual claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, and how the car is used.  In addition to the above factors, they indicated that they will price in accordance with their own overall past claims experience and in this regard, almost all insurers stated that their data indicates a notable deterioration in the levels of claims associated with vehicles once a certain age threshold is reached.  </p>  <p>  However, I also understand from the above engagement that it would appear there has been positive movement in respect of the acceptance criteria and the vehicle age threshold levels used by some providers in recent times, particularly at broker level and in respect of renewals.  This is an issue which my officials will continue to monitor.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that if a person is having difficulty securing a quotation or believes that they have received a high quotation as a result of having a car older than 10 years old, they should contact the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761820. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am hopeful that the continued implementation of all the recommendations from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance &ndash; in addition to those in the CIWG&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance and the two reports of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market. </p></reply>

It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.</p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  </p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;</p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution</p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions that they offer, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered and lenders are not required to offer a particular solution to a borrower.  </p>  <p>  The CCMA also provides that a lender must prepare and make available to borrowers, an information booklet providing details of its MARP, which must include an explanation of all ARAs available from that lender and any other options offered by the lender (other than alternative repayment arrangements), such as mortgage to rent, voluntary surrender, voluntary sale, and trading down, and a statement that the availability of these options are subject to an individual assessment of each case and meeting the lender&rsquo;s (or a third party&rsquo;s) criteria.</p>  <p>  The CCMA also sets out a procedure that lenders must follow where the following circumstances arise: </p>  <p>  -  where a lender classified a borrower as not co-operating (provision 29), or </p>  <p>  -  where a lender concludes that an alternative repayment arrangement is unlikely to be appropriate (provision 45), or</p>  <p>  -  where a borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender (provision 47)</p>  <p>  Again, the procedure to be followed by the lender in any of these circumstances is that it must inform the borrower on paper or another durable medium of other options available to the borrower, such as mortgage to rent, voluntary surrender, trading down, or voluntary sale, and the implications of these for the borrower and the borrower&rsquo;s mortgage loan account.</p></reply>

Further to this, for the year 2024, my Department has forecasted a contribution of &euro;3.5bn. As part of the Stability Programme Update, these forecasts will be updated in the coming weeks. However, it is worth noting that these forecasts are contingent on a number of variables, including updated GNI forecasts, the size of the overall EU budget for the year and other EU budget operational developments. As a result, all forecasts will be monitored and updated on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that forecasts for the years 2021 onwards are based on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the next MFF which allows for Brexit with Own Resources based on the remaining 27 Member States only. Under the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and UK, the UK had agreed to continue to pay into the EU budget for the remaining years of the current MFF, as if it was still a member. If adopted this would result in no additional impact on Ireland&rsquo;s contributions or receipts up to the end of the current MFF in 2020.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 21 of 2018) was enacted in July 2018. The Act inter alia provides for revised arrangements for the on-going administration of the Insurance Compensation Fund ("ICF"), including for the relevant applications to the President of the High Court. The most recent tranche of payments to Setanta claimants took place in late November 2018. </p>  <p>  To date, 670 personal injury claimants have been compensated in full. The liquidator of Setanta has informed me that since the last application was submitted, a further 125 personal injury claimants have now been agreed and these will be included in the next submission to the Fund bringing the total number of personal injury claimants who have agreed settlements to 795. There are a further 411 personal injury claimants who have yet to settle their claims.

Any person expecting such a payment but who hasn&rsquo;t received it should make contact with their own solicitor to establish why they haven&rsquo;t received the payment. If their solicitor similarly hasn&rsquo;t received the payment, he/she should contact the solicitor firm that represented Setanta on the claim.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to court procedures.

In addition, I have responsibility for overall macroeconomic policy and fiscal sustainability. I think it's important to point out that individuals are incentivised to save for retirement through tax policy measures. The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the investment income and gains of pension schemes and pension saving arrangements, approved by the Revenue Commissioners, are generally exempt from taxation while they remain in the scheme or arrangement. This tax exempt treatment of investment growth together with the exemption from tax on ongoing contributions paid into pension funds are intended to encourage individuals to provide themselves with an adequate income in retirement.</p>  <p>  In relation to the transposition of the Directive (EU) 2016/2341, on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs), also known as IORP II, the Deputy is probably aware that this matter is a policy matter for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and her Department. </p>  <p>  Many of the provisions being implemented by IORP II will support positive reform of the Irish occupational pension sector with aims to ensure good governance, the provision of information to scheme members and the transparency and safety of occupational retirement provision. Given the level of incentives available and the importance of individuals having sufficient savings to adequately provide for their retirement, I believe it's imperative that all pension schemes are subject to sound protections for pensions and consumers, to ensure that money saved for pension purposes is properly protected. </p>  <p>  I am aware on implementation of IORP II,  that single member schemes, including Small Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SSAPS), previously outside of the scope of the investment and borrowing IORP I provisions, will be subject to IORP II provisions. I have been informed by DEASP that the application of the Directive is not retrospective, but prospective, so those changes will not affect existing investments and borrowings by schemes. However, from transposition onwards, single member schemes will no longer be permitted to enter into new borrowing agreements, except for short term and liquidity purposes, and all future investments will have to be carried out in accordance with the Directive rules. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am supportive of the principle of improved regulation and consumer protection for pension savers as reflected in IORP II. Also, given that the State incentivises pension savings, I believe it is appropriate that limits are placed on the nature and riskiness of assets held by pension savers.</p></reply>

Pursuant to these rights I, as Minister for Finance, can appoint up to two directors to the boards of both AIB and PTSB and one director to the board of Bank of Ireland. </p><p>My Department and the Public Appointment Service, PAS, established a transparent process to identify appropriately skilled candidates for nomination to the three banks in which the State holds a shareholding. This includes the establishment of assessment panels to review, assess, interview and compile a list of suitable applicants following which a preferred candidate(s) will be selected by myself, as Minister for Finance. This preferred candidate would then be proposed as the Ministerial nominee to the relevant bank, who in turn will conduct the required governance and submit the candidate for SSM approval in line with their regulatory requirements. The entire process takes over 6 months to conclude. </p><p>In 2018 separate processes began in AIB, PTSB and BOI to appoint new state nominated directors under the updated process. In regards to AIB the preferred candidates have been proposed to the bank and are currently undergoing the standard fitness and probity assessments by the regulators. The processes at PTSB and BOI are ongoing. </p><p>It is important to note that any company director, regardless of whether or not they are a State nominated director, is subject to the requirements of company law to act in what he or she believes to be the interests of the company to which they are appointed. These are the director&rsquo;s fiduciary duties which are owed to the company rather than to the appointing shareholder. However under the Companies Act 2014 (as amended) there is a provision allowing a nominee director to have regard to the interests of the appointing shareholder. </p><p>I would also note that the new appointment procedure for bank directors needs to have due regard to the distinct differences which exist relative to appointments to State boards. These include the requirements of the SSM &lsquo;Fitness and Probity&rsquo; regime and the requirement to have a broad set of expertise relevant to large regulated entities in an ever more complex banking regulatory environment. </p></reply>

This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  The Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, detailed in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.</p>  <p>  The most recent Progress Update was published last week and shows that 24 out of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been accomplished.  I am confident that the two outstanding actions will be completed in the coming months, along with the three remaining action points with deadlines set for various quarters throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  The actions implemented to date cut across a number of different areas and include:</p>  <p>  -  The publication of by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na   </p>  <p>  -  The Law Reform Commission confirming that the subject of caps on damages for personal injuries litigation is included in its draft Fifth Programme of Law Reform</p>  <p>  -  Sections 8 &amp;amp; 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively</p>  <p>  -  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commencing the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system</p>  <p>  -  The Courts Service confirming that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and England &amp;amp; Wales for soft tissue injuries (4.4 times), and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believes that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed (a view which I share)  and he and the Minister for Justice and Equality Mr Charlie Flanagan TD are working closely together to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.298.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200064#WRF00400"><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses or in particular areas.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  As outlined, in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s most recent question on this issue, Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.</p>  <p>  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme within the region of &euro;250 million spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.  The Capital Programme covering the period 2016 to 2021 will see the current annual allocation for flood risk schemes increased from &euro;45 million to &euro;100 million by 2021, representing a total investment of &euro;430 million.  These works will be completed on a prioritised basis.</p>  <p>  This is a coordinated whole-of-Government approach led by OPW with relevant local authorities and other bodies to maximise the level of resources available to address flood relief works.  Due to the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, it is an approach which will see benefits over the medium to long term.</p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed. </p>  <p>  Under the MOU, the OPW requirement is that insurers who are party to the agreement take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes, when assessing exposure to flood risk.  The MOU does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations for which information has been provided by the OPW.  The MOU recognises that the provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers based on the risk they are willing to take on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The role of the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which meets quarterly and the Department of Finance attends, is to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  Therefore, the examination of options or making recommendations for flood insurance for areas which are not included in any tranche of flood defence work does not come under the remit of the group. </p>  <p>  Any person with an insurance-related query or complaint can contact Insurance Ireland's Insurance Information Service (01 676 1914 or feedback@insuranceireland.eu).  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman (01 567 7000 or info@fspo.ie) deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p></reply>

The Act provides for payment of an annual pension equivalent to one eightieth of salary for each year of service capped at forty years&rsquo; service.</p><p>In 1995, the Government decided that full social welfare cover should be extended to all newly appointed civil servants and that they should pay the full Class A social insurance contribution.  This change was introduced under the Social Welfare (Modifications of Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No 77/1995) whereby, with effect from 6 April 1995, all newly recruited civil servants are subject to Class A PRSI.  </p><p>The new rules were notified to civil servants under Circular 6/1995 &ndash; Revised Social Insurance Status and Conditions of Service of Certain Civil Servants.</p><p>In accordance with paragraph 3 of the Circular, and consistent with the Social Welfare Regulations, the new rules apply to persons appointed to established civil service positions on or after 6 April 1995.  The revised superannuation arrangements are set out at paragraph 13, which provides that:</p><blockquote>&quot; ... In the case of officers covered by Class A insurance, the following arrangements will apply:<br /><br />(a) no change will be made in the occupational lump sum; and<blockquote><blockquote>(b) the occupational pension will be calculated on the basis of 1/80th of net pensionable remuneration per year service.  (Net pensionable remuneration means the amount by which pensionable remuneration exceeds twice the annual rate of social insurance old age contributory pension payable at the maximum rate to a person with no adult dependent or qualified children.)  In the case of staff to whom the terms of the Superannuation (Prison Officers) Act, 1919 apply, the pension benefit for each year of service in excess of twenty will be 2/80ths of net pensionable remuneration.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>Paragraph 18 of the Circular provides for payment of a supplementary pension as follows:</p><blockquote>&quot;18. The revised superannuation arrangements include provisions for the payment of a supplementary pension in certain circumstances to pensioners in respect of periods during which the pensioner is not employed in any capacity which involves a social insurance contribution and, due to causes outside his/her own control, fails to qualify for social insurance benefitor qualifies for such benefit at less than the maximum personal rate.  The supplementary pension will be equal to the difference between<br /><br />(i) the occupational pension which would have been payable if it had been based on pensionable remuneration instead of net pensionable remuneration and  <br /><br />(ii) aggregate of the actual occupational pension payable and the actual rate of social insurance benefit payable (including any payments for dependents).&quot;</blockquote><p>It is understood that similar rules apply across the wider public service.  </p><p>The grant of a supplementary pension under paragraph 18 of the Circular is not automatic and is conditional upon a number conditions as follows:</p><blockquote>1. the individual must not be engaged in paid employment;<br /><br />2. he or she does not qualify for social insurance benefit or fail to qualify for such benefit at the maximum rate; and <br /><br />3. his or her failure to qualify must be due to causes outside his or her control.  </blockquote><p>Any queries in respect of the individual mentioned should be directed to the relevant pension paying authority.</p><p>Social Welfare Benefit is defined in the Rules as State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Transition); Illness Benefit, Invalidity Pension or Jobseekers Benefit payable under the Social Welfare Acts or any equivalent contributory benefit, by whatever name called, substituted for any of those benefits in any future enactment amending the Social Welfare Acts.</p></reply>

Prior to its launch, an initial tranche of &euro;200 million of long-term fixed-rate finance was borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency to provide funds for the scheme to local authorities. </p>  <p>  When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years.  From the data collated on the scheme to date, it is clear that there has been a greater demand for the RIHL than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA if it is to continue.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has requested sanction for additional funding of &euro;200m annually for 2019 to 2021.</p>  <p>  I understand the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are presently carrying out an internal review of the scheme.  Further details on the review can be obtained from my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with this review, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are in discussions with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with regard to the scheme.  Upon conclusion of the review and subsequent discussions the Minister for Housing will be in a position to make a statement on the scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.333.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200064#WRF03900"><p>My Department provides for a range of supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is a separate statutory agency, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for the provision of special educational needs supports to schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>All primary and post primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to cater for children with special educational needs.  In September 2017 the Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  All schools have now received revised allocations for September 2019.  DES Circulars 0007/2019 for primary schools and 0008/2019 for post primary schools provide details of how the allocations are being updated for schools from September 2019, based on updated profile data. </p><p>The SET model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.  This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance.  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.</p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website, at <i>www.education.ie/en/The-Education-System/Special-Education/Guidelines-for-Primary-Schools-Supporting-Pupils-with-Special-Educational-Needs-in-Mainstream-Schools.pdf.  </i></p><p>Schools are supported by the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) which delivers a consultative, tiered service delivery model to schools, in line with international best practice for the effective and efficient delivery of educational psychological services that best meet the needs of all pupils/students in schools.  This service delivery model allows NEPS psychologists to support schools to provide an effective continuum of support to meet the needs of pupils/ students. </p><p>Should any students have assessed care needs, the school may apply for access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for those students.</p><p>The NCSE is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  </p><p>Resources provided to schools also include additional training for teachers through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  </p><p>The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs.  The Support Service continues to update current CPD courses and design new CPD courses in response to the needs of teachers. </p><p>Schools can apply for CPD courses directly to the NCSE on their on-line application process at <i>www.sess.ie/ncsesupport</i>.</p><p>The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

In that context, schools are best placed to identify and put in place appropriate policies in the context of their own particular situation, through consultation with their local school community. </p><p>Circular 0038/2018, which issued to all schools, early last year requires all schools to consult with teachers, student and parents in the development of policy around the use of smart phones and personal devices in school.  This consultation requirement will be underpinned in law once the Parents and Students Charter is enacted.  There is no automatic requirement for schools to report on the implementation of circulars to the Department.</p><p>This bottom-up approach will ensure all parents, teachers and school communities are satisfied with the smart phone policy in place in their school.  It will also mean that parents will be able to adopt a complementary approach at home to that which is in place in their child's school, if they wish to do so. </p><p>The intention is to promote a shared approach regarding the appropriate and beneficial use of digital technologies.  The Department recognises that parents are the primary educators of their children, and will prioritise their child&rsquo;s best interests and well-being.  In that context, the input of parents to developing school policies as articulated in the draft <i>Education (Parent &amp;amp; Student Charter) </i>Bill 2018<i>,</i>which notes and mandates that role, is a priority of this Department.</p></reply>

Mechanical components of a building incorporate, among other things, all water systems, including tap drinking water supply.

Primary schools receive a minor works grant too which they can use for this purpose if they so wish.

My Department has dedicated guidelines for Design Teams setting out the standards to be implemented for these construction projects and for all remediation projects.  </p>  <p>  Given the range of components under the mechanical category in my Department&rsquo;s Grant Schemes, records of the detail of the individual grants approved are not held.

The scheme is delivered by 416 full-time HSCL Coordinators who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils.<b></b></p><p>The impact of socio-economic factors on educational outcomes can be different between urban and rural settings and the HSCL scheme takes account of that. While urban and rural disadvantage share many characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment and poor housing conditions, the evidence suggests that disadvantage in a rural context does not have the same impact on educational performance. </p><p>My Department's objective in implementing DEIS Plan 2017 is to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of disadvantage.  To achieve this, additional resources must be targeted as closely as possible at those students with the greatest need in terms of concentrated levels of disadvantage.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that Rural DEIS primary schools continue to be supported through the DEIS programme with a range of additional supports, including grant aid in the form of a DEIS grant, enhanced book grant, access to the DEASP School Meals Programme and priority access for teachers to a range of professional development programmes as well as the Incredible Years and Friends programmes.</p><p>My Department has no plans at present to extend the HSCL scheme to Rural DEIS schools as part of the DEIS programme. It is not possible to give a definitive cost to extend to 75 additional posts, since it is dependent upon a primary or post primary teachers' particular point on the salary scale upon appointment to the role. </p></reply>

I must stress that under the legislation establishing these bodies the bulk of their records would, on the dissolution of those bodies, fall to be destroyed. The records held by these bodies represent the personal testimony and stories of many survivors of residential institutional child abuse and related papers. I believe that these records should not be destroyed both to ensure that future generations will be aware of and understand what happened and out of respect to the victims who came forward. Therefore, if the Bill is enacted these highly sensitive records will be retained.</p>  <p>  The redress bodies operated under stringent confidentiality requirements as laid down in statute and persons engaged with them on that basis. The proposals in the Bill strike a balance between those requirements and the need to preserve these historically important records.</p>  <p>  The proposals contained in the Bill were the subject of normal consultations with other Government departments both at the time the General Scheme of the Bill was finalised in early 2015 and more recently when the text of the Bill was approved for publication. Neither the Information Commissioner nor the Data Protection Commissioner was consulted directly by my officials as part of that process as that would be a matter for the relevant departments. However I can confirm that informal discussions took place with the Data Protection Commissioner.  </p>  <p>  I should point out that the legislation under which the three bodies currently operate restricts the application of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts and the Data Protection Act. The Bill proposes to continue that dis-application in the case of the Freedom of Information Act. If the Bill is enacted and the records are transferred to the National Archives, further processing will be for archiving purposes and the provisions of section 61 of the Data Protection Act 2018 will therefore apply. </p></reply>

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.</p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile.  </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fair allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the level of need in each school. </p><p>Schools are front loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools and to offer them a mechanism to have their special education teaching support hours reviewed.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will publish details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools in the coming days.  </p><p>Schools will be advised that this appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal can be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>Once the appeal process has concluded, a further process will be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. </p><p>I am satisfied that there are therefore in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary, including for the school referred to by the Deputy in his question.</p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.</p><p>There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>There are now more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. </p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.384.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200065#WRG02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 to 151, inclusive, together.</p><p>On 1 January 2019 the first technological university (TU) in the State, Technological University Dublin, which formerly comprised Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and Institute of Technology Tallaght, was established under the Technological Universities Act 2018. This can be regarded as a landmark date in the evolution of Irish higher education. With some 28,000 students, Technological University Dublin became the largest HEI in the State. TU Dublin&rsquo;s main campuses are located in Grangegorman, Tallaght and Blanchardstown.</p><p>On 12 February 2019 the Munster Technological University consortium, comprising Cork IT and IT Tralee, submitted an application to the Minister for Education and Skills seeking TU status under the 2018 Act. The relevant legislative procedures under the Act have commenced in relation to the assessment and decision- making process in relation to this application. </p><p>There are two other consortia of IoTs working to develop TU proposals. These are the Technological University for South East Ireland consortium, comprising Waterford IT and IT Carlow, and the Connaught Ulster Alliance, comprising IT Sligo, Galway Mayo IT and Letterkenny IT. These consortia are understood to be working toward the submission of applications for TU designation under the 2018 Act in 2019 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>In policy terms the National Strategy for Education to 2030 recommended consolidation within the Institute of Technology sector and a pathway of evolution for consolidated institutes of technology (IoTs) to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against stated performance criteria and to become multi-campus technological universities.</p><p>The National Strategy states that smaller, stand-alone institutions such as individual IoTs lack the scale required to deliver necessary advances in quality and efficiency. Universities and IoTs are encouraged to work together collaboratively in regional clusters. Smaller publicly funded institutions are encouraged to align with or be incorporated into institutions of sufficient scale to enable quality and efficiency objectives to be met such as is the case in the area of Initial Teacher Education provision. </p><p>The Programme for Government supports the creation of technological universities. These regional higher education institutions will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on the capacity to create and retain jobs in regions. Government will prioritise those institutions which have clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. </p><p>The Technological Universities Act 2018 which was signed into law on 19 March 2018 provides the legal framework underpinning the process for establishment by two or more IoTs as a TU subject to a decision-making process contingent on the meeting of specified eligibility criteria and including assessment by an international advisory panel. The 2018 Act also sets out the functions and governance requirements for these new HEIs. </p><p>In accordance with National Strategy recommendations, Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a technological university. Section 38 of the Act provides that an institution and an established technological university may also apply to the Minister for such an order.</p><p>The Government has provided the enabling legislation in the Technological Universities Act 2018 for two or more IoTs to come together to seek TU status. Government also continues to support those consortia currently seeking to achieve such status under the legislation in terms of significant Exchequer co-funding. The potential benefits of becoming a successful TU are significant in terms of increased reach, international recognition, research capacity building, FDI attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experience and opportunities and socio-economic progression. The merging of institutes of technology will create institutions of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise those benefits and attract greater investment.</p><p>TUs will be distinguished by a mission and ethos that is aligned and consistent with the current mission and focus of IoTs with an emphasis on programmes at Levels 6 to 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), industry focused research and the development and use of new knowledge through industry-focused research. However, TUs will also offer post-graduate programmes at Levels 9 and 10 on the NFQ.</p><p>TUs will help retain talent in the regions by strengthening the offer available to students who will be able to continue to masters and postgraduate level, including PhDs. Larger management and academic teams permitted by the merger of institutions will increase institutional capacity and will facilitate enhanced performance in areas such as winning research funding.</p><p>TUs will also be expected to play a pivotal role in facilitating access and progression particularly through relationships with the further education and training sector. The presence of a technological university in a region, with a specific mandate for promoting regional development, will have a transformative effect on local and regional communities.  </p><p>By creating institutions of increased scale and capacity, multi-campus TUs will bring greater social and economic benefits to their regions through a strengthened role in research and innovation and the delivery of a broad range of high quality education and training in each of their campuses. It is clear from the progress made with existing consortia and from international exemplars that there is very considerable coherence in sectoral and educational offerings that make a single HEI hub both a catalyst and a magnet for regional economic development and employment.</p><p>The strong regional mission of TUs to support development and innovation is aligned with the objectives of Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework. Enhanced HEIs will deliver the skilled and talented people that sustain enterprise and new investments.<b></b>The National Development Plan 2018 - 2027 cites as a priority the establishment of a clearly prioritised Exchequer-supported higher education building programme including the objective of bolstering the capacity of multi-campus TUs. The current TU development consortia are referenced under Project Ireland 2040 as having a role in deepening the talent pool for distinctive regional clusters and driving research and innovation. TUs will also be well placed to attract increased research funding and to bid for a share of the &euro;4 billion in funding available as part of Project Ireland 2040 over the period 2019 &ndash; 2027 under the four broad themes of rural development, urban development, climate action and disruptive technology. </p><p>It remains at the discretion of each individual IoT whether or not it chooses to join an existing consortium, or to form a new consortium, of institutes to progress together towards making an application for TU status under the 2018 Act. </p><p>Currently four IoTs -  Athlone, Dundalk and Limerick Institutes of Technology and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art Design and Technology - have to date not joined or formed a consortium seeking to develop TU proposals. </p></reply>

In relation to cancelled applications there can be a number of reasons as to why an application may be cancelled, including a cohort that would cancel their application prior to a decision on their grant in order that they can re-apply as a &lsquo;Mature Dependent&rsquo; with detail of the income of parent(s)/guardian(s). </p><p>SUSI works with applicants in relation to the documentary evidence that is required to demonstrate independent residence and will advise of the option to re-apply as a Mature Dependent if an applicant cannot provide the necessary documentation required to validate their application as an &lsquo;independent&rsquo; student. SUSI is mindful of the variety of living arrangements of individuals applying for a grant and publicises a list of documents that are deemed sufficient for demonstrating independent residence. Given the variation in the documents supplied by applicants this is done on a case-by-case basis and dependent upon the range of documents that can affirm independent residence for the required periods.  Often documents are taken in conjunction with one another to assist in the assessment of an applicant as independent. The type of documentation accepted includes:</p><p>- A letter confirming that the address is registered with RTB (Residential Tenancies Board);</p><p>- A Local Authority lease agreement or a letter confirming the rental under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) or any Government Housing Scheme/Arrangement; </p><p>- A letter on headed paper from a Rental Agency confirming tenancy;</p><p>- A letter confirming the receipt and period of Rent Allowance, Mortgage Interest Supplement or Housing Assistance Payment (HAP);</p><p>- A Utility bill in applicant&rsquo;s own name, for example; landline telephone (mobile telephone bills are not accepted), fixed broadband, gas, electricity or cable/satellite television bill/home heating bills/waste bills/Mortgage Statements/Property Tax Letters. If the utility bills in the household are in the spouse&rsquo;s name, then a copy of a marriage certificate is required with the utility bill (if co-habiting SUSI will accept utility bills in the partner&rsquo;s name covering the relevant period together with correspondence e.g. bank statement/P21 issued to the applicant at the same address and covering the relevant period); and/or</p><p>- Official documentation posted to the applicant at the address and relating to their residence there. For example, a letter from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection confirming Rent Allowance at the address.</p></reply>

This is an approach that is supported by Government in terms of ongoing higher education landscape restructuring.</p>  <p>  In terms of the funding of higher education landscape restructuring in 2018 &euro;0.5 million in Exchequer co-funding support was allocated under the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s call for funding proposals to a number of projects with a cross-border strategic dimension.

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory, and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent, guardian, or a pupil who is 18 years or over, to the Secretary General of my Department (or in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, to the ETB in the first instance) where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student, or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p>  <p>  Further information in relation to section 29 appeals is available on my  Department&rsquo; s website or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Department of Education and Skills, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.450.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200066#WRHH02900"><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) advises the Minister on curriculum and assessment at early childhood, primary and post-primary levels. It uses evidence from educational and other research, national and international, along with the valued experience of practitioners and experts, to arrive at this advice.</p><p>NCCA is a statutory, representative body and the approach through which it develops curricula requires that agreement is reached, where possible, with representative stakeholders in education &ndash; including teacher unions, management bodies, parents, the early childhood sector, further and higher education, business interests, and the State Examinations Commission . Increasingly, the pupil and student voice is a source of input and feedback on its advice too.</p><p>Beyond stakeholder involvement, consultation is a feature of the approach taken: there are public consultations on <i>all </i>major policy documents and curricula before advice goes to the Minister.  By the time it does, NCCA has discussed and deliberated, sometimes over a couple of years, so the advice is considered and never offered lightly.</p><p>NCCA develops the specifications for particular subjects and areas of the curriculum. These specifications do not &lsquo;merely set out a list of topics and learning outcomes&rsquo;. For example the recent specification for a new subject, Leaving Certificate Computer Science, included the following material and sections: </p><p>-  An Introduction to the specification  </p><p>- An outline of the senior cycle of Irish education</p><p>- A rationale for the inclusion of Computer Science as a subject</p><p>- The aims and objectives of the course in Computer Science</p><p><b>- </b>Related learning &ndash; how Computer Science can link to other subjects and areas across the curriculum</p><p>- An overview of the Structure of the course in Computer Science</p><p>- An outline of the senior cycle key skills to which it contributes</p><p>- A section on the teaching and learning approaches that are fundamental to Computer Science </p><p>- An outline of the three strands involved in the course and the learning outcomes for each of these strands</p><p>- An outline of how the student&rsquo;s work on the course will be assessed.</p><p>All subject specifications go into this level of detail. In addition, after the finalisation and introduction of the specification, the NCCA publishes Assessment Guidelines. These provide further detail on each of the assessment components, including the final examination and any second assessment components such as projects, practicals, assignments etc. The Assessment Guidelines are developed in collaboration with the State Examinations Commission so that there is clear alignment between the specification and the assessment items in the examinations and assessment briefs administered by the SEC. Increasingly, for example in the case of all recently introduced Junior Cycle subject specifications, the NCCA also develops, on an ongoing basis, exemplification of student work/teaching and learning that demonstrate how learning outcomes in the specification are realised in the classroom or learning site.</p><p>Frequently, as in the case of Leaving Certificate Computer Science, Support Material for Teaching and Learning is also provided.  This package of material, the Specification, the related Assessment Guidelines, the examples of students&rsquo; work, and Support Material for Teaching and Learning is designed to equip teachers with the material they need to successfully teach the relevant course. In addition, of course, the State Examinations Commission also issue teachers and schools with sample papers, and in time, past papers related to the examinations and these too assist teachers in their engagement with the learning outcomes of the course.</p><p>Learning outcomes are statements in curriculum specifications to describe the knowledge, understanding, skills and values students should be able to demonstrate after a period of learning. The DES policy on learning outcomes was set out in the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy in 2011 - A &ldquo;learning outcomes&rdquo; approach needs to be incorporated into all curriculum statements at primary level and in all new syllabuses at post-primary levels as they come on stream. Curricula should state clearly the skills and competences expected of learners at six points in their development (end of early years/infants, end of second class, end of fourth class, end of primary stage, end of junior cycle and end of senior cycle). </p><p>The point raised in this question about whether it would be appropriate to introduce &lsquo;depth of treatment standards&rsquo; relates to the question of how detailed the specification of learning outcomes should be. This is the source of much debate and contestation in the literature on curriculum development and curriculum specification, with long-established as well as newly developing perspectives on both sides of the debate. NCCA keeps the literature on learning outcomes and outcomes-based specification under review and will shortly, in Q2 of 2019, publish a paper reviewing current approaches and views in this area, both in the literature on learning outcomes and in the experience across six jurisdictions worldwide. The paper has been developed in consultation with an expert in the field of curriculum studies, Prof. Mark Priestley of the University of Stirling in Scotland. It is currently the subject of peer review before being published and made available for ongoing discussion.</p></reply>

In approximately 75% of all cases the ward&rsquo;s Committee is a family member or a trusted friend. However, if no suitable or willing relative or friend is available, or if there is a conflict of interest between the ward and the person who would otherwise have been appointed, the President of the High Court can appoint the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court to act as the Committee. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that statements as to the valuation of funds held in court are sent to the Committee of the Estate who has responsibility for property and affairs of the Ward. In a small number of cases a family member is the Committee of the Person only and his or her role is limited to matters of welfare of the ward. However, where a Committee of the Person seeks a summary of the overall amount of funds in court, that summary will be provided to them. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that if such a request has not been responded to, details should be provided to the Registrar of Wards of Court and he will ensure that the matter is dealt with promptly.  </p></reply>

The UN Convention provides that people with disabilities should have the same rights as everyone else and should be provided with the practical supports to make that a reality. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the legal framework for persons who are deemed to lack capacity is currently undergoing significant reform with the current system of wardship being phased out and replaced with a more modern system focussed on assisting and supporting persons who may lack capacity. This new legal framework is provided for under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.    </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. It will repeal the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811 and the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. The current adult wards of court system will be phased out and replaced by a less intrusive system which offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.</p>  <p>  Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides for the phased transition from adult wardship to the new support framework. It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards within three years of the commencement of that Part of the Act.  Following a review of his or her capacity, the ward will be discharged from wardship and depending on the outcome of the review the wardship court may:</p>  <p>  - Declare that the ward does not lack capacity and immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her.</p>  <p>  - Declare that the ward lacks capacity unless a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions. Once a co-decision making agreement is registered the court shall immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her. If there is no suitable person to act as co-decision maker or the co-decision making agreement has not been properly registered within a period set down by the court, then the court shall make orders as appropriate under Part 5 to appoint a decision making representative and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her once a decision making representative has been appointed. </p>  <p>  -  Declare that the ward lacks capacity even if a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions.  The court shall make orders as appropriate under Part 5 to appoint a decision making representative and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her once a decision making representative has been appointed.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Act provides for the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission. New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act, including Part 6, can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.  The Director is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is not yet operational but every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.</p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  On 17 October 2016 the Minister for Health established a multidisciplinary working group to assist in the development and preparation of the code of practice for the AHD provisions of the Act. The role of the working group is to prepare a detailed series of recommendations for the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice. </p>  <p>  In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018). This will enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress the preparation of the code of practice on the AHD provisions, based on the working group&rsquo;s recommendations, and in accordance with the specific process outlined in the Act. The multidisciplinary working group submitted its recommendations on the code of practice to the Director of the Decision Support Service on 21 December 2018. Once completed, the final code of practice can be published by the Director with consent of the Minister for Health. The preparation of the code of practice will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Part 8 of the Act, pertaining to AHDs, in its entirety. </p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Mental Health Commission engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service. The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission has also received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the Decision Support Service and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the Mental Health Commission and Decision Support Service. These staff are being recruited on a phased basis by the Mental Health Commission.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.  These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. Work on the draft regulations is ongoing.</p></reply>

The construction of this station is on-going and the Garda authorities and the OPW advise that completion is expected in early Q3. </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that in order to facilitate the Divisional Policing Model in Cork City, the Cork City Divisional Roads Policing Unit is relocating from Anglesea Street to Ballincollig Garda Station and that works to accommodate the Divisional Roads Policing Unit in Ballincollig Garda Station are scheduled for this year.</p><p>A new station in Macroom is also included in the programme, with delivery of that station along with new stations in Clonmel and Sligo as well as a new custody suite at the station on Anglesea Street Cork to be achieved as part of a Public Private Partnership (PPP)<b></b>arrangement. It is not possible at this point to provide a timeframe for completion of the projects.  However I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new Garda stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p><p>A station in Cork is also included in the pilot station reopening project.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on my Department's website, recommends that Ballinspittle Garda Station be reopened, along with stations in Bawnboy, Co. Cavan, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, Donard, Co. Wicklow, and Rush and Stepaside, Co. Dublin.</p><p>The OPW and Garda authorities are cooperating closely on delivery of these stations. In relation to Ballinspittle, I understand that the OPW proposals for the refurbishment of Ballinspittle Station were agreed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a sign-off meeting in October 2018 and that the next phase of the project is the procurement/tendering of works, which is expected to commence shortly.</p><p>Finally and more generally, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to address minor maintenance issues and refurbishment works across all Divisions as they arise, liaising closely with the OPW and having regard to overall Garda accommodation priorities.</p></reply>

The initiative is being led by the REPPP Project, (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice), at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL). The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with UL which is supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also by my own Department. </p>  <p>  In the absence of international models of intervention that could be readily deployed, the original Greentown report (December 2016) recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. </p>  <p>  I understand that it is intended to commence a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, during 2019. </p>  <p>  More generally, my Department provides funding through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs). These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime/anti-social behaviour.   </p>  <p>  For 2019, IYJS has a renewed emphasis on preventative work by GYDPs, looking at the child in the context of the specific family and the specific community.  This includes family support work and working with children aged 8 to 11.</p>  <p>  IYJS also supports established and planned pilot projects, to help develop better approaches in areas such as engagement with hard-to-reach or more challenging children, as well as family support and other preventative interventions. </p>  <p>  A range of relevant legislative provisions are already in place, including the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, which provides offences for the organisation of child prostitution and related matters. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, as well as the Children Act 2001, provide for several offences relating to the sexual exploitation of children. The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 (as amended), outlaws the trafficking of children for criminal exploitation, and applies to exploitation both within and outside the State. The sanctions for these crimes include, potentially, imprisonment of up to a life sentence for the most serious instances.</p>  <p>  Finally, there are also offences in relation to adults who use or force a child to commit a crime, in particular Section 7 (1) of the Criminal Law Act 1997, as well as offences where a child is used for begging in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011 and the Children Act 2001.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of resources. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 recruits have attested as members and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, some 18 and 41 of whom have been assigned to the Roscommon/Longford and the Galway Divisions respectively.</p><p>The Government has increased the budget by for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.  The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and he also intends to recruit 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase the overall strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 Garda members will be achieved by the target date of 2021. The Government fully supports the Commissioner&rsquo;s management decision which is to ensure that increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; are available for frontline duties in the prevention and detection of criminal activity.</p><p>The Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme implemented during 2012 and 2013 resulted in the closure of 39 Garda stations in 2012 and 100 Garda stations in 2013.  This included 9 stations in the Roscommon/Longford Division and 11 stations in the Galway Division. These are detailed in the table. The primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and occupied by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p><p><b>Garda Station Closures in 2012</b><table><tr><th>Division</th><th>District</th><th>Station</th></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>Castlerea</td><td>Loughglynn</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>Boyle</td><td>Tarmonbarry</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>Boyle</td><td>Cootehall</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Galway</td><td>Corrandulla</td></tr></table><b></b></p><p><b>Garda Station Closures in 2013</b><table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Current District</th><th>Station</th></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/ Longford</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>Ballyforan</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/ Longford</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>Knockcroghery</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/ Longford</td><td>Castlerea</td><td>Ballintubber</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/ Longford</td><td>Longford</td><td>Newtowncashel</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/ Longford</td><td>Granard</td><td>Ballinalee</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/ Longford</td><td>Granard</td><td>Ardagh</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Galway</td><td>Kiltullagh</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Loughrea</td><td>Tynagh</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Loughrea</td><td>New Inn</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Gort</td><td>Shanaglish</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Gort</td><td>Kilchreest</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Gort</td><td>Kilcolgan</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Clifden </td><td>Leeane </td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Ballinasloe</td><td>Menlough</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Tuam</td><td>Kilconly</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>Tuam</td><td>Ballymoe</td></tr></table></p><p>The Garda strength of the Roscommon/Longford and the Galway Divisions from 2009 up to 31 January 2019, as provided by the Garda Commissioner, as provided by the Garda Commissioner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.</p><p>The information regarding new recruits as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.</p><p>For additional and more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link: </p></reply>

I am aware that Garda&iacute; have experienced serious difficulties from an enforcement perspective when attempting to apprehend persons engaging in this dangerous and anti-social behaviour. Interception poses significant risks, not only to the drivers and passengers of these vehicles, but also to members of the public and local Garda&iacute; in affected communities. Most recently, my officials have sought formal views from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning the OAG&rsquo;s legal advice from an enforcement and prosecution perspective. </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials, as a matter of priority, to convene a cross-agency meeting comprising DTTAS, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Advisory Counsel in order to agree specific measures to deal with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes. This meeting is scheduled to take place this Friday, 15 March, and I will be happy to update this House further following this meeting. </p>  <p>  In terms of current legislation available to Garda&iacute; in the context of the matter referred to by the Deputy, DTTAS has highlighted the following key legislative provisions: </p>  <p>  - Scramblers and quad bikes are mechanically propelled vehicles (MPVs), as defined by section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended). Under road traffic legislation, users of MPVs in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, and must also wear a helmet, with severe penalties (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) in the event of non-compliance with these requirements. </p>  <p>  - Section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides that Garda&iacute; can perform an examination of roadworthiness of any vehicle being used in a public place. Failure to comply with specific standards (for example, in relation to brakes and other essential matters) means that a MPV is not considered suitable for use in a public place as defined in road traffic legislation.</p>  <p>  - Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 makes it an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a person under 16 years of age. The supply of such vehicles includes a gift or a loan. Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provides for the detention of vehicles by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for driving without a driving licence, insurance or motor tax. </p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has recourse to a range of public order provisions, including section 13 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 (i.e. offence of endangerment).  </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in certain public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws 2011. </p>  <p>  Insofar as national parks are concerned, my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has legislative powers to prohibit the unauthorised use of off-road vehicles.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of resources.</p><p>Strokestown Garda Station forms part of the Castlerea District in the Roscommon/ Longford Division. The Garda strength of the Roscommon/Longford Division from 2009 to 31 January 2019 as provided by the Garda Commissioner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following links.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. In addition, as you will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise. For this reason, the number of Garda&iacute; available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 recruits have attested as members and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 18 of whom have been assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division.</p><p>The Government has increased the budget by for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.  The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and he also intends to recruit 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the Roscommon/Longford Division.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link: </p></reply>

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. </p>  <p>  Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs through the removal of their ill-gotten gains.</p>  <p>  The Bureau is widely regarded, both nationally and internationally, as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime. The structure and powers of the Bureau have also been modelled by other jurisdictions as a template for countering those seeking to benefit from the proceeds of crime.</p>  <p>  The Bureau works closely with Garda&iacute; and all law enforcement agencies at national and international levels and continues to focus its efforts on targeting assets deriving from all types of criminal conduct.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity, and to disrupt criminal enterprises and deprive criminals of the benefits of their ill-gotten gains. In doing so, the actions of the Bureau sends a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the Government's commitment to ensure that the Bureau is adequately resourced, the CAB&rsquo;s staffing and budgetary allocation has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2016, the Bureau's staffing resources have increased from 71 to 89, while its budgetary allocation has gone up from &euro;7.042 million in 2016 to &euro;8.648m in 2018.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the increased resources of the CAB have given rise to substantially increased levels of Bureau activity in recent years, and its successful operations have become a regular feature in media reports. In 2018, the Bureau brought 30 new Proceeds of Crime proceedings before the High Court, up from 28 in 2017 and 13 in 2016. This is the largest number of new cases ever commenced by the Bureau in a single year. Likewise, the money returned to the State as a result of CAB actions increased from &euro;3.8 million in 2016 to &euro;4.3 million in 2017.  I understand that provisional figures indicate that this figure is in excess of &euro;5.6 million for 2018.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the number of asset profiles submitted to the Bureau, by the nationwide network of asset profilers, increased from 66 in 2016 to 184 in 2018, a 178 per cent increase. This increase has been driven by the increased numbers of Garda, Revenue and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection personnel who have been trained as Asset Profilers.  There is now a national network of some 378 trained asset profilers as compared with 279 profilers at the end of 2017.</p></reply>

As of the same date, there were approximately 2,530 Garda Staff employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertaking a range of administrative and technical duties in the organisation.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieve an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  Since the re-opening of Templemore College in September 2014,  approximately 2,600 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to duties in communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  This approach to continue and increase recruitment of both Garda&iacute; and Garda Staff is very much in line with the recommendations of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland which Government approved in December. The Government also at that time published an implementation plan &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo; which among its actions will include the recruitment on 600 Garda in 2019 and the redeployment of 500 Garda to visible front line duties and the recruitment of 600 Garda Staff.</p>  <p>  These proposals will ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country which will maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p></reply>

This investment is in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Significant capital investment is also being made in the Garda estate.  The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The Garda Station Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities, which continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country. The clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and to provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them. This work is being progressed in a planned and structured way. </p>  <p>  For example, I am informed by the Garda authorities that works continuing under this programme in 2019 includes the new station and immigration centre at Transaer House, Dublin Airport as well as major refurbishment of Athlone Garda station. The programme includes construction of a new Garda station in Glanmire, Co. Cork and development of a new station in Bailiborough, Co. Cavan.  Other works planned for 2019 include planned remedial works in Henry Street station, Co. Limerick and Ballincollig, Co. Cork.  I am further informed that work is ongoing to progress plans for the development of Property and Evidence Management Stores at stations in Naas, Co. Kildare, Drogheda, Co. Louth and Tallaght, DMR South. </p>  <p>  I understand that as part of the programme, the Custody Management Facilities in Carlow Garda station will be refurbished this year.  Works at a further 17 stations nationwide will also be carried out under the Cell Refurbishment Programme, under which the cells at over 80 Garda Stations have been completed to date. </p>  <p>  I understand that a contract has recently been awarded in relation to the provision of upgraded facilities for the Garda Water Unit in Athlone, Co. Westmeath.  The refurbishment of Ashtown Gate on the Navan Road, Dublin will be completed in Q1 2019 and a modular building extension in Garda Headquarters is also nearing completion.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the Building and Refurbishment Programme, a number of other major projects are advancing in relation to the Garda estate and will continue in 2019. </p>  <p>  For example I understand that enabling works to refurbish Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station commenced in 2018. I am informed that the OPW is at an advanced stage in the design of the Garda facility to be located at Military Road, Dublin 8.  The Pilot Garda station Reopening Project continues to progress and I understand that the OPW expects work at all 6 stations included in that project to be complete this year.</p>  <p>  These are some of the many works to the Garda estate now ongoing, on the basis of agreed Garda priorities. I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and OPW continue to work on the remaining projects under the Garda Station Building and Refurbishment Programme, all of which are at various stages of design, development or procurement. I further understand that they seek to deal with other maintenance or minor works requirements as they arise, subject to availability of resources and overall Garda accommodation priorities.</p></reply>

Automated Number Plate Recognition technology is available in a number of Garda vehicles.  ICT technology is also deployed in air support units and mobile command vehicles providing on-site connectivity to Garda ICT systems and communications.</p>  <p>  In terms of ICT systems, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a broad range of ICT projects and initiatives are being progressed to support existing systems and develop them further, with the overall goal of supporting the ongoing business requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all fields and enabling them to deploy the latest, cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime. </p>  <p>  For example, I am  informed that a number of key ICT initiatives are moving to implementation phase this year, including projects such as:</p>  <p> - roll out of the Rosters and Duty Management System, which will give supervisors better and faster information on the resources available to them; </p>  <p> - phased implementation of the Mobility project, which aims to provide operational Garda members with secure mobile access to Garda systems;</p>  <p> - roll out on a pilot basis of the Investigations Management System, which will standardise, digitise and support the management of all investigations arising from a  PULSE incident; and</p>  <p> - establishment of the remaining Regional Control Rooms, to capture emergency calls and dispatch of resources to the incident and staged deployment of a new national Computer Aided Dispatch System.</p>  <p>  A project to enhance network access to rural Garda stations is also currently being progressed. Work on this project is well advanced and options are being explored to provide members attached to the remaining stations not yet networked with local access to Garda ICT services.  In that regard it is important to note that any member attached to a currently unconnected Garda station can access PULSE at their local district station and that members attached to non-networked locations can also contact the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC) or an associated networked station if required.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also, in collaboration with my Department, actively progressing a number of EU ICT projects with a view to improving police co-operation, including implementation of the PR&Uuml;M initiative and the Schengen Information System.</p>  <p>  The ongoing investment in Garda ICT underpinning these and other projects is in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities. </p>  <p>  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies to target, dismantle and disrupt organised criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. It is important to note that Garda&iacute;, supported by the significant resources allocated to it by this Government, have made important progress in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime. The resources available to the Commissioner have reached unprecedented levels and I am pleased that Budget 2019 provides for the continuation of this with an increase of &euro;110 million in the Garda Vote to bring total provision available in 2019 to &euro;1.76 billion which includes up to &euro;95 million for the payment of overtime.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau was established as a national multi-disciplinary agency specialising in targeting of the proceeds of crime. The Bureau draws together the necessary expertise from a number of Departments and agencies. The Bureau has for some considerable time maintained a presence in each of the Garda Divisions through the operation of the Divisional Assets Profiler Programme. Under this Programme asset profilers are providing a criminal asset profiling service across the Garda Divisions in relation to persons or suspects operating within the area, with particular reference to those involved in serious and organised crime. The Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied to it by the asset profilers which enables it to target the proceeds of crime in local communities. I can inform the Deputy that a number of legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of.  </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide significant additional policing hours throughout the country, both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties due to civilianisation of their current roles. These new resources coming on stream have allowed the Commissioner to allocate additional resources to the specialist bureaus that comprise Garda Special Crime Operations including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  The Garda capital allocation has increased from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT which is now an important element of the fight against organised crime.  This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in their daily work in tackling the scourge of organised crime in our communities.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I remain in close contact with the Commissioner to ensure that the necessary resources are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to robustly confront and tackle those involved in organised criminal acts.</p></reply>

I am focused on both supporting and sustaining existing employment levels in regional Ireland while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in every county of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I remain optimistic about the job creation potential of Irish companies across the regions. To date, I have launched eight of the nine Regional Enterprise Plans that my Department has spearheaded with regional stakeholders. The final plan for the South East will be launched on 22 March. These Plans will play an important role in encouraging regional investment and job creation across the regions, including through technology.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that creating jobs in the regions will remain key objective of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and my Department. We are collectively focused on delivering the fairest possible spread of investment across the country. The energy and resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, producing results. We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in the time ahead.</p>  <p>  My Department launched the &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund in June 2018. In December 2018, I was delighted to announce the 27 projects that were approved in principle for funding under the first Call. These projects will receive over &euro;70 million in government funding between now and 2021 and they represent the health, food, ICT and manufacturing sectors in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I would point out that the approved projects involve partners right across the country, showing that excellence in collaborative research, development and innovation transcends county borders and every part of Ireland is capable of participation in one of the most unique Funds Ireland has developed. Specifically, 18 of our successful projects involve enterprise partners based outside the capital and they are located country-wide in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Kildare, Monaghan, Waterford, Louth and Tipperary.</p></reply>

In the year from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018 the figures show that employment continues to grow strongly with 50,500 jobs created, bringing total employment to 2,281,300, the highest number at work ever recorded. </p>  <p>  The number of people in employment has increased in six of the eight regions in the year from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018. The exception to this is the Mid-West and the Border region. </p>  <p>  In the year from Q4 2017 &ndash; Q4 2018, just under half (49 percent) of the new jobs created were for people living outside of Co. Dublin. </p>  <p>  Recently, I announced very good results from the Local Enterprise Offices around the country. Overall, they supported the creation of 3,656 new jobs (net) in 2018.</p>  <p>  All regions saw increases in IDA employment over 2018, with the Midlands region experiencing the highest growth at 14 percent. </p>  <p>  Also, two-thirds (64 percent) of new Enterprise Ireland jobs created in 2018 were outside of Dublin. The North West saw the largest level of increases at 9 percent.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase of 266,900 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015, when the Government first launched the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017 (RAPJ), with 166,400 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in this Q1 2015 to Q4 2018 period.</p>  <p>  In addition, unemployment has fallen in every region since the launch of the RAPJs. Only two regions, the Midlands and South-East, are currently outside the unemployment target set for 2020, i.e. over one percentage point greater than the State average.</p>  <p>  Under the new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 for each of the nine regions, which I am currently launching, the Government remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 per cent in each region by 2020 and to bring and/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.</p>  <p>  The new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, will build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. Shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, the new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and, there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the recently launched Future Jobs Ireland initiative. </p>  <p>  The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential so that all regions can meet and exceed the regional job creation targets set to 2020. These stakeholders include: the Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.</p>  <p>  As well as meeting the numerical targets, the new Regional Enterprise Plans are also about creating jobs that are of good quality and sustainable over the longer term. The Government is focused on this agenda at the national level through the Future Jobs Ireland initiative, and is focused on this agenda through these new Regional Enterprise Plans.</p></reply>

These stakeholders include: Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, the Higher Education Institutes and others.</p>  <p>  Shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, the new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;.  There is a strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the recently launched Future Jobs Ireland strategy. </p>  <p>  They are two-year, focused Plans, which are also &lsquo;live&rsquo; documents, so new initiatives can be adopted during their operation by the regional stakeholders working together.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s results for 2018 show the progress that the Agency have been making in driving enterprise development at a national and regional level.  Client companies assisted by Enterprise Ireland created 18,846 jobs in 2018 and 64% of the jobs created were outside Dublin with all regions recording increases in employment.  There were 215,207 people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies in 2018, the highest total employment in the history of the agency.  Last year, Enterprise Ireland supported 82 high potential start-ups and 50 competitive start fund approvals as well as 245 client investments of over &euro;500k.</p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s results for 2018 demonstrate the progress we have been making in encouraging regional investment. Last year, 56% of all new jobs created by the Agency&rsquo;s overseas clients were in locations outside Dublin. Every region in the country saw FDI-driven job gains. There are now over 132,000 people employed in IDA client firms outside the capital, representing nearly 60% of IDA-supported employment. These are all promising figures and show how real strides have been made in boosting FDI-related job creation across Ireland.  Last year, the Agency delivered 113 regional investments.</p>  <p>  In 2018 clients supported by the Local Enterprise Offices increased employment by 8,007 gross new jobs which resulted in 3,656 net jobs being created across the LEO client portfolio to bring the total number employed to 36,666.</p>  <p>  The LEOs approved grants to 1,259 clients in 2018, with over &euro;18.2m. in funding to projects approved.  Also, in 2018, the LEOs provided training to 34,907 participants. Of these, 3,944 participants took part in the LEO-run &lsquo;Start Your Own Business&rsquo; programmes.  The LEOs have continued to support, build resilience and scale up within their client base.  In 2018, 171 of LEO client companies progressed to Enterprise Ireland along with 796 associated jobs, this is an increase from 60 companies in 2017. </p>  <p>  We will continue to reinforce and strengthen these positive trends and to further job creation and investment across the entirety of the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.658.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200069#WRL04700"><p>The Government, since 2011 has been firmly focused on restoring the economy to a more stable footing and sustaining existing jobs and growing employment in all sectors and in all parts of the country. The economy has recovered strongly and there are now more people at work than any time in the last decade. With the increase in employment and increase in earnings, there is now more spending in the economy and this is to the benefit of all businesses, including hairdressing and personal care sectors. </p>  <p>  The supports of my Department to improve access to credit for businesses are available to businesses in the hairdressing and personal care sectors. These include loans of up to &euro;25,000 available through Micro Finance Ireland, the Credit Guarantee Scheme which is operated with the three pillar banks and also the Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme. I am aware that many businesses may import products for the UK and Brexit may give rise to extra costs. I would also encourage businesses from all sectors to engage with their Local Enterprise Office (LEO), which offer a range of advisory and other supports in every county. In particular at this time of Brexit uncertainty I would encourage personal care businesses to consider participating in the LEO Customs Training programmes if appropriate so they can remain competitive in a post-Brexit environment. Skillnet Ireland and the Education and Training Boards are also engaged with the sector and again I would encourage business owners to engage directly with local providers on their changing skills requirements, in particular where there are requirements for reskilling and upskilling. </p>  <p>  Stabilising the public finances and prudent fiscal management is an essential underpinning for a strong and growing economy and is essential to ensuring future growth prospects for all sectors. The Government&rsquo;s ability to directly fund locally trading businesses is more constrained due to considerations of displacement, fairness and equity between businesses. </p>  <p>  This Government has played its part in supporting the personal care sector when it most needed it with the introduction of the reduced VAT rate in 2011, which helped to sustain employment throughout the country in the sector. </p>  <p>  As the Minister for Finance noted in introducing Budget 2019, while a Government&rsquo;s decision to provide stimulus to the economy is often an easy one to make, judging when it is appropriate to withdraw stimulus measures is always more challenging. The Minister for Finance gave a commitment in the 2018 Finance Bill to undertake an economic analysis of the 9 per cent rate. The review found that the reduced rate has done its job. In the context of the new economic reality where the economy is strong, growth is broadly balanced and full employment is within sight, the Minister noted that it was appropriate to increase the rate of VAT and underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to responsibly manage the public finances and maintain a broad tax base. While it is unfortunate that consumer price inflation in the hairdressing sector as reported by the CSO increased by 4.9% in the year to January 2019, it is to be hoped that this is a once-off increase as the sector adjusts to recent changes for the sector.</p></reply>

It is aimed at supporting collaborative and innovative projects that can help to sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.</p><p>The REDF was designed to support the ambition in the Programme for Government to create an additional 200,000 new jobs by 2020, of which 135,000 are to be located outside of Dublin. One of the principal criteria within the scheme is that proposed projects would strengthen the potential for job creation in their region, thereby contributing to delivering on the Government&rsquo;s ambition.</p><p>The REDF is all about supporting local and regional initiatives that will build on sectoral strengths and help to create jobs across the regions. </p><p>In total, 152 applications were received under the first and second calls of REDF, comprising a total of 75 projects under call 1 and 77 projects under call 2.</p><p>Eligible projects submitted went through a rigorous 7-stage process before being awarded funding. A standard scoring template was used at all stages to ensure consistency of approach.</p><p>As this was a competitive process, not all projects were successful. However, to ensure a balanced regional spread, I committed to ensuring that each region would benefit by at least &euro;2 million from the Fund once the required standard for projects is met under the evaluation criteria. This threshold has now been met across all regions.</p><p>In total, 42 projects have been awarded funding over two completed Calls worth a total of &euro;60m, with projects supported in every region.

In that regard, the Commission proposes legislative and negotiating Proposals which Member States and the European Parliament then consider.  Once concluded, all Trade Agreements are considered by the Member States in Council for formal approval.  In considering Commission Proposals for Negotiating Directives - or Mandates - the Member States take due regard of the overall trade policies of the Union, and the Commission can only commence formal trade negotiations once the Member States have given their approval.  In this regard, both the Commission and the Member States, as well as the European Parliament, would consider how to reflect the latest EU policies on issues such as labour rights, consumer standards, the environment, sustainable development and so on, including, where appropriate, climate change. </p>  <p>  When considering trade discussions with the United States, it is important to record that the European Union and the US have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship and enjoy the most integrated economic relationship in the world.  The EU and the US economies together account for about half the entire world GDP and for nearly a third of world trade flows.  This relationship has proved indispensable not only for the prosperity of both sides of the Atlantic for many years but for many other countries including least developed countries who participate in global supply chains.  Likewise, Ireland and the US have a longstanding bilateral relationship which has proved hugely beneficial in many ways for both our countries.  Taking these factors into account, Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to a continued strong partnership with the US as equal partners.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that Commission President Juncker met with US President Trump in July 2018, in Washington, to launch a new phase in the relationship between the United States and the European Union aimed at de-escalating growing trade tensions, which would impact the jobs of our citizens.  In the Joint Statement the EU and US agreed to dialogue on a range of specific, yet limited, trade matters.</p>  <p>  In September 2018, EU Trade Commissioner Cecelia Malmstr&ouml;m met U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer to initiate the Executive Working Group (EWG), established to improve trade relations between the US and EU.  The EWG has met a number of times since, to discuss the scope of future formal negotiations, most recently in Washington on 6th March 2019.  As part of the Commission's commitment to transparency, an interim progress report was published on 30th January 2019, providing a detailed overview on the state of play of the talks to that date.</p>  <p>  On 18th January 2019 the EU Commission adopted proposals for "Negotiating Directives" - or Mandates - for its proposed trade talks with the United States: one on conformity assessment, (making it easier for companies to prove their products meet technical requirements on both sides of the Atlantic) and one on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods (excluding agricultural products).  The EU Commission published the draft mandates at the same time as submitting them to the EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Subsequently on 19th February 2019 the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade (INTA) endorsed the launch of formal trade negotiations with the United States.  It is anticipated that a further non-binding plenary vote of the European Parliament will take place on the resolution on 14th March 2019.</p>  <p>  If approved by Member States in Council, the finalized mandates would set the parameters for formal negotiations to commence.  However, it is important to note that these two mandates are of a limited scope, covering two distinct areas agreed in the July 2018 Joint Statement.  As I have indicated, they do not constitute a mandate for negotiations on a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, which would involve negotiations across a far wider range of sectors and topics including sustainable development.  Additionally, while these negotiations are proceeding both sides are committed to not introducing new tariff measures.</p>  <p>  The de-escalation in trade tensions between the US and EU achieved by last July's accord has been of benefit to Irish trade interests and jobs.  Equally, a possible future agreement on conformity assessment as well as the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods, would be a positive development to stimulate growth, create employment and continue to grow our economy.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with its EU partners, will determine its final position on the proposed mandates, taking account of issues such as climate and environmental factors and other sustainable development matters and also in the context of our desire for open, free trade and investment flows between Ireland and the US in a rules-based trading system supporting many thousands of jobs. </p>  <p>  Separately, the EU has been negotiating a trade agreement with the four founding members of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) for several years.  If concluded an EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date, four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.  The EU mandate to commence talks was approved in 1999 and aims to eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  Irish exporters are currently subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions, when exporting to Mercosur and the proposed Free Trade Agreement should make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase demand for Irish products.   </p>  <p>  Sectoral opportunities for Ireland in further enhancing a trading relationship with this region include software and services in telecommunications, financial services, digital content and travel, engineering products and services, life sciences, agriculture, food and beverages, and education services.  On the other hand, Ireland like other Member States has strong concerns in relation to agriculture, especially the potential impact that these negotiations present to the EU beef sector.  </p>  <p>  To date, there have been 37 rounds of negotiations and negotiations are still ongoing with the next round planned for the week of 11th &ndash; 15th March in Buenos Aires.</p>  <p>  Both the EU and Mercosur are each committed to implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.</p></reply>

That is why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility. Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs], up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, to support start-ups and growth and, in particular, to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence and find new markets. This new Scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. I announced the first 11 successful applicants on Friday 1st March last and there will be a further call for proposals this year.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018. </p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland has been increased by 18% and they, along with the LEOs, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will be available in early 2019 and it will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This Scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million.</p><p>The first table sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p>The second table sets out the uptake of the different Brexit-related supports available through the Department and its agencies as at 28 February 2019.</p><p>IDA total allocation (current and capital) for 2019 increased by &euro;33.7 million when compared with 2018.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland total allocation (current and capital) for 2019 increased by &euro;6.8 million when compared with 2018.</p><p>LEOs total allocation (current and capital) for 2019 increased by &euro;5 million when compared with 2018.</p><p>ITI total allocation (current and capital) for 2019 increased by &euro;1 million when compared with 2018.</p><p><b>Table 1.</b><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Expenditure/Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td>The scheme will cost the Exchequer &euro;23 million (&euro;14 million provide by Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine).</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td>&euro;258,024 to beginning of March</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new markets</td><td>&euro;362,919 to beginning of March</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td><td>&euro;569,033 to beginning of March</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td>&euro;237,801 to beginning of March</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td>&euro;380,000 to end of January</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td>&euro;1,324,730 to beginning of March</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro &ndash; The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients.</td><td>2017 Expenditure<br /><br />&euro;188,829<br /><br />1 Jan to 30 Sept 2018 Expenditure<br /><br />&euro;365,744</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td>2017 Expenditure<br /><br />&euro;529,922<br /><br />1 Jan to 30 Sept 2018 Expenditure<br /><br />&euro;518,411</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td>There isn&rsquo;t a specific budget allocation for LEO Brexit mentoring.

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. </p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges.

Such a  licence, if granted, enables them to legally prescribe medical cannabis  for a named patient.  It is important to note that the decision to prescribe such treatment is a clinical decision for the prescribing  doctor.</p><p>Until acceptable medical cannabis products are available for use in Ireland, patients who are the subject of a Licence are obtaining their cannabis products from a pharmacy in the Netherlands. </p><p>Under Netherlands government policy, cannabis oil products are not permitted to be commercially exported. </p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that such cannabis products might eventually be listed as products that could be accessed under the Programme, unless the Dutch export barrier is removed, anyone who is prescribed these products will have to travel to the Netherlands to obtain them. </p><p>We are aware that a UK company may provide a service which involves  it collecting cannabis products from the Netherlands for persons  authorised to use it under the UK medical cannabis regime.</p><p>While  this company can import medical cannabis products into the UK from the  Netherlands, the UK authorities do not currently allow re-export from the UK to other countries, which includes Ireland.  </p><p>I have been informed that this UK company may be acting as the patient&rsquo;s &ldquo;nominated  representative&rdquo; in the collection of their personally prescribed medical cannabis products. No similar Irish entity is known to provide this  service, but it is certainly open to any patient to engage a  representative on their behalf in this regard.</p><p>Background information</p><p>1. What is the Cannabis Access Programme?</p><p>(i) The purpose of the Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme is to facilitate access to cannabis-based products or preparations that are of a standardised quality and which meet an acceptable level of quality assurance during the manufacturing process, for three specified medical conditions:</p><p>- Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis;</p><p>- Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;</p><p>- Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>(ii) The Cannabis Access Programme was initiated after the publication of: </p><p>(a) The Health Products Regulatory Authority scientific review. </p><p>(b) Detailed clinical guidelines produced by an Expert Reference Group on medical cannabis. </p><p>Both reports may be found on the Department of Health&rsquo;s web site. </p><p>2. When will the Cannabis Access Programme be introduced?</p><p>(a) Good progress has been made on the introduction of the Cannabis Access Programme. This work is well advanced. It is hoped to introduce the programme in the coming months. </p><p>3. What is a Ministerial Licence for the prescribing of cannabis?</p><p>(a) Pending full operation of the Cannabis Access Programme, clinicians may utilise the Ministerial licensing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients. </p><p>(b) This is provided by Section 14 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. </p><p>(c) Ministerial licences are time limited. The initial licence is valid for a period of 3 months and subsequent licenses in respect of the same patient are valid for 6 months. </p><p>4. Why do patients have to travel to the Netherlands for their medical cannabis products once a ministerial licence has been granted?</p><p>(a) Until suitable medical cannabis products are made available in Ireland under the medical cannabis access programme, prescribers and their patients are sourcing the prescribed products from a pharmacy in The Netherlands, on foot of their medical prescription. </p><p>(b) The Netherland medical cannabis product is sold under the trade name Bedrocan.</p><p>(c) Due to current Netherlands government policy, Bedrocan products, sold as cannabis oil formulations, are not currently permitted to be commercially exported from the Netherlands, but are only supplied in the Netherlands on foot of a valid medical prescription when presented to the appropriate pharmacy.</p><p>(d) This Netherlands pharmacy has confirmed to the Department of Health recently that there are no issues with the supply of THC and CBD products to Irish patients, who are in possession of a valid prescription, and that a three-month supply can be obtained.</p><p>(e) Notwithstanding the fact that Bedrocan products might ultimately be listed as products that could be accessed under the CAP, until the export barrier is removed by the Netherlands government, anyone who is prescribed Bedrocan oils under the Cannabis Access Programme, or a Ministerial Licence will have to travel to the Hague to access it.</p><p>5. Further information</p><p>(a) It is intended that the Ministerial licence application scheme will continue to operate in parallel with the Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, after the programme becomes operational, for exceptional cases, only where there is an unmet clinical need, or the Cannabis Access programme is not suitable for a patient.</p><p>6. Where can information on Cannabis Access Programme and the Ministerial Licence be found?</p><p>(a) The Department of Health website contains detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis and details on how a medical practitioner may apply for a Ministerial licence. This information can be found at: health.gov.ie/blog/publications/cannabis-for-medical-use.</p></reply>

There is limited existing regulation relating to the use of gametes and embryos under SI No. 158 of 2006 (Quality and Safety of Human Tissues and Cells) Regulations, which governs the quality and safety standards in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells, including gametes and embryos.  These regulations empower the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to authorise and monitor tissue establishments, which include some fertility clinics.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types. Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of that Act, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Health, contain provisions relating to the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State, including dealing with the rights of children born as a result of those procedures. It is intended that Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 will be commenced as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  In October 2017, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill on assisted human reproduction (AHR) and associated areas of research, based on the published General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017. The General Scheme encompasses the regulation of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  The process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. As part of this drafting process officials in my Department will ensure that there is coherent interaction between the AHR Bill and Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is ongoing and the Joint Committee intends to report thereon before the summer recess. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The provisions outlined within the Scheme, including the establishment of the AHR Regulatory Authority, will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight. </p>  <p>  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme.</p></reply>

Following the announcement, the Screening Service set out concerns in an email to my Department, which related to uncertainty about costs, volume, impact on turnaround times, impact on perceptions of the programme's accuracy, challenges with processing GP payments, and the potential difficulty in ceasing the arrangements in due course. </p>  <p>  However, as I have previously  stated, the concerns failed to recognise the circumstances of the unfolding crisis in the programme against which such considerations required to be balanced. Were it not for these circumstances, it would never have been necessary to contemplate such a step in the ordinary course of the operation of the screening programme. </p>  <p>  The decision cannot be separated from the reality that general practitioners, in difficult circumstances, were dealing with large numbers of worried patients as a result of the issues which came into the public domain over the course of Thursday and Friday, 26th and 27th of April. It was important that GPs be supported while they awaited supporting information to be developed and disseminated by CervicalCheck. A fee to provide for the free repeat smear, and for a GP consultation, was subsequently agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation, and welcomed by TDs across the D&aacute;il and by GP representative bodies. The alternative, i.e. that the State failed to recognise the reality of patients presenting in this way to GPs or the State refused to pay for such smears, would have been untenable in the circumstances.</p></reply>

The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, it is expected that under 2,100 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p>  <p>  In the context of residents in St Joseph&rsquo;s House, Stillorgan - the Deaf Village Ireland, any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require. </p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.749.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200070#WRM07200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 to 276, inclusive, and 278 to 280, inclusive, together.</p><p>A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rsquo;, the Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP), was launched in September 2016 under the auspices of the Healthy Ireland agenda. </p><p>The OPAP covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. Indeed it must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.</p><p>The OPAP policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017 and a progress report on each recommendation in the OPAP is currently being finalised under the aegis of the OPIOG. </p><p>In the meantime, I am pleased to advise the Deputy of the current position with implementing the Ten Steps Forward as follows:</p><p><i></i>1. Embed multi-sectoral actions on obesity prevention with the support of government departments and public sector agencies</p><p>An Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) has been established under the Chair of the Department of Health. It is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood. The OPIOG held its inaugural meeting in October 2017 with further meetings arranged at agreed intervals for the purposes of providing oversight to the implementation of the national Obesity Policy &amp;amp; Action Plan (OPAP). </p><p>The OPAP recommended that proposals be developed relating to the rollout of evidence based fiscal measures, including a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks, in support of healthy eating. An internal working paper was published by the Department to inform consideration of a sugar sweetened drinks levy from a health perspective. This was entitled Introducing a Tax on Sugar Sweetened Drinks: Health Rationale, Options and Recommendations with a policy objective to reduce rates of childhood and adult obesity in Ireland by reducing the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks (SSDs) as a contributor to health and dental deterioration, particularly among young people. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on 1 May 2018. It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity. The question of considering further fiscal measures similar to the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax is being kept under review by the OPIOG during this early implementation phase of the Sugar Tax.</p><p>On the issue of Step 1 Action 1.4 of the OPAP, the Department of Education and Skills (DES) has advised that in relation to school buildings (primary and post-primary), the Department of Education and Skills (DES) provides tap drinking water system as a matter of routine. In existing buildings if a school has concerns about the quality of its drinking water, the matter can be addressed by the relevant local authority and Irish Water. If any quality issues are identified as a result of a test, the DES provides funding to address the issue. If a school does not have a tap drinking water supply, the DES will provide funding to address this.</p><p><i></i>2. Regulate for a healthier environment</p><p>The development of legislation for calorie posting to support people to make healthy choices is underway by the Department of Health. A behaviour study on how best to make the posting of calories meaningful to customers and more likely to impact on their behaviours has been published by the ESRI. </p><p>A number of Government policies aim to support the design and development of built environments that enhance health, wellbeing and quality of life for all. The National Physical Activity Plan (NPAP) and OPAP both require that joint action is taken to promote the importance of physical activity and to reduce the obesogenic nature of the built environment.</p><p>In line with Actions 31 of the NPAP and 2.1 of the OPAP, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity, and Action 59 of the NPAP which commits to developing a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement, a Stakeholder Forum was held on 21 November last. </p><p>The event was planned in partnership, with substantial input from three Government Departments, (Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Housing, Planning and Local Government). Work will progress in 2019 taking account of the outcomes of the forum's discussions.</p><p>3. Secure appropriate support from the commercial sector to play its part in obesity prevention</p><p>At its inaugural meeting, the OPIOG agreed to establish two sub-groups for Reformulation and Healthy Eating. Both sub-groups have met on a number of occasions since being established and agreed their Terms of Reference.</p><p>The Reformulation sub-group is technical in its work programme. The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures.</p><p>One of the priority actions under Step 3 of the OPAP was to &lsquo;Establish a forum for meaningful engagement with industry on best practice initiatives towards a healthy food environment&rsquo;. It is intended to progress this action under the auspices of the OPIOG. And in this regard, workshops between the Reformulation sub-group of the OPIOG and Food Sector Stakeholders on reformulation took place last September and again in February this year. These workshops provided an opportunity for detailed engagement with key Food Sector Stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of reformulation in the interest of promoting the health and wellbeing of the population.</p><p>A code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship has also been developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments. It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland, and published in 2018. Work on the implementation of the Codes of Practice is continuing.</p><p><i></i>4. Implement a strategic and sustained communications strategy that empowers individuals, communities and service providers to become obesity aware and equipped to change, with a particular focus on families with children in the early years</p><p>The Healthy Ireland 2018 communications and citizen engagement campaign sought to encourage people to make small, healthy changes under the themes of Healthy Eating, Physical Activity and Mental Wellbeing, and to link them with partner organisations and initiatives providing information and support. This campaign will continue in 2019.</p><p>In addition, under Healthy Ireland, the Department, <i>safe </i>food and the HSE run a campaign called START which  aims to inspire, empower and support parents to start building and persist with healthy lifestyle habits in the family to prevent childhood obesity.  </p><p><i></i>5. The Department of Health, through Healthy Ireland, will provide leadership, engage and co-ordinate multi-sectoral action and implement best practice in the governance of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan</p><p>As referred to at step 1 above, an Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group was established to oversee implementation. New Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources have already been published, disseminated and communicated in 2017, including dissemination of the new Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools. </p><p>Work has also commenced on developing Healthy Eating Guidelines for the 1-5 year old age group. As a first step in this work, the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is currently developing scientific recommendations for food based dietary guidelines for 1 to 5 year olds.</p><p>New Nutrition Standards for schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, have also been developed. These Nutrition Standards were published in September 2017. The Nutrition Standards were developed by the Department of Health with the assistance of <i>safe</i>food and the Health Service Executive, in cooperation with the members of the School Meals Programme in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p><i></i>6. Mobilise the health services to better prevent and address overweight and obesity through effective community-based health promotion programmes, training and skills development and through enhanced systems for detection and referrals of overweight and obese patients at primary care level</p><p>A Healthy Eating, Active Living Programme has been established as a Policy Priority Programme within the HSE and a three-year plan for the programme has been finalised. The GP contract for the provision of free care to children under 6 years, already provides that the medical practitioner shall take an active approach toward promoting health and preventing disease through the provision of periodic assessments to child patients. </p><p>The HSE is also implementing a Breastfeeding Action Plan and a new Making Every Contact Count brief intervention framework which aims to capitalise on the opportunities that occur every day within the health service to support people to make healthy lifestyle choices.</p><p>On the issue of nutrition in hospitals, the HSE, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Healthy Ireland, is to roll out a new Food, Nutrition and Hydration Policy for patients in acute hospitals in the coming months. A team working at national level, composed of all relevant staff including catering, (managers and chefs), dietitians, management, medical, nursing , occupational therapy and speech and language have worked together to develop the policy. Support and guidance to aid implementation of the policy will be provided in an accompanying toolkit. The policy and toolkit are due for publication and implementation in the near future. </p><p><i></i>7. Develop a service model for specialist care for children and adults</p><p>A National Clinical Lead for Obesity was appointed in 2017. This appointment is important in further advancing the implementation of many of the recommendations in the OPAP including the development of a national integrated service model for the health and social care of overweight and obese people and for developing quality assurance guidance for obesity services. </p><p>8. Acknowledge the key role of physical activity in the prevention of overweight and obesity </p><p>'Get Ireland Active! The National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland' (NPAP) is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that Plan is well underway in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders. An updated progress report on the implementation of the NPAP will be published in Q1 2019.</p><p><i></i>9. Allocate resources according to need, in particular to those population groups most in need of support in the prevention and management of obesity, with particular emphasis on families and children during the first 1,000 days of life</p><p>The implementation of the Healthy Eating and Active Living Plan within the HSE is supporting work in the education sector, as well as with parents, families and communities in delivering a more co-ordinated approach to prevention and early intervention in child obesity.</p><p>In addition, the Healthy Ireland fund was established in 2017 with an allocation of &euro;5 million and with additional allocations of &euro;5 million in 2018 and 2019.  The first round of the Fund was distributed through Local Community Development Committees, Children and Young Person&rsquo;s Services Committees and statutory organisations.  The aim of the Fund is to support innovative, cross sectoral, evidence-based projects, programmes and initiatives that support the implementation of key national policies in areas such as Obesity, Smoking Alcohol, Physical Activity and Sexual Health.</p><p>The Fund has been effective at targeting population groups that experience health inequalities.  In Round 1 (2017/18), there was a focus on specific groups experiencing health inequalities, including people living in areas of social disadvantage (71% of actions), people with disabilities (45%), people from new communities including refugees and asylum seekers (39%) and members of the Traveller community (36%).  Furthermore, of the local actions that were implemented in Round 1, 61% related to physical activity and 32% were related to food, nutrition and weight management.  Round 2 of the Fund is currently being implemented.</p><p>10. Develop a multi-annual research programme that is closely allied to policy actions, invest in surveillance and evaluate progress on an annual basis. </p><p>The development of an annual bulletin or score card to evaluate progress in relation to the national Obesity Plan and dissemination of results, has also been initiated. Finally, a progress report on implementation of the OPAP is currently being finalised under the aegis of the OPIOG.</p><p>Finally, there are a number of relevant commitments in the First 5 whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families, which will be taken forward by the relevant Departments, agencies and other partners.</p></reply>

The purpose of the surveys was to measure employee sentiment and engagement within the publicly funded Health Sector.  </p>  <p>  As with all surveys, it raised a number of both positive and negative results.  These results have prompted the National Ambulance Service to take a range of measures to address the areas where improvements could be made.  </p>  <p>  I am clear that bullying or harassment in any workplace must not be tolerated and any such instance must be addressed in accordance with the appropriate grievance and disciplinary policies and procedures.  Any employee who experiences or witnesses work place bullying or harassment should be aware that they can report these instances under the Dignity at Work Policy for the Health Service.</p>  <p>  The NAS is also developing anti bullying work place initiatives in line with the Positive Workplace Programme and bespoke sessions for the NAS are currently in development.  Staff Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing initiatives and programmes are ongoing in the NAS as part of Healthy Ireland including significant focus on staff health initiatives such as mental wellbeing, physical activity, health checks and improving the workplace environment.</p>  <p>  There are a number of other ongoing programmes and initiatives being undertaken and supported by the National Ambulance Service.  For example, a number of NAS managers across the country have undertaken Leadership Development Programmes including Continuous Quality Improvement courses using the Lean Sigma process.</p>  <p>  The NAS has also established a National Staff Engagement Forum as well as local Engagement Networks.  The role of the Forum is to create a space for conversations about what matters to staff in terms of engagement and to gather suggestions on how to improve it by building on existing approaches and continually looking for new ways to engage staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NAS has strengthened representative bodies and increased the number of NAS staff representation in order to provide further regular and scheduled discussion around areas such as improvement in internal and upward communication, raising awareness around dignity at work issues, and health and wellbeing initiatives.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the burden that this places on them and their families.  </p><p>The long-term strategy to develop sustainable scoliosis services from 2018 and into 2019 is a priority for me and for the HSE.  Children's Health Ireland (CHI) advises that the impact of investment, and the implementation of the Scoliosis 10 Point Action Plan, is now starting to deliver results with a consistent reduction in waiting times being recorded. </p><p>Children's Health Ireland (CHI) also advises that the total number of surgeries performed in 2018 was 418 compared with 371 in 2017. This represents an increase in activity of 12% against 2017 and an increase in activity of almost 87% compared to 2016 when 224 procedures were carried out. </p><p>Furthermore, the number of patients on the waiting list for scoliosis related surgeries as of 01 March 2019 is 158, of which 87 are waiting for spinal fusion (see table). This is a reduction of 22 or 12% since Jan 2018</p><p>Since the beginning of 2018, there has been a 51% reduction in the number of children waiting over 4 months for surgery (from 74 at the start of 2018 to 36 as of 01 March 2019).  </p><p>In addition, CHI advises that an additional 60 posts have been approved for 2018 and 2019, and in this context, it  is currently recruiting two additional general orthopaedic consultants which will further reduce waiting times for children for an orthopaedic outpatient appointment.  </p><p>More broadly, all patient referrals to the orthopaedic spinal service at CHI are reviewed and clinically prioritised by a consultant. These patients are seen in order of clinical priority. Most patients are seen within 12 months.</p><p>An additional 800 OPD appointments were given to patients in CHI at Crumlin in 2018 compared to 2017 which led to a 31% reduction in the overall orthopaedic outpatient waiting list. </p><p>Finally, the CHI will continue to work to reduce waiting times for children and young people attending orthopaedic and scoliosis services.</p><p>The following document provides details of the number of scoliosis surgeries performed to date this year along with the number of patients on waiting lists clinically deemed as requiring surgery as at 01 March 2019. </p><p><b><i>Total surgeries (inc. single &amp;amp; multiple stages) performed as of 1 March 2019</i></b><table><tr><th>Week ending 01/03/2019</th><th>CHI at Crumlin</th><th>CHI at Temple Street</th><th>Cappagh Hospital</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Number of Spinal Fusion YTD</td><td>18</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Other Spinal Procedures YTD</td><td>18</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>36</td><td>13</td><td>10</td><td>59</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Total No. of patients on waiting lists clinically deemed as requiring surgery as of 1 March 2019</i></b></p><p><i>Number of patients on waiting list waiting for scoliosis related surgeries.

This was the culmination of the work of the National Steering Group established in 2017, and I thank them for their work.  The Steering Group included representation from stakeholder groups including the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  The ultimate goal is to put in place a national framework of acute, in-patient and community based specialist rehabilitation services.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive provides specialist services for people with a variety of disabilities, including those with Acquired Brain Injury, either directly or through service agreements with appropriate organisations.  I am familiar with the cards that the deputy is referring to.  Brain Injury Identity cards are a means for people with an Acquired Brain Injury to communicate; the cards are intended to inform others, so that they can better assist the person as they go about their daily lives.</p>  <p>  Any decision to introduce Brain Injury Identity Cards would be a matter for the HSE to consider in the context of the Neuro-Rehabilitation Implementation framework and the actions arising from it.</p></reply>

The reply did not use the word &ldquo;align&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  While both the CAP and the Ministerial licence route might run in parallel initially, it is possible that some of the patients currently using the Ministerial licence route might be subsumed into the CAP, should their treating clinician decide to change their current prescribed cannabis medication to a product that will be provided under the CAP. It may not be possible for all the current Ministerial licence holders to transfer immediately into the CAP, however this will be based on a clinical decision.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that over a period, a variety of medical cannabis products, both THC and CBD and manufactured by multiple producers, would be available for use in the CAP.</p>  <p>  Travel to The Hague to obtain Bedrocan medical cannabis product after the CAP is introduced may be a necessity for some licence holders and their patients. Due to current Netherlands government policy, Bedrocan products as oil formulations are not permitted to be commercially exported from the Netherlands, but are only supplied in The Hague on foot of a valid medical prescription to the appropriate pharmacy. Notwithstanding the fact that Bedrocan products might ultimately be listed as products that could be accessed under the CAP, until the export barrier is removed by the Netherlands government, anyone who is prescribed Bedrocan oils under the CAP, will have to travel to the Hague to access it. </p>  <p>   It is open to any patient to discuss their current prescribed medication with their clinician, and consider whether it might be possible to change it to a product that will be provided under the CAP.  To reiterate, this is a clinical decision and as Minister for Health I have no role to play in it.        </p>  <p>  The Department of Health website contains detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis and details on how a medical practitioner may apply for a Ministerial licence. This information can be found at: health.gov.ie/blog/publications/cannabis-for-medical-use.</p>  <p>  With reference to the fact that in the UK a distribution company is being used to get Bedrocan medication delivered to patients in the UK. I understand that this company is acting as the patient&rsquo;s &ldquo;nominated representative&rdquo; in the collection of medical cannabis products. No similar Irish entity is known to the Department to provide this service, but it is certainly open to licence holders to engage someone to carry out a collection service.</p>  <p>  Finally, I understand that the Transvaal pharmacy in the Hague has confirmed to the Department of Health that there are no supply issues with THC and CBD Bedrocan products to patients and that a three-month supply can be obtained.</p></reply>

The Agency&rsquo;s role includes monitoring and inspecting medicinal products on the market to ensure their safety, efficacy and legality. The HPRA also leads the co-ordination of efforts by national agencies and stakeholders to manage medicine shortages.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the supplier of this product has confirmed that there is currently no shortage of Risperdal&reg; 2mg tablets (which contains the active ingredient risperidone) in Ireland. </p>  <p>  However, the HPRA was made aware of a shortage of another medicine containing risperidone 4mg from a different supplier in February. This may have resulted in an increased demand for risperidone 4mg and 2mg tablets from other suppliers. However, there have been no reports of shortages of any other medicine containing risperidone. That said, some localised issues may arise for a period of time as stock levels return to normal throughout the system.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, medicines shortages do arise from time to time for a number of different reasons and are a feature of health systems around the world. The shortage of the risperidone 4mg product was not as a result of Brexit. I can confirm that no shortages currently affecting the Irish market are attributable to Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The Government does not anticipate an immediate impact on medicine supplies should there be a no deal Brexit on 29 March. There are already additional stocks of medicines built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow fast-tracking of essential medicines into Ireland, will help deal with any delays that may arise.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no need for any patient to order extra quantities of medicines or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions, as this could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.</p>  <p>  Risperdal&reg;, and other medicines containing the active ingredient risperidone, have been designated as interchangeable by the HPRA. Interchangeable medicines contain the same active ingredient, in the same strength, and therefore other brands containing risperidone may be safely switched to if necessary. If a patient has any concerns regarding their treatment with this or any other medicine, I would encourage them to discuss this directly with their doctor or pharmacist.</p></reply>

The PNA do not have negotiating rights for ambulance personnel.  </p>  <p>  The HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of SIPTU, FORSA and UNITE.  This is not a legal right but a concession granted to recognised unions. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that the PNA has taken this action, it is not possible to negotiate with a union which is not recognised as having negotiating rights for ambulance grades.  In saying that, I am keen to see an end to this dispute.  Officials from my Department have met with representatives of the HSE and the management of NAS to explore possible options.  This is a complex, challenging situation however, I remain confident that a solution can and will be found.  </p></reply>

It has a statutory role in protecting the public by promoting the highest professional standards among medical practitioners practising in the Republic of Ireland.  It is responsible for setting the standards of medical education and training in Ireland and it maintains a register of all doctors who are legally permitted to practise in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 (MPA) is the legislation governing the Council&rsquo;s work and determines the Divisions of the Register and the terms and conditions for registration of doctors on the Register.  Section 7 of the MPA sets out the functions of the Council, one of which is to establish procedures and criteria for registration including the issue of certificates of registration and renewal of registration. </p>  <p>  In order for a medical practitioner to practice medicine in Ireland they must be registered with the Council.  </p>  <p>  All EEA nationals can avail of the recognition of professional qualifications laid down in Directive 2005/36/EC which enables the free movement of professionals and sets the rules for automatic recognition for professions with harmonised minimum training conditions such as doctors. The Medical Practitioners Act also provides for the registration of a medical practitioner who is a national of a Member State who has been awarded a qualification in medicine or a certificate of acquired rights by a competent body or authority designated for that purpose by a Member State, pursuant to Directive 2005/36/EC.</p>  <p>  All doctors who graduate from non-EU/EEA countries may be required to sit the Council&rsquo;s Pre-Registration Examination System (PRES).  The purpose of the PRES is to assess a doctors&rsquo; competence in two areas; Clinical Knowledge and Clinical Skills.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the Council made the PRES easier for applicants outside of Europe to apply for registration.  Instead of having to pass the PRES Level 2 exam, applicants were required to provide evidence as part of their initial application for registration that they had passed an acceptable equivalent exam.  The Council accepted 4 alternative examinations in lieu of the Level 2:</p>  <p>  Professional and Linguistic - Assessment Board (PLAB), Part 1</p>  <p>  - United States Medical - Licencing Exam (USMLE), Steps 1 and 2</p>  <p>  - Medical Council of Canada - Evaluating Examination (MCCEE)</p>  <p>  - Australian Medical Council - (AMC) MCQ Exam</p>  <p>  Applicants applying with a pass in one of these examinations could directly access the PRES Level 3 (OSCE) exam.  </p>  <p>  The PRES Level 3 is an assessment of doctors&rsquo; clinical skills, knowledge and attitude in the main clinical disciplines of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, Medicine and General Practice. The Level 3 is also based on the Eight Domains of Good Professional Practice as devised by the Council. It is assessed through an Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) and a written &lsquo;Data Interpretation&rsquo; paper, which is a one-hour long test involving interpretation of laboratory results, X-Ray images, ECG&rsquo;s etc. </p>  <p>  There are three types of skills being assessed namely Practical, Communication and Interpretation. The cases that are used represent the kinds of patients and medical conditions normally encountered during medical practice in Ireland and are specifically designed to demonstrate, through the process of examining a candidate&rsquo;s practical, communication, and interpretation skills, the examinee's clinical ability.</p>  <p>  The pass mark for this exam is standard set using the &lsquo;modified Angoff&rsquo; method for the data paper and &lsquo;borderline regression&rsquo; for the OSCE. Candidates are expected to meet a level equivalent to an Irish graduate at end of intern year.</p></reply>

The responses to that consultation and other possible policy levers are being considered by my Department with a view to developing a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy which will require the involvement of stakeholders from across the health service. I expect that my Department will make progress in this regard in 2019.</p><p>At an operational level, the HSE's Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme has a biosimilar strategy in place since 2017 which is making considerable progress using a collaborative approach with hospital pharmacists and clinical teams to bring about changes in prescribing practice. In that respect, hospitals are working towards a targeted minimum prescribing rate for biosimilars of 50%.</p><p>The HSE is also working on identifying barriers to the prescribing of biosimilars with a specific focus on education and support.  It is seeking to increase understanding of biosimilars through targeted presentations to clinicians and hospitals. </p><p>The culmination of these initiatives is a greater uptake in the usage of biosimilars and this is evident by hospital dispensing data.  For example, the prescribing rate for the biosimilar drug Infliximab has increased from 5% in 2017 to 40% in 2018.</p><p>My Department proposes to build on these positive developments and to bring forward a policy that would support and complement the many initiatives which are already underway.</p></reply>

RHSR sets out the Government&rsquo;s health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland up to 2025.

Its remit is to give leadership, direction, prioritisation and mobilisation of resources to support the implementation of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  The progress report will be reviewed on an ongoing basis during 2019 by a standing sub-committee. Progress will be further reported through Cabinet Committee B, chaired by An Taoiseach and the associated senior officials group.</p>  <p>  Next year will see the launch of a mid-term evaluation of the Strategy. This will allow all stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on progress on implementing the Strategy and to identify what new actions may be required for period up to 2025.</p></reply>

To this end, it is a welcome regulation, providing harmonisation across EU member states and protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of our populations. GDPR came into effect in May 2018, having provided all data controllers with a two-year lead-in phase to review processes and procedures of data protection. </p>  <p>  The GDPR is not the first time that principles and requirements were set out for data protection in Ireland.  There has been data protection legislation since 1988.  In the previous legislation, informed consent was a key requirement for the processing of data for research purposes whereas in GDPR it is called explicit consent - the only difference in interpretation being that GDPR stresses that explicit consent must be clear and unambiguous and that a researcher must be able to provide evidence of the consent secured should they be asked to present it.</p>  <p>  While both the GDPR and Ireland's subsequent Data Protection Act 2018 mentioned health research, both had a broader remit and specific regulations were required to provide clarity for health researchers. The Data Protection Act 2018 (Section 36(2)) (Health Research) Regulations 2018 sought to provide safeguards for Article 9(2) of GDPR, providing certainty to the health research community with regard to processing of special categories of personal data and the necessity of obtaining explicit consent from individuals for their inclusion in health research. As such, the Health Research Regulations (HRR) provide a framework for current practices in this country that are standard, or at least are expected to be standard, and as such should not be onerous on the research community. </p>  <p>  However, in highlighting that explicit consent should continue to be sought and secured for the purposes of processing personal data for health research purposes, the Department was very aware that there are situations which arise where securing consent is either impossible or impracticable for various reasons. Therefore, the HRR importantly contains an innovation in Irish law (the establishment of the Health Research Consent Declaration Committee- HRCDC) to directly address these situations where consent for a health research project is of significant public importance but where it is not possible to obtain consent. This is a major development that will certainly benefit those carrying out important health research who could not secure explicit consent, and it will provide them with a mechanism to put forward their proposal and to secure a lawful decision from the Committee.</p>  <p>  Far from seeking to make Ireland a restrictive place to do research, the Minister and the Department of Health have repeatedly publicly stated the importance of health research to better patient care and treatment, the development of innovative and life-saving therapies and at a wider economic level to bringing in foreign investment and creating high skilled jobs. Ireland has a vibrant and growing research community, supported by significant investment by the Department of Health, and there are high levels of public support for, and trust in, health research conducted in Ireland.  The purpose of the HRR is namely to promote the conduct of health research in Ireland aligned with best international practice, while at the same time maintaining and promoting public confidence in health research.</p>  <p>  The long-term success of health research in any democratic society requires public confidence.  Without that confidence, the necessary support for health research, especially in evolving and complex areas such as genomics or artificial intelligence, will not be forthcoming.  Above all, the purpose of the HRR is, therefore, to promote the long-term success of health research in Ireland by ensuring that individual patients and the public generally can have confidence in how their sensitive health information is being used.</p></reply>

Under this new Regulatory framework, Ireland submitted a six-year Statement of Strategy for the implementation of the School Scheme in Ireland covering the period 1 August 2017 -31 July 2023.  As regards the School Milk Scheme, my Department as the Competent Authority stated its key objective was to halt the decline in the participation in the School Milk Scheme in Ireland. Participation had decreased over 50% in the eight school years preceding the 2017/18 school year.</p>  <p>  The research identified a number of reasons for the decrease in participation levels, including:  increase in water consumption (31%); price perceived as too expensive (15%);  parental contribution required for non-DEIS schools (15%); children do not consume milk at home (23%).  The research also highlighted some issues regarding facilities and equipment, including the frequency of delivery, particularly in rural areas, and the quality of milk where deliveries of milk are made outside the school grounds in the early hours of the morning.</p>  <p>  Following the research, my Department has undertaken a number of actions to deliver an improved School Milk Scheme in the current school year i.e. the 2018/19 school year, including:</p>  <p>  - Targeted recruitment campaign in advance of the commencement of the new school year by the National Dairy Council (NDC)  (Sept 18).</p>  <p>  - Enhanced accompanying measures/educational resources in the form of a new School Milk Week delivered (February 2019), with associated publicity campaigns and competitions to raise awareness.</p>  <p>  - Increasing the parental subsidy by 60% (Sept 18) to make the scheme more affordable for parents.</p>  <p>  - Trialling of a new method of delivery of milk to schools.</p>  <p>  - The NDC is addressing the issue of frequency of deliveries in contracts with individual suppliers. </p>  <p>  I would anticipate that, as a direct consequence of these additional measures, the numbers of participating schools and the volume of milk distributed in the school year 2019/2020 will increase compared to school year 2018/2019. However, final figures will not be available until the end of 2019. </p></reply>

Before this year, my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture and stocking density. </p><p>From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p><p>- Low temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope</p><p>This process has now been completed and details in relation to the outcome have been published following a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders.  </p><p>In summary, the vast majority of land that was eligible under the existing Scheme will remain eligible under the new approach and over 2,000 townlands will now be eligible under the new approach and will be eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019.  Some  700 townlands that would have previously been eligible are not eligible  under the new designation.  Farmers impacted financially by this change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and  2020.  </p><p>Farmers who hold land in townlands that are no longer eligible in 2019 have been written to, and included in this letter, is an application form to begin the process of an appeal should they wish to take up this option.  This form is also available on the Department's website.  </p><p>I have put an independent appeals process  in place for any farmer who wishes to appeal the status of a particular townland following this process.

The tribunal ruled that ANSES (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety) should have given more weight to potential safety risks when initially authorising the use of &ldquo;Roundup Pro 360&rdquo;.  However, all other products containing glyphosate continue to be unaffected by the ruling and consequently the official register of approvals in France contains over 60 glyphosate containing products.  This particular trade name, &ldquo;Roundup Pro 360&rdquo; has never been placed on the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Regulatory decisions on the approval and use of pesticides are based on the scientific consensus view of all the relevant technical information from all sources. Regarding the use of plant protection products containing glyphosate in Ireland, I continue to be guided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), who have both concluded, on the basis of extensive reviews involving public consultation, that glyphosate can be used safely without putting consumers or users at risk. This process guided the decision to renew the authorisation of Glyphosate within the European Union in 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor international peer-reviewed scientific evidence and the guidance provided by EFSA and ECHA. </p></reply>

I have demonstrated my commitment to the industry by increasing the budget allocated to Horse Sport Ireland from &euro;2.0m in 2017 to &euro;2.5m in 2018 and I have approved a further increase of &euro;500,000 to &euro;3.0m in 2019.  This is an increase of 50% on the 2017 allocation.</p>  <p>  In 2016 my Department commissioned Indecon International Consultants to undertake a review of Horse Sport Ireland.  Indecon found that additional resources will be needed to support the expansion of the sector and reports like the strategy report from The Sport Horse Alliance make this point clearly.</p>  <p>  Horse Sport Ireland have been making huge strides in implementing the Indecon recommendations.  The proposal to rationalise the board is close to finality with only the Northern representative outstanding.  A recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service was undertaken to select a new chairperson and three board members.  These members are now in place alongside the four industry representatives.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to the sport horse industry and I am confident that this additional Government support will help the sector increase its economic and social contribution into the future.</p></reply>

They do not provide data to the Department and there is therefore no central database maintained within my Department.  However, all of these companies provide details of the chips they hold to Euro Pet Net which is a group of national and local associations based across Europe which register owner information about pets that have been uniquely identified.  This directs Dog Wardens or other such persons who have scanned a dog to the appropriate database to identify the dog owner.</p>  <p>  While the microchips themselves are of a standard numeric and technological format across Europe, the dog microchipping system in Northern Ireland operates on a quite distinct basis. The UK has approximately thirteen databases operating and does not currently require registration with a centralised clearing house such as Euro Pet Net to identify which database holds a particular dogs information.

In 2017 I visited Mexico, the fourth largest importer of chilled and frozen pork in the world, to establish market access. Following visits from Mexican authorities, six export plants were recently audited as part of the first stage of gaining access to that market for Irish exporters.</p>  <p>  There has also been a substantial expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat exports to Asia, with exports to China, Japan and South Korea topping &euro;100m last year. In May 2018, I led a trade mission to China, which included events, in association with Bord Bia, to promote Irish pork and develop export opportunities. I also travelled to Japan and South Korea in 2017 to expand opportunities for Irish exporters in these markets. </p>  <p>  Exports to Japan increased by 36% to &euro;30m last year and exports to South Korea increased by 29% to reach &euro;11m. Additionally, I led the first ever Irish agri-food trade mission to Malaysia last November, where a veterinary health certificate for pigmeat was agreed, a vital milestone in the process of gaining market access. I will continue to work closely with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, capitalise upon opportunities for Irish pig meat exporters on international markets.  </p>  <p>  As regards support for primary producers, TAMS II measures (under the 2014-2020 RDP plan) provide grants for capital investment in physical assets to assist pig producers to develop their businesses. In 2016, I established a Pig Implementation Strategy Group to oversee implementation of the report of the Pig Industry Stakeholder Group. This group plays a vital facilitating role in achieving the objectives for the industry as laid out in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  The possibility of a disorderly Brexit poses a threat to the entire agri-food sector, including the pigmeat sector.  I have stressed in discussions with Commissioner Hogan that there will be a need to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the sector, including via traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan has reiterated the EU&rsquo;s willingness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as a clearer picture emerges. </p></reply>

Currently, under the most popular planting category, the premium rate is &euro;520 per hectare for planting areas greater than 10 hectares. The grants and premiums available under the programme  represent a considerable investment by the National Exchequer in afforestation and the 15 year rule will remain in place for the current Programme, as per State Aid approval.</p>  <p>  While the Forestry Programme does not cover the cost of reforestation, forest owners can realise their asset through clear-felling, when their forest matures. It should be noted that  since 1/1/2016 changes to taxation rules means that income from felling is no longer subject to the High Earners Income Tax restriction which limited the exemption to &euro;80,000 per annum. Furthermore, under paragraph (591) of the European Union Guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas 2014 to 2020, State aid is not allowed for reforestation grants where felled trees are replaced with equivalent ones.  </p>  <p>  As payment for reforestation is not provided for under the current Forestry Programme, no further premiums are paid once the 15 year period has elapsed.</p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.  I continue to prioritise efforts to gain access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for live exports. </p>  <p>  I visited Turkey last week to meet with my Turkish counterpart, Dr Bekir Pakdemirli, Minister for Agriculture and Forestry.  We discussed existing and future opportunities for technical cooperation and trade in agri-food products between Ireland and Turkey.  I impressed upon Minister Pakdemirli the importance of the Turkish market for Irish livestock and our desire to re-establish trade as soon as possible.  I am pleased that the Minister indicated his intention to consider the re-opening of the market in the second half of 2019 and I assured him that there is significant interest from industry in this country in resuming that trade.</p>  <p>  The stringent system of animal health and welfare controls operated by my Department on the sea journey to Turkey ensures that Irish cattle arrive in excellent condition, a point acknowledged by the Turkish delegation. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging closely with Egypt to reach agreement on health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle.  The Chief Veterinary Officer has written to his Egyptian counterpart on 4th March in this regard.  </p>  <p>  In November 2018, the Department reached agreement with Libya on a new veterinary health certificate for the export of breeding cattle, and an amended veterinary certificate for the export of fattening and slaughter cattle.  Having an agreed health cert for breeding cattle provides much more clarity for exporters, as previously exports of breeding cattle to Libya had to be agreed on a load-by-load basis.  The age of cattle that can be exported to Libya increased from 24 to 30 months &ndash; this increases opportunities for exporters to export a wider range of cattle.  Live exports to Libya more than doubled in 2018 over 2017 to 5,450 head.  There was a recent shipment of 1,000 bulls to Libya.  </p>  <p>  In January I also extended an invitation to my Algerian counterpart to visit Ireland in early 2019. This follows earlier contact with Algeria, in an effort to reach agreement on revised and separate slaughter, fattening and breeding certificates.</p></reply>

It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p><p>This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p><p>The loans will be competitively priced at 4.5% or lower, will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. There is a minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 for SMEs or &euro;50,000 for primary agriculture. The maximum loan amount is &euro;3,000,000 and loans of under &euro;500,000 will be made on an unsecured basis.</p><p>There will be &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million available initially for farmers, within an overall agri-food package of &euro;120 million. Should demand exceed these levels, this can be reviewed. </p><p>The Scheme features a two-stage application process whereby initial application is made through the SBCI website. Successful applicants are issued an eligibility reference number which can then be used in an application to one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.  Further information including a FAQ document may be accessed on the DAFM website via the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>SBCI recently issued an open call inviting banks and other lenders to become lending partners and this closed on 11 February. SBCI advise that that a period of due diligence, which will include the EIF, is now under way.  I have urged SBCI to operationalise the Scheme as soon as possible. The Scheme will run for three years from its launch date and further announcements in this regard will be made shortly.</p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.  I continue to prioritise efforts to gain access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for live exports. </p><p>My decision in 2017 to reduce the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime.  Since then there has been continued growth in the export of calves, rising from 102,000 in 2017 to 159,000 in 2018.  It should be noted that the reduction of live exports in Northern Ireland over the last decade is linked to the demands by the UK multiples under the beef labelling rules.</p><p>In 2018 live exports of cattle increased by over 30% to 246,000 head compared to 2017.

The All of Government Plan will build on the previous actions and framework put in place by both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that the new plan will include a series of actions aimed at further developing our analytical understanding of the socio-economic and distributional impacts of the low-carbon transition, ensuring that we design policies and measures to address both the challenges and the opportunities arising, and putting in place appropriate frameworks to support regions that are expected to be particularly impacted by the transition. This includes work to analyse the economic and employment implications of the transition to be completed by the end of 2019, in line with the timeframe committed to in the National Mitigation Plan.</p>  <p>  The publication of the Government's Future Jobs Ireland on 10 March also reflects the importance of a just transition for Ireland and sets out a series of complementary actions, including commissioning the National Economic and Social Council to develop policy recommendations for consideration by Government for the operation of Transition Teams to manage the impact of economic transition on vulnerable workers and sectors. These may comprise: developmental supports for enterprises and sectors faced with challenges arising from the move to a low carbon economy; sustainable business models and new technologies; career advice and training guidance to managers and workers in sectors and job roles affected by future changes; accessible training to upskill and retrain such workers including through Skills to Advance as well as tailored development plans for them; and potential EU financial assistance opportunities for such a programme.  </p></reply>

While such emissions are not currently accounted for in relation to the calculation of compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets in the period to 2020, from 2021 onwards these emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets. It is, therefore, essential that Ireland has robust policies in place to manage emissions and enhance removals from relevant LULUCF sectoral categories.</p>  <p>  Hedgerows are an important feature of the Irish pastoral landscape and can play a potential role in carbon sequestration. The latest estimates suggest that the hedgerow length in Ireland is over 600,000km. On the basis of the information available at the moment, hedgerows could potentially sequester somewhere in the region of 0.1 Mt carbon dioxide to 0.5 Mt carbon dioxide. In order to refine the figures to allow for inclusion in the National GHG Inventory, further remote sensing investigations would be required to create a national detailed inventory of hedgerows. Further hedgerow surveys would also be required to refine classifications and identify appropriate sites. Proposals for research along these lines are under consideration in the Environmental Protection Agency in the context of its 2019 research call.</p>  <p>  I am currently preparing an All of Government Climate Plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. I am working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives in electricity, transport and heat, as well as a range of other sectors. I intend that the Plan will also include actions to develop and implement policies to manage emissions and enhance removals from relevant LULUCF sectoral categories. </p></reply>

The Group's work is ongoing and it is scheduled to report to me at the end of this month.  </p>  <p>  As I noted in the Dail last week, EU state aid rules prohibit the setting up of the sort of fund envisaged by the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI). However, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill includes proposed amendments to Sections 33 and 123 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 to allow the Broadcasting Authority (BAI) to be allocated public funding from TV Licence fee receipts towards meeting its operating expenses. It is intended that the consequent reductions in levy contributions, up to a maximum of 50% would be applied 'across the board' so that all broadcasters would benefit in equal proportion from the measure. Drafting is at an advanced stage by Parliamentary Counsel and I intend to publish the Bill in quarter 2 this year. </p>  <p>  The independent radio sector already benefits from the BAI Sound and Vision Scheme which is funded from 7% of the net TV Licence fee receipts. The Scheme provided over &euro;494,000 towards 77 different radio projects for broadcast on independent commercial stations in 2018.</p></reply>

Charging at home at night is the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way to charge an electric vehicle. Given the high proportion of homes with driveways and dedicated parking spaces, Ireland has greater capacity for home charging than many other countries. A Government funded grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers. </p><p>There are currently 668 standard public charge points as a part of the ESB eCars Network and circa 80 fast chargers, mainly on national routes to facilitate longer journeys. In addition, there are a number of location/destination charging points located at hotels, shopping centres, visitor attractions, places of employment, private car parks etc. </p><p>Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. The project successfully completed the assessment stage and is now going through the validation stage. On completion of this stage further detail on the project, including information in relation to the location of chargers and an implementation timeline, will be set out. </p><p>The key elements of the project include:</p><p>- Six high speed charging hubs on motorways capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously</p><p>- 16 high speed charging hubs capable of charging four vehicles simultaneously</p><p>- Additional high power chargers at 34 current fast charger locations</p><p>- Upgrading 50 standard chargers to fast chargers</p><p>- Replacing up to 264 standard chargers (totalling 528 charge points) to next generation high reliability models</p><p>At the end of 2017, there were 3,799 electric vehicles (including battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) on the road in Ireland.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.  </p>  <p>  Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high speed broadband in Laois has increased by 1,934. Today in total, the number of premises in Laois with access to high speed broadband is 24,415, 62% of total premises in the County. Another 2,066 will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment.</p>  <p>  The remaining 12,772 homes, schools and businesses in Laois will be connected under the National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan.

In that response, I explained that the establishment of air transport connections are the result of commercial agreements between airlines and airports and that as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have no function in these commercial decisions. </p>  <p>  Engagement between my Department and aviation stakeholders has continued in the months since the Deputy raised this matter previously, and my officials and I have continued to reiterate the importance of the aviation industry, including airports, taking steps to prepare and where possible to reduce their exposure and to limit reliance on any one particular destination or service.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the European Commission last year put forward a draft legislative proposal aimed at ensuring basic air connectivity in a no deal scenario. The measures proposed will, subject to reciprocity, provide a large degree of certainty to the Irish aviation sector and to the travelling public. The situation was further clarified on 7 March, when the United Kingdom confirmed its intention to reciprocate the proposed measures. While this cannot mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario,  or the assurances contained in the negotiated Withdrawal Agreement, the fears that aircraft might not be able to fly are being addressed. </p>  <p>  Government also supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services more generally through funding from Tourism Ireland for cooperative marketing activity. Cooperative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination more widely. An increased budget allocation in Tourism Ireland for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I would encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services, including Shannon Airport with regard to alternative European hub connections.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it has not been possible to allocate the full amount sought to every applicant.  </p>  <p>  As part of the 2018 SCP, 431 applicants that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the Programme were invited to submit corrected documentation to allow their applications to be considered for funding.  186 organisations took up this offer and 170 (91%) were ultimately awarded grants including the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  As the application in question was a resubmitted 2017 application, the same methodology for assessment and allocating grant amounts was used as for the original 2017 applications.  The full scoring system and assessment procedure in this regard is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. All applications were assessed according to the published criteria including the likelihood of increasing participation, whether the proposed facilities were being shared, the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area of the project (based on the Pobal index of deprivation) and the level of SCP funding previously allocated.</p>  <p>  The overall score at assessment stage, the amount of funding sought and the amount available for that county (on a per capita basis) were the key determinants of individual grant awards. </p>  <p>  Full details of the scoring obtained under the various criteria were provided to all successful applicants including the organisation referred to by the Deputy when the letter of provisional allocation issued. With regard to the possibility of providing any additional funding, it is of course open to the organisation to make a further application when the next round of the SCP is open for applications.</p></reply>

The Parliament's proposed amendment was to include the alignment of Derry - Sligo - Galway on the North Sea - Mediterranean Core Network Corridor. This amendment was deemed unacceptable by the European Commission on the grounds that alignments of the core network corridors can only include elements of the core TEN-T network, which as presently defined does not include any of Derry, Sligo or Galway.

These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January.  </p>  <p>  Work is now underway in assessing the new 2018 requests and I can confirm that an application has been submitted by the organisation referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  For the first time, applicants who have submitted incorrect documentation under this round will be given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it may be the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.</p></reply>

This &lsquo;type-approval&rsquo; system is regularly updated to account for improvements in safety standards and to allow advanced safety features to become mandatory requirements.

While there are no certainties in predicting future technologies, the full electrification of the national car fleet represents a feasible option.  Indications from car manufacturers and energy market analysts suggest that mass market adoption of EVs is probable. </p><p>Accordingly, Ireland's National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland: 2017-2030set an ambitious target that from 2030, all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero emission capable. In addition, Ireland has a national target of 20,000 EVs on Irish roads by 2020 and an ambitious longer term target of 500,000 by 2030.</p><p>In order to expedite the deployment of low carbon technologies, especially the uptake of EVs, my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment jointly convened an interdepartmental Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce. The Taskforce includes representatives from across the public sector and has consulted widely with industry, stakeholders and representative groups. Phase one of their Work Programme focused exclusively on EVs and their recommendations were considered ahead of Budgets 2018 and 2019. A suite of continued and new EV supports has subsequently been established (see below) and a Progress Report has been published on my website (available at this .)</p><p>There has been a substantial recent increase in EV sales; in 2018, a total of 1,972 new EVs were registered, bringing the total number on Irish roads to almost 7,650 by the end of December. 2019 is seeing a continued rise in EV numbers - in the first month of the year 1,112 EVs were registered compared to 213 in January 2018. By the end of February, there were almost 9,500 EVs under taxation.</p><p>Suite of EV supports currently available: </p><p>Purchase Grant Scheme - A grant of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new BEV or PHEV</p><p>VRT Relief - VRT Relief of up to &euro;5,000 for BEVs (until end 2021), up to &euro;2,500 for PHEVs (until end 2019) and up to &euro;1,500 for conventional hybrids</p><p>Domestic Charger Grant - A grant of up to &euro;600 towards the installation cost of a domestic charge point for new and second-hand BEVs or PHEVs</p><p>Low Motor Tax - BEVs qualify for the lowest tax band of motor tax at &euro;120 per annum, while a PHEV is typically taxed at circa &euro;170 per annum</p><p>Toll Incentive Scheme - As of July 2018, BEVs and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles</p><p>Lower fuel and maintenance costs - Studies show that you can save circa 70% annually on fuel costs in comparison with a diesel alternative</p><p>Comprehensive public and on-street charging network - ESB e-Cars rolled out and are further investing to enhance a network of EV charging points throughout Ireland, including almost 80 fast chargers.

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. The largest programme, both in terms of public funding and children registered, is the Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) programme. </p>  <p>  The ECCE scheme is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Pobal conducts unannounced compliance visits to participating service providers. The purpose of compliance visits is to assess whether a service is operating the ECCE programme in accordance with both the &lsquo;ECCE Funding Agreement&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, the most recent of which was published on 9th   August 2018. </p>  <p>  Over the course of a compliance visit Pobal will typically check all of the schemes operated by a service against the corresponding rules. Rules are designed to not only protect public money but also to ensure that certain quality and operational standards are met by the service provider. This is vital in order to make sure that the goals of the ELC schemes, funded by my Department, are being met.</p>  <p>  In relation to attendance records, this requirement is not just a means of safeguarding public money; it is also an issue of child safety and a requirement of the statutory regulator, Tusla's Early Years Inspectorate. </p>  <p>  The number of children participating in ECCE, the number of services providing ECCE, and the number of compliance visits varies from each programme cycle. Each year the Department agrees a new compliance service offer with Pobal. While the specifics may change each year, the underlying principle of the compliance approach remains to effectively address risk, ensure the ELC schemes are operating as intended and provide assurance that the significant public investment in ELC is being protected.  </p>  <p>  In each programme cycle since 2015, the approach, coverage and categories of compliance have changed to some extent. </p>  <p>  Prior to 2017/2018, major non-compliance referred to any breach of specific programme rules, such as incorrect PIP registrations. Previously, any incorrect PIP registrations would result in a finding of major non-compliance. This was revised in 2017/2018 to ensure that major non-compliance referred to cases where a breach of the rules resulted in a significant risk to exchequer finances. For example, a small number of incorrect PIP registrations will now result in a finding of moderate non-compliance, while a large number of incorrect registrations will result in a finding of major non-compliance. This change ensures that the finding of major non-compliance is now a more accurate and proportionate categorisation. </p>  <p>   As a consequence, it is important to note that the compliance outcomes are not directly comparable with the previous programme cycles. </p>  <p>  In the 2015/16 programme cycle there were 4,178 ECCE contracts. Pobal reviewed 2,075 of these representing 49.66% of all ECCE contracts. In the 2015/16 programme cycle Pobal found that 38% of all contracts reviewed were recorded as major non-compliant with ECCE programme rules. However, only 2% of ECCE contracts were found to be major non-compliant in relation to attendance records. </p>  <p>  In the 2016/17 programme cycle Pobal reviewed 1,644 ECCE contracts out of 4,260, representing 38.59% coverage of all ECCE contracts. 45% of ECCE contracts reviewed were found to be major non-compliant in the 2016/17 programme cycle. 10% of ECCE contracts were found to be major non-compliant in relation to attendance records.</p>  <p>  In the 2017/18 programme cycle Pobal reviewed 1,598 ECCE contracts out of a total of 4,246. This represented 37.64% coverage of ECCE contracts. The level of major non-compliance fell to just 7% of ECCE contracts reviewed ( note the statement above re the re-categorisation at the beginning of this year). </p>  <p>  Further, in 2017/18, only 2% of ECCE contracts reviewed were found to be major non-compliant for not delivering sufficient free access to ECCE. This shows that 98% of services are meeting the core goal of ECCE; to provide access to 3 free hours per day of ELC to children. This represents a positive outcome for ECCE which will continue to run in parallel with National Childcare Scheme (NCS) into future programme years.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to provide the attendance records for children registered in the ECCE programme and my Department does not routinely collect such records from services. During a compliance visit, Pobal reviews attendance records on site but may also take copies and remove the records from the premises if necessary.  </p>  <p>  In summary, it is a key priority of my Department to ensure that providers fully comply with all programme rules in an effort to ensure the programmes are operating as intended and to safeguard public funds. </p>  <p>  One of the most significant developments in the childcare area in recent years will be the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) later this year. The NCS is a legislatively based ELC scheme, that will provide great opportunities to children, families and service providers. Building on existing schemes,  the NCS will contain rules that will be child-centred, fair and proportionate, clear and consistent.  They will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  They will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.1615.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200084#WRAA04600"><p>Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so therefore an allowance was made. Their ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted.  It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place.</p>  <p>  This Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly. The child in question has utilised their full allocation of two years of the ECCE programme. </p>  <p>  It should be highlighted that the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) is a two year pre-school programme. There is no routine provision for a third year which may not be in the best interests of a child and could have the capacity to lead to breaching the statutory school starting age.</p>  <p>  In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have mistakenly assumed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented a derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years.</p>  <p>  The application process for an exemption from the upper age limit for the ECCE programme was introduced within a context where: </p>  <p>  - The ECCE programme was for a year only; and </p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusions Model (AIM) did not exist.</p>  <p>  Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016/2017, the further extension of the programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, the rationale underpinning the policy intent of the system of overage exemption came under review as the initial premise for the provision of an exemption might have been considered to be no longer valid, i.e. an overage exemption as originally designed allowed for a child to avail of one programme year of ECCE over two years, whereas the standard provision is now a full two programme years. </p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and report by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child and research shows broad agreement that it is in the best interest of the child to start school with their peers.</p>  <p>  As regards the specific case you have raised, I would stress that each application for an exemption is considered on its own merits and never in the context of the outcome of any other case. In this instance, the application was declined on the basis that the full ECCE entitlement had already been availed of.</p>  <p>  I regret if this process and decision has caused any upset to the parents involved, but I can only seek to assure you that the decision was taken with due regard for the best interests of the child, especially as it relates to research showing broad agreement that it is in the best interest of the child to start school with their peers. We will be happy to assist the family, if requested, to make contact with the NCSE to ensure that adequate preparations are in place for the child to start school in September 2019. The family should make immediate contact with their local school to make sure it has appropriate arrangements in place to support the child from September 2019.</p></reply>

All young people and young adults in the service who are entitled to Aftercare services have an allocated Aftercare Worker.</p><p>Young people in the IRPP were brought in under the following programmes:</p><p>Calais Special Project (41)</p><p>EU Relocation Programme (6) </p><p>Malta Programme (4)  </p><p>Tusla is currently engaged in a further mission to Malta, to carry out interviews with the young people with a view to relocating a further 5 unaccompanied minors to Ireland this year.</p><p>My colleague Minister Flanagan has written to Greek authorities to inform them of our intention to accept an additional 36 separated children seeking asylum from the refugee camps in Greece, under the IRPP programme.  Tusla has begun to liaise with the agencies responsible for unaccompanied children in Greece, with the support of the IRPP and the Irish Embassy in Athens, for the identification and nomination of unaccompanied children who fit the profile for relocation to Ireland. </p><p>I would note that there has been a existing service for separated children seeking asylum for a number of years.  Capacity to meet commitments of Government has been put in place. </p><p>A tendering process took place in 2017 to award private providers a contract for three 6-bed residential centres. The same tendering process allows for provision of further  residential places, if needed, where the provider would be asked to provide one 6-bed centre.However, in 2017 two of Tusla&rsquo;s statutory children&rsquo;s residential centre&rsquo;s changed their purpose and function to become centres for separated children seeking asylum.  In total these two centres are providing 9 placements and no additional places have been sourced to date under the new contract.</p></reply>

In addition to this Tusla maintains a refuge facility in South Dublin which has been temporarily closed for essential refurbishment works. This facility is expected to re-open as a domestic violence refuge in Quarter 2 of this year. In total, 155 family units of emergency accommodation are provided - 145 in emergency refuges and 10 in emergency non-refuge accommodation. </p><p>Table 1 sets out the location and capacity of emergency refuge and emergency non-refuge accommodation throughout the country. </p><p>Tusla receives activity data from service providers retrospectively on an annual basis.

A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged up to 18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.</p>  <p>  Foster care allowances are payable for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the social worker must show that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  In general terms, disability services are provided by the HSE, and the eligibility of children, including children with a disability, to relevant supports and services is determined on the basis of clinical need. </p>  <p>  Tusla and my Department are aware that children in care with a disability may face specific challenges. The Joint Protocol for Interagency Collaboration between the Health Service Executive and Tusla, agreed by the two agencies, is designed to address such matters.</p>  <p>  This protocol clarifies how children in care access HSE-funded disability-related services, setting out the respective roles and duties of the relevant agencies, as well as the arrangements in place when children in care reach 18 years of age. While the Protocol is managed at a local level in the first instance, it provides a clear escalation process should an issue arise, or if there is an unresolved matter around access to appropriate services.</p>  <p>  The Protocol&rsquo;s development came on foot of intensive and productive engagement at the highest level between the HSE, Tusla, my Department, and the Department of Health. My officials are continuing to work closely with Department of Health colleagues regarding young people in care transitioning to HSE Disability Services placements upon turning 18, in order to effect a sustainable transition mechanism.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.1668.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200085#WRBB03100"><p>Assisting families to access high quality, affordable early learning and care and school age childcare is a priority for me as Minister and hence I take any concerns raised by the sector very seriously. </p><p>My Department funds a number of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes.  Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs believes that our approach to compliance and  supporting services  strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended. </p><p>A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the <i>&lsquo;</i>Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, the most recent of which was published on 9 August 2018. Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible.  </p><p>I very much appreciate that community childcare settings provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules.  </p><p>My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.  </p><p>Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that investment in  childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four  budgets, now totalling  &euro;575 million per year. Community services access much  of this growing investment. Turnover for many services has increased  quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has  increased only slightly) and co-payments / top-up payments made by  parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to  strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet  compliance requirements.  </p><p>The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the National Childcare Scheme. In launching this new scheme today with the Taoiseach, we began a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it. The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended.  </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s policy relating to the new National Childcare Scheme (NCS) was informed by evidence and with the best interests of children and families in mind. The legislation that I brought forward, supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.</p><p>Under NCS, subsidies will be paid to a service provider for a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances. At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade, This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I published last November. </p></reply>

Such responsible dog ownership is the key to reducing incidences of sheep worrying and other problem behaviours. </p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs Acts 1986, as amended, set out a range of requirements for all dog owners or any other person in charge of a dog. In particular, section 9 of the 1986 Act outlines requirements regarding keeping dogs under effectual control. Section 9 (2) states that the owner or any other person in charge of a dog that worries livestock is guilty of an offence, while Section 21 of the 1986 Act provides that the owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for an attack on livestock. </p>  <p>  Upon seizure of a dog under Sections 9 or 11 of the Control of Dogs Act, the seized dog is taken to the Local Authority dog pound, with relevant details regarding the dog entered in the register. Section 14(3) specifies the information to be entered in the register while Section 11 outlines the duration of detention of the dog. </p>  <p>  As all operational matters in relation to the Control of Dogs Acts 1986, as amended, are matters for local authorities, an out of hours dog warden service is solely a matter for the relevant local authority.  I understand that Louth County Council dog warden service has been very active in addressing all aspects of sheep worrying, from dealing with actual cases, including the scanning of dead dogs for microchips at the scenes to preventive measures such as seizing stray dogs from the area. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with all responsible stakeholders and support any practical reciprocal arrangements between local authority areas, and where relevant, other jurisdictions. In many cases these arrangements can be dealt with at an operational level by local authorities. My Department will work with all responsible stakeholders towards the shared aim of promoting responsible dog ownership and consistently reinforcing the message that dogs should never be allowed to roam alone. </p></reply>

The remaining &euro;30 million is available for schemes which will be overseen at a national level. </p><p>Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No. 1303/2013 stipulates that support can be provided for the administration costs of the LAGs and the cost of their engagement with communities to generate projects - also referred to as &quot;animation&quot; costs.</p><p>In line with the Regulation, the maximum percentage of funding that can be spent by Local Action Groups on administration and animation is 25% of the LEADER expenditure incurred in the delivery of their Local Development Strategy (LDS). </p><p>25 of the 29 LAGs delivering LEADER are Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) working in partnership with the Local Development Companies and Local Authorities in their respective areas. In these LAGs, the funding for administration and animation expenditure is all provided to the Local Development Companies or it can be shared between both the Local Development Companies and the Local Authorities. </p><p>The division of the administration and animation funding between the Local Authorities and the Local Development Companies is a matter for each individual LAG.  My Department understands, based on submissions from the Local Authorities, that the percentage funding retained by each Local Authority for their own administration purposes related to the LEADER programme ranges from 0% to 5% of the LAG budget. </p><p>In the other 4 cases, the Local Action Groups are Local Development Companies that are not in a formal partnership with the LCDC and Local Authority. Therefore the full 25% funding for adminstration and animation is available solely for the Local Development Company.</p><p>Table 1 outlines the following details for each LAG: </p><p>- The total allocation for the LEADER 2014-2020 programme; </p><p>- The total planned administration and animation expenditure as outlined in each Local Development Strategy; </p><p>- The total planned administration and animation expenditure as outlined in each Local Development Strategy expressed as a percentage of the total allocation; </p><p>- The percentage of the total allocation retained by Local Authorities for administration and animation costs. It should be noted that this percentage is already included in the overall percentage provide in the table for Administration &amp;amp; Animation, and is not an additional allocation. </p><p>The LAGs may also be entitled to additional administration and animation expenditure associated with projects approved from the &euro;30 million available at national level.</p><p>This expenditure is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.</p><p><b>Table 1: LEADER 2014:2020 LAG allocations and associated administration and animation expenditure </b><table><tr><th><div>Local Action Group</div></th><th><div>Total Allocation</div></th><th><div>Planned Administration and Animation (A&amp;amp;A) Expenditure</div></th><th><div>A&amp;amp;A as % of Total Allocation</div></th><th><div>% of Total Allocation to be Retained by  Local Authority</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;6,416,803.43</td><td>&euro;1,604,202.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;8,522,285.84</td><td>&euro;2,080,571.00</td><td>24.4%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;8,920,224.65</td><td>&euro;2,229,225.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   North</td><td>&euro;5,091,845.73</td><td>&euro;1,272,961.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   South</td><td>&euro;3,831,303.31</td><td>&euro;957,825.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   West</td><td>&euro;5,015,674.19</td><td>&euro;1,253,918.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;12,913,877.86</td><td>&euro;3,228,467.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin   Rural</td><td>&euro;6,370,438.43</td><td>&euro;1,592,609.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>1.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Galway   East</td><td>&euro;7,655,850.61</td><td>&euro;1,768,369.00</td><td>23.1%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Galway   West</td><td>&euro;4,540,033.00</td><td>&euro;1,089,608.00</td><td>24.0%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>&euro;10,219,868.29</td><td>&euro;2,554,967.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;5,261,600.01</td><td>&euro;1,315,400.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>2.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>&euro;7,791,572.91</td><td>&euro;1,947,893.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>&euro;7,124,586.86</td><td>&euro;1,774,629.00</td><td>24.9%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>&euro;5,998,474.74</td><td>&euro;1,475,686.00</td><td>24.6%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>&euro;9,276,593.96</td><td>&euro;2,319,232.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;7,597,623.07</td><td>&euro;1,869,123.00</td><td>24.6%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;6,101,862.01</td><td>&euro;1,525,465.50</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>&euro;11,121,431.88</td><td>&euro;2,753,549.00</td><td>24.8%</td><td>3.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>&euro;6,903,123.57</td><td>&euro;1,725,781.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>&euro;7,592,719.51</td><td>&euro;1,839,923.00</td><td>24.2%</td><td>2.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro;8,036,763.90</td><td>&euro;2,006,737.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro;8,852,659.22</td><td>&euro;2,213,164.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;7,655,647.81</td><td>&euro;1,913,912.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;10,103,443.28</td><td>&euro;2,520,859.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>1.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>&euro;7,522,796.18</td><td>&euro;1,880,699.00</td><td>25.0%</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>&euro;7,384,206.22</td><td>&euro;1,795,210.00</td><td>24.3%</td><td>1.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>&euro;9,840,140.56</td><td>&euro;2,260,036.00</td><td>23.0%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;6,336,549.00</td><td>&euro;1,556,965.00</td><td>24.6%</td><td>0%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Funding can be provided under a broad range of defined themes, which include enterprise development and social inclusion.  </p><p>The Social Inclusion theme of the LEADER Programme focuses on the provision of services for people living in rural and remote areas and, in that context, support for the services referred to by the Deputy could potentially be considered eligible for LEADER funding.  </p><p>In order for a project to be eligible for funding under LEADER, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy in the LEADER sub-regional area concerned, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme.</p><p>The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the Local Action Groups (LAGs) which administer the programme in each LEADER area.  Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partners to discuss the funding that may be available. Contact details for all LAGs are available on my Department's website at<i>. </i></p><p>The Community Enhancement Programme provides capital grants to community groups to help them to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. The details of the 2019 programme are currently being finalised by the Department and I anticipate that the programme will be launched in the coming weeks. Applications should be made to the Local Community Development Committee in the relevant area.</p><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme has, in the past, provided funding for the items referred to by the Deputy, to established organisations that operate on a voluntary basis and are involved in emergency rescue or first response efforts in the community.  CL&Aacute;R operates in specific designated rural areas that have experienced high levels of depopulation.  </p><p>I launched the 2019 CL&Aacute;R programme on 28 February last.

These Acts provide for the setting of a national minimum wage (NMW) and also provide that in specified circumstances, such as younger workers and trainees, a reduced, sub-minimum rate may be applied.</p><p>In September 2015, the then Minister requested the Low Pay Commission to examine the appropriateness of the sub-minimum rates as provided for in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 with regard, in particular, to their impact on youth unemployment rates and participation in education. </p><p>The Commission undertook a consultation process on this subject in line with its evidence based approach to making recommendations to Government and received 15 submissions in total. The Commission's final report was published on 20 February 2018.</p><p>Having examined all available evidence and submissions, and considered a range of options, the Commission recommended the abolition of training rates.  The Commission had heard evidence in submissions of the training rates being paid in order to reduce wage costs rather than as part of a structured training programme.  The Commission found that the lack of clear definitions around training rates left them open to abuse. In light of these considerations and the low usage of the training rates the Commission was of the view that training rates should be abolished.  The Commission encouraged sectors to register for state approved apprenticeship programmes, which are under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills, if they felt that a period of structured training was required. </p><p>In its report the Commission also recommended simplifying the rates of minimum wage for those aged under 18 to 20 as follows: </p><p>- Employees under 18 would receive a minimum of 70% of the NMW </p><p>- Employees aged 18 would receive a minimum of 80% of the NMW  </p><p>- Employees aged 19 would receive a minimum of 90% of the NMW </p><p>- Employees aged 20 and over would receive the full NMW. </p><p>These recommendations were accepted by Government and the amendments to make the necessary legislative changes to the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 were implemented via the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018.  The changes came into effect on 4 March 2019.  </p><p>The Low Pay Commission is an independent authoritative body on matters relating to the national minimum wage and I am confident that the Commission gave consideration to the impact of any recommendations it made in regard to training rates.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.1703.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200086#WRCC00900"><p>I want to assure the Deputy that the IORP II Directive will be transposed into Irish law in accordance with the Government Decision of 9 January 2019.  Government approved the approach of applying the requirements of the Directive to all funded occupational pension schemes to enhance pension scheme governance and the consumer protection of pensioners, members and future members.  Responsibility for the transposition of the Directive lies with my Department.  </p>  <p>  The over-arching objective of IORP II Directive is to facilitate the development of occupational retirement savings in the EU.  The transposition of the Directive will result in significant improvements to the regulation of funded occupational pension schemes in Ireland.  Transposition will raise governance standards, improve trustee qualification and suitability, and increase supervision through enhanced powers for the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  It had been suggested that single person pension schemes should be exempt from the application of IORP II rules on the basis that the scheme members are competent in the management of their own affairs and that the governance requirements are unduly onerous.  However, the value of investments held in many schemes fell substantially during the financial crisis.  This highlighted the need for stricter supervision and regulation of schemes, especially for small schemes investing in unregulated markets.  Money saved for pension purposes should be properly protected to ensure that people have adequate income for their retirement years.</p>  <p>  Pension policy comes within my remit and in carrying out this role I consult with the Minister for Finance on various matters.  Given that the State incentivises and supports pension savings through tax relief, my officials consulted with Department of Finance officials on this transposition, where the merit of the principle of improved regulation and consumer protection for pension savers as provided for in the IORP II Directive was agreed. </p>  <p>  The application of the Directive is prospective, not retrospective.  This means that existing investments and borrowings can remain in place.  After transposition all single member schemes, including Small Self-Administered Schemes, who are the only schemes currently allowed to borrow, will not be allowed to enter into new borrowing arrangements, except for short term and liquidity purposes.  All of their future investments will have to be made in accordance with the investment rules in the Directive.</p>  <p>  Transposition of the Directive is also a key part of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023.  The Roadmap was launched by the Government in February 2018 and details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, are managing the transposition process for this Directive.  This is a substantial Directive and preparation of regulations to transpose it is at an advanced stage.  Codes of practice will also be issued by the Pensions Authority.  Furthermore, to ensure that trustees of schemes are informed of their obligations under the Directive, the Authority will also undertake a communication campaign on the implementation of the Directive.  The emphasis of this engagement will be on providing sufficient support, time and information in order for industry and trustees to plan for and make the changes needed.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of the Directive is to protect workers' health and safety by ensuring that working hours meet minimum standards applicable throughout the EU.</p><p>The original Directive 93/104 was transposed into Irish legislation by the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  The 2003 Directive made some changes in respect of a number of categories of work including doctors in training, mobile transport, offshore work, and workers on board seagoing fishing vessels.  These were transposed by sectoral regulations as follows: </p><p>- European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, </p><p>- Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Transport Activities) Regulations 2004, </p><p>- Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Offshore Work) Regulations 2004, </p><p>- European Communities (Workers on Board Sea-going Fishing Vessels) (Organisation of Working Time) Regulations 2003.</p><p>Questions of interpretation are a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission, which adjudicates on complaints under the Organisation of Working Time Act and has an enforcement role in terms of its application.  The Labour Court hears cases on appeal from a Workplace Relations Commission adjudicator's decision, and decisions of the Labour Court in such appeals can be enforced by the District Court.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible. </p><p>Accordingly, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. </p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30.0 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.</p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 1 January 2018 &ndash;

It is means tested and is paid only to customers who are getting a qualifying payment, either a State Pension or a means-assessed payment.  The rate of fuel allowance is &euro;22.50 per week or &euro;630.00 annually.  Currently the fuel season is 28 weeks, and the allowance can be paid weekly or in two lump sums of &euro;315 each, being at the start of the fuel season in October and at the midway point in January.</p><p>I understand that the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) Winter Fuel Payment (WFP) is an annual tax-free payment made to eligible people to help towards their winter heating costs.  It is a lump sum payment between &pound;100 stg and &pound;300 stg and in most cases it is paid automatically between November and December, to qualified persons.  I also understand that as of winter 2012/13, people who live in the EEA or Switzerland<b></b>who have &ldquo;a genuine and sufficient link&rdquo; to the UK are potentially eligible to receive the WFP, regardless of whether they previously had entitlement to it whilst living in the UK. This change occurred, following the 2011 European Court of Justice ruling (the &lsquo;Stewart Case&rsquo;).  Prior to that, only people who had an entitlement to WFP before moving from the United Kingdom were eligible.</p><p>Post-Brexit, including in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Irish and British citizens will continue to enjoy the right to travel, live, and work between the UK and Ireland in the same manner as before. This is because of a long-standing arrangement known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).</p><p>Under the CTA, Irish and British citizens can move freely and reside in either jurisdiction and enjoy associated rights and entitlements, including access to employment, healthcare, education, social benefits, and the right to vote in certain elections.  The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on it. Both the Government of Ireland and the UK Government have committed to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances. </p><p>As part of that commitment, the Government has entered into a Convention on Social Security with the Government of the United Kingdom replicates the current arrangements that apply to the coordination of social security benefits between the two jurisdictions post-Brexit.  There is no provision in the Convention which will change the existing practices in relation to fuel or other payments. Existing arrangements will continue.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p><p>In recent years entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme.  In the 2017/2018 academic year there were 1,214 schools benefitting from the scheme; 367 of these schools do not have DEIS status.  </p><p>Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary with the onus being on the individual eligible schools to make an application.  Schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of the school year.  Funding is based on a rate of payment per meal, per child, per day.  The maximum rates of payment and examples of food to be provided are contained in the following tabular statement.</p><p>Nutrition Standards for School Meals were published in September 2017 under the auspices of Healthy Ireland, Safefood and the HSE.  The Standards are mandatory from the 2018/2019 funding year and organisations will be required to provide evidence of full compliance with them as part of the application and inspection processes. </p><p>As part of Budget 2019, it was announced that DEASP would commence a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing Hot School Meals in 36 schools for an estimated 7,200 children at a cost of &euro;1 million for 2019 and &euro;2.5 million in a full year.  The premise of the pilot is to take account of the fact that the majority of schools don't have kitchen/canteen facilities and that the food be prepared off-site in such instances.  Issues relating to capital expenditure within schools is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.  The focus on the pilot will be on primary schools and currently there are no plans to extend it to youth services, early years settings and after-school programmes.  </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position.  </p><p><b>Tabular Statement - School Meals Food Clubs Rates of Payment</b><table><tr><th><div>Meal </div></th><th><div>Max Rate of Payment (per child per day) </div></th><th><div>Minimum number of food items </div></th><th><div>Examples  f Food to be Provided </div></th></tr><tr><td>Breakfast/Snack</td><td>&euro;0.60</td><td>2 items</td><td>1 serving of wholemeal/wholegrain cereal or bread PLUS 1 serving of fruit OR 1 serving of milk, yogurt or cheese</td></tr><tr><td>Lunch</td><td>&euro;1.40</td><td>1 substantial item + 1 small item + a drink</td><td>Wholemeal/wholegrain  sandwich or roll containing 1 serving meat, poultry, egg or cheese and 1 serving salad PLUS 1 serving fruit PLUS a drink (e.g. water, milk, unsweetened juice)</td></tr><tr><td>Dinner</td><td>&euro;1.90</td><td>Hot meal + drink</td><td>1 serving  meat, poultry, egg, beans PLUS 1 serving potatoes, pasta or rice PLUS 2   servings vegetables/fruit PLUS a drink (Milk, Water, Unsweetened Juice)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

According to section 161A(a) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended), a person shall be entitled to BP where the person has attained the age of 18 years but has not attained pensionable age.  The payment is made up of a personal rate and extra amounts for a qualified adult and any child dependents.  </p>  <p>  The payment is administered by my Department, which contacts all BP recipients three months in advance of their 66th birthday in order to inform them that their BP payment will cease and invite them to apply for either the means-tested State Pension Non Contributory (SPNC) or the State Pension Contributory (SPC). </p>  <p>  BP claimants would be expected to be financially better off on SPC or SPNC when 66 years or over as the weekly rate of pension is higher than for BP.  As SPC is not a means-tested payment, a person can receive payment of SPC and continue to work or have other income.  For those who wish to engage in work or self-employment, the earnings disregard for SPNC is also higher at &euro;200 per week for both the claimant and their spouse.</p>  <p>  On SPNC the first &euro;30 of calculated means is disregarded whereas the first &euro;7.60 is disregarded on BP.  </p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of the SPC or SPNC may also qualify for half rate Carer's Allowance.</p>  <p>  Therefore in no case would it be expected that a claimant over 66 years of age would be financially better off on BP than on SPNC or on SPC.  Any changes to the eligibility criteria for BP would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. </p></reply>

The first increase to 67 years of age will be in 2021 and the second to 68 years of age in 2028.  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by roughly &euro;1 billion every 5 years.</p>  <p>  There is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. </p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years.  Any person who retires before reaching State pension age may apply for either jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB), a social insurance contribution based income support or means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA), subject to them satisfying the rules of the schemes. Recipients may continue to get a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment if they find part-time or casual work but they must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7. </p>  <p>  JB is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age (66 years) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions. </p>  <p>  The jobseekers schemes are kept under review and any further changes, including entitlement beyond the 66th year, will be considered by Government having regard to the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements at that time. </p></reply>

If a customer is unable to visit the Drogheda office, arrangements are made to conduct a home visit.</p>  <p>  The current service is operating well. Customers from Dunleer have access to a service in Drogheda throughout the week and are not confined to a half-day clinic once a week.

In the case of people already in part-time employment, this may focus on options or opportunities in their current job to increase their level of employment. Alternatively, this could also entail looking at possibilities in other areas, which may require some training but could provide a more sustainable income and a move away requiring a jobseekers payment.  It is important therefore that these jobseekers continue to engage with their JobPath provider. </p><p>Jobseekers referred to JobPath who are also working part-time will have all activities including meetings with their personal advisor scheduled around their work commitments and the JobPath contractors are required to be flexible in the provision of the service in that respect.  </p><p>Often a lack of adequate and affordable transport is a barrier to people returning to employment.  Turas Nua works to help their clients put solutions in place not only for their appointments but also to prepare them for the reality of returning to full-time work.  Personal Advisers work with clients on their barriers to employment to ensure that when a suitable employment opportunity presents itself that they have a potential solution in place.</p><p>When a person is considering applying for a particular position, the Personal Adviser, where appropriate will discuss the journey time to the job and the person's available transport options. The financial implications of returning to work are also discussed and information is given on payments such as the Working Family Payment and the Back to Work Family Dividend.  Turas Nua provide a Job Start Information Pack for their clients containing relevant information on returning to work and also provide in- work support for up to 52 weeks after the person commences employment over 30 hours per week. </p><p>From the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2018 approximately 12,700 part-time or casual workers have been referred to Turas Nua, of which over 4,000 have commenced full-time work to date, as set out in table 1 below. </p><p>It should be noted that many of these clients are currently still engaged with JobPath, are still in the first phase of the service and thus will not have had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment.

CE supervisors, as employees of these organisations, are an integral part of that good work.</p><p>However, it is important to emphasise the fact that CE scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding.  They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions, pension contributions or the Pension-related Deduction, PRD, under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, which only applied to public servants. </p><p>The State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.  All employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account, PRSA, under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  </p><p>The issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p><p>Exchequer funded pension entitlements for CE supervisors presents very significant issues for the Exchequer.  These supervisors comprise just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  Nevertheless, on foot of the Labour Court recommendation, a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347 million depending on the numbers involved, which is hard to establish. This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p><p>CE supervisors may qualify for the State Pension (Contributory) if they have accrued sufficient <i>PRSI</i>contributions. The State Pension (Contributory) is not means-tested.  This pension has a maximum personal rate payable of &euro;12,695 per annum, increasing to &euro;12,956 in March 2019. </p><p>The entitlement to an occupational pension is not a matter for this Department. It would therefore be proper for the Deputy to raise this matter with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-12a.1781.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031200087#WRDD03400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 657, 658 and 663 together.</p>  <p>  Completion of registration to SAFE Level 2 - which is the process used by my  Department to establish and verify a person&rsquo;s identity to a substantial level of assurance - is the minimum requirement for a Public Services Card (PSC) to issue.  </p>  <p>  The Department uses facial image matching software to strengthen the SAFE registration process.  A standard photograph is captured during this process and is inputted into and stored in the facial image matching software. It is then searched against the Department&rsquo;s photo database to ensure that the person in the photograph has not already been registered using a different identity. </p>  <p>  While the PSC does store a person&rsquo;s photograph, it does not store the biometric or arithmetic template of that photograph. The collection and printing of a simple JPEG image on the PSC does not, therefore, constitute the collection or processing of special category data, as set out in the GDPR. </p>  <p>  To be clear, the photograph in addition to being printed on the PSC, is processed, in a separate process, via facial imaging software to create an arithmetic template which is used to detect potential identity fraud. This arithmetic template is not stored on the PSC, does not form part of the public service identity set and is not shared with any other third party. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s position is, therefore, that the SAFE2/PSC photo is not itself biometric in nature &ndash; it is simply a photograph.  My Department is also clear that it does not collect or share biometric data but that it does create such data for  its own use,  to enable it to carry out its functions in relation to the PSC, as set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  In this context, the Department also acts in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and  Article 9 of the GDPR.    </p>  <p>Article 9(1) of the GDPR prohibits the processing of special categories of personal data, including biometric data.  However, recital (51) of the GDPR provides that the &lsquo;processing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Article 9 (2) of the GDPR sets out exceptions to the prohibition on processing in Article 9(1).  These exceptions are further transposed into Irish law by way of the Data Protection Act 2018 and in particular Part 3, Chapter 2 and Part 5 of that Act.   </p>  <p>  Where the Department makes considerable efforts to authenticate identity, in part through facial matching, this should be regarded as a positive measure which protects an individual&rsquo;s identity.  </p>  <p>  It is the Department&rsquo;s firm view that these measures are necessary, prudential and of benefit to individuals by protecting against identity fraud and theft and that this processing is proportionate to the outcome in ensuring personal data is appropriately protected. </p>  <p>  The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) Opinion 7/2018 - referred to by the Deputy - relates to the Proposal for a Regulation strengthening the security of identity cards of Union citizens and other documents.  The EDPS is an independent institution of the EU for advising Community institutions, bodies and data subjects on all matters concerning the processing of personal data.  The Commission is required - when adopting a legislative Proposal relating to the protection of individuals&rsquo; rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data  - to consult the EDPS.    </p>  <p>  In summary, this opinion paper supports the objective of the European Commission to enhance the security standards applicable to identity cards and residence documents. At the same time, the EDPS considers that the Proposal does not sufficiently justify the need to process two types of biometric data (facial image and fingerprints), while the stated purposes could be achieved by a less intrusive approach.   It specifically states that "The EDPS understands that using biometric data might be considered as a legitimate anti-fraud measure, but the Proposal does not justify the need to store two types of biometric data for the purposes foreseen in it. </p>  <p>  The opinion paper refers on numerous occasions to dactyloscopic/dactyloscopy which is identification by comparison of fingerprints.  The Deputy should note that my Department does not collect or store fingerprints.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme currently supports over 39,000 recipients and almost 73,000 children.</p>  <p>  The OFP scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in 1997. </p>  <p>  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, compared to those who do not work.  This highlights that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.  Access to activation supports is vital to achieve this objective and it is therefore imperative that my Department continues to engage with lone parents to assist them into employment. </p>  <p>  The lack of conditionality on the OFP payment, which was unique in Europe, coupled with its very long duration, has, over time, contributed to long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among many lone parents and their children.  The reforms to the OFP scheme were introduced to address this issue.   The reforms provide enhanced access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service to lone parents once their youngest child turns 7 years of age. Access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education and employment support services is essential to facilitate lone parents to progress into sustainable employment and financial independence.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 contained a number of measures to support lone parents, including working lone parents. There was an increase in the weekly rates of payment for OFP. The income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients will increase to &euro;150 per week with effect from the week commencing 25/03/19 (the highest income disregard level to date).  The weekly rates of the Increase for Qualified Children (IQC) in 2019 will also increase the same week by &euro;2.20 per week (from &euro;31.80 to &euro;34) for children under 12, and by &euro;5.20 per week (from &euro;31.80 to &euro;37) for children aged 12 and over.  This measure will benefit over 370,000 children and will help to tackle child poverty.</p>  <p>  Any change to the OFP as mentioned by the Deputy would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.   </p></reply>

WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. Estimated expenditure on WFP in 2018 is approximately &euro;430 million and it is currently paid to almost 54,000 families in respect of some 122,000 children.</p>  <p>   To qualify for WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>   The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996. Indeed, a recent review of in-work supports found that the current range of supports works very well for the vast majority of families and facilitates an element of choice which allows them to select the option which best suits their needs.</p>  <p>   For low income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for WFP and working on a casual basis up to and including 3 days per week, jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes provide in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.</p>  <p>   Further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have potentially significant expenditure implications which are difficult to quantify. The number of families working between 15-18 hours and are earning below the relevant WFP thresholds is currently unknown. Also, reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access WFP from 19 to 15 could have a number of behavioural effects the increased cost of which would be difficult to predict. These effects include: </p>  <p>  - reducing the incentive to increase part-time hours, resulting in recipients on the minimum 19 hours threshold reducing their hours of work;  </p>  <p>  - attracting new recipients currently on higher wages above the WFP threshold, who might decide to reduce their hours in order to qualify.</p>  <p>  It is crucially important that WFP does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment.  The longer term goal of WFP, as an incentive to take up and remain in work, could be compromised if the nature of the work taken up is not ultimately sustainable without ever-increasing and perhaps ultimately unsustainable levels of subvention.</p>  <p>   Any plans to reduce the WFP hours-worked threshold below 19 hours would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

These show a cumulative increase of &euro;43.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents (and &euro;45.00 for unemployed lone parents). This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;39.25 for the average household. </p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is in the final stages of drafting the new Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy which will assemble in one place the range of policy measures across government departments that are designed to address the different aspects of poverty and social exclusion.

In light of these considerations and the low usage of the training rates the Commission was of the view that training rates should be abolished.

This parent is currently incentivised to work additional hours to qualify for Working Family Payment (WFP). Even at the WFP minimum 19 hours per week and on the National Minimum Wage, a lone parent on WFP is lifted significantly above the poverty line. </p><p>The SVP report uses the 2012 EU-SILC in-work poverty figure for single parents as the base line for its assertion that lone parent in-work poverty in Ireland has more than doubled from 8.9% to 20.8% since 2012. As the table below shows, the relevant EU-SILC figure for 2008 was 26.2%, so compared to the 2017 figure of 20.8% there has been a reduction of in-work poverty for single parents over the last decade, which puts a different perspective on this matter.</p><p>In-Work at-risk-of-poverty rate by household type - Single Person with dependent children<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>26.2%</td><td>18.0%</td><td>10.0%</td><td>10.9%</td><td>8.9%</td><td>10.5%</td><td>11.8%</td><td>14.0%</td><td>20.3%</td><td>20.8%</td></tr></table></p><p>Source: EU-SILC Data</p><p>Budget 2019 raised the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes and also increased the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients to &euro;150 per week with effect from 25/03/19 (the highest income disregard level to date).  The weekly rates of the IQC in 2019 will also increase: by &euro;2.20 per week (from &euro;31.80 to &euro;34) for children under 12; and by &euro;5.20 per week (from &euro;31.80 to &euro;37) for children 12 and over.  This measure will benefit over 370,000 children and will help to tackle child poverty. </p><p>With regard to increases introduced in Budget 2019 alone, for example, a lone parent working 15 hours per week at the National Minimum Wage is now better off by almost &euro;1,000 per year.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of Budgets 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are an indicator of the improvements over that time for lone parents. These show a cumulative increase of &euro;43.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents (and &euro;45.00 for unemployed lone parents). This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;39.25 for the average household. </p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is in the final stages of drafting the new Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy which will assemble in one place the range of policy measures across government departments that are designed to address the different aspects of poverty and social exclusion.  It is intended that it will include targeted actions to improve supports that allow lone parents to take up education, training and employment opportunities. The new strategy will include a programme of work to identify the actions and services that have the most significant impact on reducing poverty and deprivation for different groups, including children.</p></reply>

The development of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles is exempt from planning permission under Section 4(1)(h) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, where development does not materially affect the external appearance of the structure and must be installed by an undertaker authorised to provide an electricity service. The exemption relates to removing the requirement to obtain planning permission only. Works being undertaken to install infrastructure for LEV charging/refuelling also must comply with the requirements of the building regulations.</p>  <p>  The building regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation. Part B &ndash; Volume 1 of the Fire Safety Technical Guidance Document (TGD) which deals with buildings other than dwellings is currently under review and will be the subject of a public consultation process in the coming months. Provisions in respect of buildings comprising or containing car parking will form part of the review. </p>  <p>  The revised EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) contains new provisions which aim to accelerate deployment of electric vehicles.  Article 8 requires the provision of appropriate infrastructure, to enable the installation at a later stage of recharging points for electric vehicles, for new residential buildings and residential buildings undergoing major renovation, by 2020. It also requires Member States to lay down requirements for the installation of a minimum number of recharging points for all non-residential buildings with more than 20 parking spaces, by 2025.  This will be implemented in regulation by my Department by March 2020. The draft regulations required will be the subject of a public consultation process in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  The national specification for installation of recharging points is being developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) and a draft specification is undergoing a public consultation process at present. </p></reply>

However, a civil remedy is available through the Courts concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.</p>  <p>  The possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties was raised previously with the Minister for Justice and Equality. In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made, whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, for example, to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. Safety considerations relating to overhanging trees could also potentially be addressed in any such provisions. </p>  <p>  In response, the Minister for Justice and Equality suggested that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation, which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes, rather than through the Courts.  Legislation subsequently introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality has been enacted as the Mediation Act 2017.</p>  <p>  The Act, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, contains provisions to underpin a comprehensive statutory framework to promote the resolution of disputes through mediation as an alternative to court proceedings which should ideally be only used as a last resort. In essence, the underlying objective of the Act is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs, speeding up the resolution of disputes and reducing the stress and acrimony which often accompanies court proceedings, including those involving adjoining property owners.  </p></reply>

The scheme has proven to be far more successful than originally anticipated, and the level of funding issued by local authorities to end January 2019 is approximately &euro;106m, which is ahead of initial estimates for the scheme.  As a result, to date, a number of local authorities have issued loans to a level which has used up their approved allocations for lending for mortgage and home improvement.  Based on the latest information available, these are Fingal County Council, Kildare County Council, Meath County Council, Tipperary County Council, Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council, Wicklow County Council and Wexford County Council.</p>  <p>  I am currently in discussions with the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform regarding further funding for the scheme.  Specific allocations to local authorities for 2019 will be finalised when those discussions have concluded. In the meantime, the scheme remains open and all local authorities should continue to receive and process applications.</p></reply>

The scheme has proven to be far more successful than originally anticipated, and the level of funding issued by local authorities to end January 2019 is approximately &euro;106m, which is ahead of initial estimates for the scheme.</p>  <p>  My officials have kept me informed regarding the progress of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan on a regular basis and have been engaging with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the scheme since October 2018, when it became clear that the rate at which loans were being approved was higher than was originally anticipated. However, at that stage it was not yet clear that these approvals were being translated into actual loans issued by the local authorities. In fact much of the criticism at the time was that insufficient loans were being approved and/or drawn down. However, as Minister I had made a commitment on launching the scheme that I would seek further funding for it at an early stage, if necessary, given my belief in its potential.  It was clear from data gathered towards the end of the year that drawdowns were happening at an increased rate. Indeed, by the end of January &euro;106m had been drawn down, which accounted for some 53% of the available funding, at which point &euro;66m would have been more consistent with the expectation of funds being drawn down over a three year period.  I informed the D&aacute;il on 29 January 2019 that the scheme had proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which it would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency in order to enable its continuation.  I further indicated that my Department was in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to an extension of the scheme and that when these discussions were concluded I would make an announcement on the matter.</p>  <p>  A meeting with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform was scheduled for 4 February 2019.  However, this had to be rescheduled and took place on 5 March 2019. At no time was the first tranche of funding depleted and, following the meeting on 5 March 2019, I informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government that local authorities could continue to accept applications as discussions had commenced on further funding. As of the end of January 2019, &euro;106m has been lent, supporting 575 individuals and families to buy their first home.</p>  <p>  I am currently in discussions with the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform regarding further funding for the scheme. Specific allocations to local authorities for 2019 will be finalised when those discussions have concluded. However, in the meantime the scheme remains open and all local authorities should continue to receive and process applications.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. The RTB has a quasi-judicial role and it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to comment on, or to interfere in, the specifics of any case.</p><p>Complaints regarding the RTB&rsquo;s Dispute Resolution Service are outside of the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman, as the Dispute Resolution Service is a quasi-judicial process and case outcomes are decided by independent adjudicators and mediators.  If a case party is unhappy with the outcome of their mediation or adjudication hearing, they may appeal the case to a three-member Tribunal within the RTB. The determination order of the Tribunal may be appealed within 21 days to the High Court on a point of law.</p><p>The RTB provides a customer complaint service in line with its Customer Charter, which is published on their website, .  The RTB is committed to providing excellence in customer service and seeks to continuously improve its services based on customer feedback.

The new affordable purchase scheme is based on local authorities providing, directly or indirectly, below market price housing.</p>  <p>  The main tenets of the Scheme are as follows:</p>  <p>  - It will be targeted towards low- to middle-income first-time buyer households;</p>  <p>  - Discounts of up to 40% of the market price of the property will be provided;</p>  <p>  - The local authority will place a charge against the property equal to the discount provided;</p>  <p>  - The charge is repayable and the proceeds will be placed into a centralised affordable housing fund giving the scheme long-term sustainability;</p>  <p>  - The affordable dwellings fund will be administered by the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  In terms of the priority areas for operation of the scheme, this will be influenced by the economic assessments which local authorities were asked to carry out in relation to the affordability issues in their areas.</p>  <p>  The Act itself contains significant detail on the new arrangements, reducing the extent to which regulations are required. Insofar as regulations are necessary, the most immediate requirement is for regulations dealing with the making of schemes of priority by local authorities. I will be signing regulations which will deal with that issue shortly, which will allow local authorities to finalise their schemes of priorities by June 2019, as required.  Further regulations and detailed guidance will issue to local authorities thereafter.</p>  <p>  The affordable housing scheme will be open to applications according as projects are delivered.  In that regard, significant delivery is to be achieved through the &euro;310 million Serviced Site Fund (SSF), under which at least 6,200 affordable homes are to be supported over the next three years.  An initial 10 projects have been approved for &euro;43m of funding under the first call for proposals under the SSF.  A second call will issue shortly and the first homes are expected to be delivered in 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition, some 2,350 affordable homes will be delivered on mainly publicly owned lands being supported through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction.  The work of the Land Development Agency (LDA) will also be of crucial importance in terms of delivering more affordable housing; the initial portfolio of sites that the LDA has access to will have the potential, over the short to medium term, to deliver 3,000 affordable homes in line with the Government policy of achieving 30% affordable housing on State lands generally.</p>  <p>  In parallel with this, the Dublin local authorities continue to progress a number of other significant housing projects on publicly owned lands, including the redevelopment of O'Devaney Gardens, St. Michael's Estate and a site at Oscar Traynor Road in Dublin city, yielding over 550 affordable homes.  The timing of delivery under these projects is contingent on the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, but the local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p><p>Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments.  Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and put a plan in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.</p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The framework contains the following:</p><p><i>-</i>an explanation of the statutory provisions in respect of fire safety, namely the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, and the respective responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, occupants, local authorities;</p><p>- a range of actions that may reduce risk and improve the level of fire safety where deficiencies arise in dwelling houses, apartments and/or the common areas of apartment buildings; and</p><p>- a fire risk assessment methodology for professional advisors to prioritise the remedial actions, if any, that may need to be carried out on a dwelling.</p><p>The Framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard and I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>Additionally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade, my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:</p><p>- Amendments to the Building Control Regulations;</p><p>- Establishment of a shared services National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.</p><p>These reforms have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations.</p></reply>

The PRA must also be fully satisfied that a case is fully grounded, the nature of the title proven and that all interested parties&rsquo; concerns have been fully considered before registering a State guaranteed title.</p>  <p>  The number of first registration cases on hands is reflective of a large intake of such cases since the extension of compulsory first registration to the entire country in 2011.  The PRA has put an action plan in place, including targeted resources and business process improvements, to tackle the first registration case-load. Importantly, it has put in place a number of initiatives to enhance its engagement with solicitors aimed at improving the quality of applications received. In particular cases, for example, where processing is required to facilitate a sale, a request to expedite can be submitted directly to the PRA, in accordance with its customer service policy.</p>  <p>  Arrangements have been put in place by all bodies under the aegis of my Department to facilitate the provision of information directly to members of the Oireachtas.  The contact email address for the Property Registration Authority is reps@prai.ie.</p></reply>

This substantial programme, which comprised 24 projects, is now complete. The overall programme is estimated to have cost approximately &euro;972 million.  Funding of &euro;775.3 million was provided via my Department.</p>  <p>  Largely completed by the end of 2013, the Ballymun programme represents the largest regeneration initiative undertaken in the State. The State's investment resulted in almost 2,000 new replacement homes being constructed for the former residents of the original flat blocks. An additional 1,350 homes were provided via private sector investment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the programme provided state-of-the-art community facilities, such as the Axis theatre, along with neighbourhood centres to improve services.  In recent years the regeneration activity has focused on improving the area&rsquo;s environmental performance with various green initiatives, new parks and playing pitches.  Enterprise and employment generation has focused on the main street and retail parks, with many new employment opportunities created for residents of the area.</p>  <p>  In relation to the maintenance of dwellings, it is very important that local authority housing stock is maintained to an appropriate standard.  Under the Housing Acts, such management and maintenance is, in the first instance, a matter for each individual local authority, in this case Dublin City Council. Separately, my Department has provided exchequer funding to support the remediation of pyrite-affected projects.  This was in respect of 124 units at Sillogue 4 (&euro;9.3 million), 52 units at Carton Estate (&euro;3.2 million) and 4 units at Owensilla Terrace (&euro;400,000).</p>  <p>  An enduring regeneration project must extend beyond physical redevelopment alone. In order to be successful and sustainable over the long term, a regeneration project requires the rebuilding of a community and a strengthening of community bonds. Taken together, the provision of state-of-the-art community facilities, large-scale housing regeneration and new development, and support for local enterprise and employment, have enabled the Ballymun regeneration programme to be completed on a sustainable basis.</p></reply>

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there has been a reduction in the Board's compliance rate with the statutory objective period over the past year due to a number of factors, including an increase in the number of cases it has received. Total case intake in 2018 was 2,734, up 6% on 2017.  At end January 2019, the compliance rate for determining normal planning appeals within the statutory objective period stood at 39%, and for all planning cases, the rate stood at 42%.  </p>  <p>  A range of measures have been taken to address the situation, including the appointment of additional Board members and the provision of additional resources. Ongoing and planned recruitment processes will see staffing levels increase further in the months ahead.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied, taking account also of the increased Exchequer grant of &euro;18.5m for the Board in 2019, a 7% increase on 2018, that the measures involved will enable the Board to significantly improve its compliance rate over the coming months.  Indeed, the number of cases decided by the Board in 2018 was up 32% on 2017 and the Board's output is now at circa 250 cases per month.  </p>  <p>  The Board has a complement of 11 members, including a new Chairperson who took up duty on 30 October 2018, and an extra Board member engaged in June 2018 to supplement the normal complement of 10 members. While a vacancy have recently arisen on the Board within that complement, this is due to be filled shortly.  The Board also employs over 150 staff members including 10 additional dedicated staff engaged in 2017 to support the Strategic Housing Division. </p>  <p>   My Department will continue to liaise closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources to support it in the performance of its functions</p></reply>
