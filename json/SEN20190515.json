One of the key recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was the redeployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from non-core duties to front-line duties.  One of the non-core duties specified was the carrying out of security duties at courthouses by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The case with which I want to deal specifically, and the one I know best, is that of the new courthouse on Mulgrave Street in Limerick.  This was opened in March 2018 and has been a great addition to Limerick and to the delivery of justice in the region but, when it was established in May 2018, 22 garda&iacute; were reassigned from front-line duties to non-core security duties at the courthouse on Mulgrave Street.  This is a very inefficient use of the skills of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The key recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland were developed in an implementation plan published last December following the publication of the commission's report in September.  One of the key goals for 2019 under the plan is the redeployment of garda&iacute; from non-core security duties in courts to front-line community policing duties.  This is already the case in Dublin.  Security work at the new Criminal Courts of Justice building, opened in 2010, is carried out by a private security firm, G4S.  This firm also carries out security duties at the Four Courts in Dublin.<\/p> <p>Private security firms do not carry out security duties in any court outside of Dublin.  I want the courthouse on Mulgrave Street in Limerick to be the first outside of Dublin in which the key recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which is also a goal for 2019 under the implementation plan, is implemented so that these 22 garda&iacute;, who are needed on the streets of Limerick, can return to front-line duties.  We need them in suburbs such as my own area of Castletroy and Monaleen, Dooradoyle, Corbally, and Caherdavin.  They are needed in the city centre where many businesses have major issues with antisocial behaviour and theft.  The public of Limerick wish the see their members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on community duties, on the beat, on bikes, in patrol cars, walking the streets, and making people feel safer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They do not wish to see them tied up in performing security duties in the courthouse that could be carried out better and more efficiently by a private security firm.  I am not expecting all 22 garda&iacute; who include two sergeants to be fully redeployed because in the courthouse we will require garda&iacute; to exercise powers that private security firms do not have such as the power of arrest.  However, I want to see immediate action on this issue which I raised with the local chief superintendent, Mr. Gerard Roche, at the joint policing committee meeting in Limerick last Friday.  He very much supports my proposal, as does the superintendent in Henry Street Garda station, Mr. Derek Smart.  Can the Minister make Mulgrave Street courthouse the first outside Dublin in which private security firms take over security duties, meaning that the 22 garda&iacute; engaged in security duties in the courthouse can be redeployed to engage in front-line community policing in Limerick city and its environs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#A00500","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  <\/p> <p>On 18 December 2018 the Government endorsed the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and accepted all 157 of its key recommendations, including those related to the reassignment of non-core duties, subject to further evaluation.  The Minister also published a high level plan, A Policing Service for the Future, which set out the approach to implementation in the next four years of the commission's recommendations.  Their implementation is being overseen by a dedicated programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach, as recommended in the commission's report.  As set out in the implementation plan, work will commence on a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's role in court security in quarter three of this year, with a view to completion by year end.  The recommendations on responsibility for court security duties will then be implemented during the next phase of the implementation plan, from January 2020 to June 2021.<\/p> <p>Progress continues to be made on civilianisation, with approximately 410 new civilian posts sanctioned since the beginning of 2017.  I understand approximately 340 garda&iacute; were redeployed by the Commissioner to operational policing duties between the beginning of 2017 and the end of quarter 1 of 2019.  That is positive progress and civilianisation, including redeployment, will continue in 2019.  In that regard, the Minister welcomes the Commissioner's decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019 which will facilitate the redeployment of 500 garda&iacute; to visible front-line policing duties in 2019.  It is also encouraging that there continues to be a strong pipeline of candidates who wish to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the most recent recruitment campaign which closed on 24 April and attracted in excess of 5,000 applicants.  This level of recruitment will ensure we remain on track to deliver a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, to include 15,000 Garda members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p> <p>The issue of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being redeployed from providing security in courts is linked with the issue of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na providing escorts for prisoners attending court.  A value for money study of prison escorts was conducted last year, led by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Work is ongoing between the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and the Irish Prison Service to develop the recommendations made in the value for money study.  The review of court security provision as part of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland will be informed to a considerable extent by the outcome of this work, given that the management of prisoners attending court is largely carried out by the Garda and prison service personnel who escort the prisoners.  It is a major aspect of court security.<\/p> <p>The Department of Justice and Equality will continue to work with all of the agencies involved to progress the reassignment, to the greatest extent possible, of garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#B00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

In the Four Courts and the Criminal Courts of Justice beside Heuston Station there is high level security like that provided in an airport.  I want to see the same high level security on Mulgrave Street in Limerick.  Twenty-two garda&iacute; are tied up in carrying out court duties when they should be out policing the streets of Limerick.  I, for one, would like to see this initiative expedited.  The value for money study of prison escorts is a secondary issue.  I am referring to a mainstream issue, one I will continue to pursue.<\/p> <p>When the new courthouse was opened in Mulgrave Street in March 2018, discussions took place on the use of a private security firm.  It ended up that the Garda had to provide the security detail.  When the Criminal Courts of Justice were opened in Dublin in 2010, how did it happen that a private security firm was given the contract to provide security considering that when a new courthouse was opened on Mulgrave Street, Limerick, eight years later, the Garda had to provide the security service?  I will continue to pursue the matter with the Minister and Garda Commissioner, Mr. Drew Harris.

The recommendations made in the commission's report will be implemented on a phased basis in the next four years.  A Policing Service for the Future will be a living document that will be updated, as required, on a biannual basis by the implementation group on policing reform.  Based on the four-year plan, it is expected that all agreed recommendations will be substantially implemented by the end of 2022, the 100th anniversary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>On the specific issue of moving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na away from providing security in courts to front-line policing roles, the Department is working closely with all of the agencies involved to make progress on this goal, initially as part of the work of developing the recommendations contained in the value for money review.  This work will inform the wider review of court security.  It is not just a matter of court duties but also of the transfer of prisoners to and from courts.  The Government looks forward to continuing to work towards and support this goal through co-operation between the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and the Irish Prison Service.  Alongside the continued progress on civilianisation and recruitment within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the recommendations made in the commission's report will ensure more garda&iacute; are available for front-line policing duties.  I understand the logic behind what the Senator says should happen and that he does not want garda&iacute; to do what they are currently doing just because that is the way it has always been done.  We can change.  The report of the commission is very clear that we need fewer garda&iacute; in roles that could be carried out by civilians.  There are specialised skill sets and abilities in certain firms.  The Senator highlighted G4S.  It is an international firm which is carrying out the service in question all over the world.  We can use its skill set and expertise to continue civilianisation in order that we will have garda&iacute; on the streets.  They should be visible, out and about meeting people to get to know them and working and living in the community.  That also benefits the Garda tremendously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#B00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","time":1557912600,"counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#B00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will not say anything at this point; rather, I will wait until I hear the response of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.

The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is undertaking a focused review of the guidelines to address a number of key aspects, including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections.  The review essentially aims to strike a better balance between addressing the concerns of local communities over wind farm developments and the need to generate additional renewable energy capacity, having regard to our binding EU renewable energy targets, while also ensuring that there will be greater and earlier engagement with communities by wind farm developers.  In this regard, officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government have been working closely with officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the revision of the guidelines in the context of that Department&rsquo;s remit and lead responsibility in renewable energy generally, including wind energy.<\/p> <p>As Members may be aware, as part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, is being undertaken on the revised guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent or planning permission prior to their final adoption, with public consultation being part of that process.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government appointed SEA experts to assist in this regard, and significant work was undertaken during 2018 on the SEA process and the development of the revised guidelines.  While it was intended that the revised draft guidelines would be published for public consultation in quarter 1 of 2019, some delays to the planned schedule arose due to the publication in October 2018 of updated World Health Organization environmental noise standards, which consequently need to be taken into account in the finalisation of the guidelines to ensure compliance with best international practice, as well as the need to address certain Brexit related planning issues.<\/p> <p>As part of the SEA process, there will be an eight-week public consultation on the revised draft guidelines and the comprehensive SEA environmental report.  This will enable all stakeholders, including members of the public, to examine the details of and submit comments and views on the draft proposals.  Following the completion of the SEA process and the consideration of the submissions received during the public consultation phase, it is intended that the revised guidelines will be finalised and published in late 2019, after which they will come into effect.  The revised guidelines will then be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  In this connection, planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to ministerial planning guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their statutory functions under the planning Acts.

I and other elected representatives have written to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on this matter in the recent and historic past.  I am sure this issue has arisen in many counties and townlands.<\/p> <p>I will target my area of Carlow and its neighbour, Laois.  In the townland of Graiguecullen, both local authorities share an estate.  It is at the end of Carlow and borders Laois.  This has been a very good arrangement and proof that working together achieves great results.  This estate is one to be proud of.  The issue I want to discuss is the difference between what some families are paying in local authority rents and what their neighbours are paying.  Included in this discussion will be references to the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the system surrounding HAP regarding local authority housing.  Residents in this shared estate under the Laois authority have their rent capped at &euro;93 per week, but if they are a resident under the Carlow authority the cap is &euro;180.<\/p> <p>Added into this estate there are also a number of private houses for rent, and these households, which are in co-operative housing, should be able to apply for HAP but they are not allowed.  Some of the private homes are actually co-operative homes and tenants in these cannot receive HAP.  Co-operative Housing Ireland is a Government body, so why can a tenant in a Co-operative Housing Ireland house not qualify for HAP?  Why are they removed from a council housing list because they are in co-operative housing?  It just does not make sense that, in the midst of a housing crisis and when we have mechanisms in place to help people, that we are not helping them but pushing them into poverty.  These people do not qualify for the local authority housing list so they pay &euro;1,200 a month in rent.  They cannot afford a mortgage because they do not have enough savings.  I have raised the massive issue of local authority thresholds being too low to allow people to go on the housing list, but it has not been addressed, which is staggering.  There are well over 1,000 people on Carlow's local authority housing list, but a review is under way so I expect the figure to be much higher.<\/p> <p>Almost eight years ago the Department carried out a review of the social housing income threshold.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For nearly a year and a half the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, have promised that it would be reviewed.

The thresholds to qualify are unwittingly excluding people who should qualify for the social housing lists.  It is unacceptable that people who are working and doing their best are caught in the net.  They do not qualify to go on the local authority housing list and they do not get a mortgage.  The biggest issue here is that we have one of the lowest caps for local authority housing, at &euro;27,500, while our neighbouring counties Laois and Kilkenny are over &euro;30,000.  It is unfair.

The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is laid down in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966.  The making or amending of rent schemes under section 58 is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by the Department, including that the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low-income households; that provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and that appropriate local factors should be taken into account, including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.<\/p> <p>Since 1986, when rent setting was devolved to individual local authorities, different approaches have been taken to rent charging and setting throughout the country.  There are 36 separate differential rents schemes in operation nationwide.  While local authorities generally follow the household means policy, there is variation in the extent to which they apply the income disregards set out in that policy in that differential rent schemes and differing approaches are taken to certain forms of income, such as the working family payment and the carer's allowance.  With regard to caps on rent, a majority of local authorities impose a maximum amount of rent payable under this scheme for different property types, while a significant minority do not impose any such maximum rents.<\/p> <p>Considerable work has been carried out by the Department in developing a draft national differential rents framework for the purposes of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Such a framework has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, while retaining the general principle of rents related to household income.  This work is being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable and prioritise those on low incomes.  It is expected that the review will be completed in the near future.  At that point, any proposed changes to existing rent arrangements will be brought to Government as part of a wider social housing reform package of measures that it is hoped will be finalised in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#D00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will wait for the review because it is important.

I was not aware that there were joint estates such as the estate the Senator is talking about.  That is a specific example of where there is unfairness.  It seems from the response I read out that flexibility is available to the executive of Laois County Council to vary that.  If flexibility is there, I am very strong on it being applied in a fair manner.  On too many occasions, we as politicians are told by civil servants that we cannot do that.  The flexibility is there and it should be applied.  It is grossly wrong that if there is an estate between two local authorities, if there are similar houses of the same value, and people potentially working in the same venue in the town, that they are paying different rents out of their own pocket.  That is not fair.  There is no version of justice where that is right.  This suggests that there is flexibility for senior executives, the housing director in Carlow and the housing director in Laois.

It is an unprecedented move by the European Union to investigate a body like Insurance Ireland and I hope it can put to bed, one way or the other, the suggestions of engaging in cartel-like behaviour.  I am Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach which has engaged in a considerable discussion on all forms of insurance, particularly motor insurance but also public liability and employer's liability insurance.  We have seen festivals and various other community activities curtailed and cancelled because of high insurance costs.  I believe the investigation is particularly related to motor insurance.  It is welcome that the European Union will investigate the issue.  The high cost of insurance is very damaging to businesses, individuals, communities, sports clubs and so on.  It might be useful to schedule a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, who is responsibile for financial services and insurance matters to ascertain what he is doing on the cost of insurance.  Many of the proposals from his working group and  the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach have not yet been implemented.  It is important for us to receive an update on what is happening and why.<\/p> <p>I welcome the appointment of the new HSE director general, Mr. Paul Reid.  I knew him when he was chief executive of Fingal County Council.  He comes with a reputation for dynamism and activity.  He was very involved with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the time of the crisis.  However, in the health sector 20 of the 23 major capital projects undertaken since 2010 ended up costing more than the agreed contract price.  That is no way to budget.  It is an absolute scandal that the national children's hospital will cost at least three times the original &euro;650 million and probably much more by the time it is fitted out with all of its equipment.  It is important that we keep an eye on how the HSE is spending its money.  It is important that it be funded adequately to provide the services required.<\/p> <p>The availability of Spinraza, a drug to treat the condition of spinal muscular atrophy, has been raised in the House many times.  It is welcome that the NHS has approved it for use in England and Wales, leaving Ireland and Estonia as the only EU countries that are not funding it.  It is incumbent on the Leader to bring the Minister for Health into the House to explain where we stand on the availability of Spinraza.  I have not yet clarified whether Northern Ireland and Scotland are involved; the NHS announcement seems to be in respect of England and Wales.  The Taoiseach has often said if medical treatment is available in one part of the island, it should be available in the other.  If it is available in the United Kingdom generally and specifically in Northern Ireland, it is important that we have the same terms here.  I, therefore, call for a debate with the Minister for Health on the availability of Spinraza in order that he can outline where he stands on drugs that are being approved in many other EU countries but not here.

We have repeatedly promised councillors that we will review their pay and terms and conditions of employment, as well as their powers, but, rankly, we have done nothing for them.  County councillors were promised a review would happen by Hallowe'en and by the end of the year or at some other time.  I wonder if the many hopefuls who have never been elected before realise what they are getting themselves into.  As the miserable allowance they receive will be spent in looking after their constituents, they will get nothing.  If they live in places like west Cork, it will cost them money to run their cars.  They will finish up on boards of management in schools and education and training boards and they will simply not be able to afford to attend because they will not be paid proper expenses.  The bottom line is there is an urgent need for reform.  I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate in this House before the new incoming councillors take their seats in order that we will openly discuss in front of the public their terms and conditions of employment.  As I have no difficulty in discussing the terms and conditions of employment of elected persons in any public forum, I ask that we have that debate.<\/p> <p>I totally concur with my colleague Senator Horkan in what he said about the cost of car insurance and the issue of a cartel raised in a report issued today.  It is about time there was a detailed investigation of the issue, particularly when one hears about young drivers buying cars for &euro;2,000 and that it costs them &euro;6,000 to insure them.  Owning and insuring a car is not a huge issue in suburban Dublin, but it is simply prohibitive if one lives in rural Ireland and is an apprentice who must drive 25 or 30 miles to work each day.  The rule changes made are good and I do not disagree with most of them, but even if a driver gets to the stage where he or she has a driving licence, he or she cannot afford to drive because he or she cannot get insurance.  We have to change the way things are done in this country.  We need to debate the matter prior to any report coming from a European source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#H00500","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I again want to talk about the drug Spinraza.  I very much welcome the decision made by the British Government and the National Health Service, NHS, to provide it for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, SMA.  It absolutely and definitively puts the onus on the Government and the HSE to approve the use of the drug here.  I am delighted that another jurisdiction has reached a deal with Biogen and it also appears that the price has been lowered when compared with that offered previously, including the offer made to the HSE.  It is vital that the price be taken into consideration as the HSE considers its next move in negotiations.<\/p> <p>A very important part of today's announcement is the reference to \"real-world evidence of its long-term benefits\".  This, with the possibility of a reduced price, provides the impetus for the HSE to finally provide Spinraza to further improve quality of life for SMA sufferers.  However, it is imperative that this momentum not be lost.  As I have said from the very first time I raised the issue, time is of the essence for SMA sufferers.  Spinraza is a life changing drug for children in County Mayo such as Grace O'Malley and Cillian Mearns and others who are affected.  It is not lost on the families that after today's decision, Ireland and Estonia are the only EU countries yet to provide this treatment.  The HSE leadership team was due to meet this week to make a decision on use of the drug.  There are no excuses left.  Will the Deputy Leader answer the following questions?  Did the HSE leadership team meet yesterday to discuss the availability of Spinraza?  When will a decision be made?  Does the HSE have full information from Britain on the price paid to Biogen?  As I said, time is of the essence.  I personally know some of the parents and their children, as the Deputy Leader probably does, and they are watching their children shut down.  As there is a real lack of humanity, I ask the Taoiseach to intervene and ask the Minister for Health to provide Spinraza for these children. <\/p> <p>I welcome the announcement made today that &euro;20 million will be made available to remedy the pyrite problem.  We have called for action and met the Minister many times to discuss the matter.  It has been a long journey.  I commend the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy English, because he did give us his word.  We want to make sure the houses that are affected the most will benefit immediately from the money.  I am a little concerned that it will get caught up in local authorities which may not have the resources to do what needs to be done.

I have received messages from families who believe they are being managed in the run-up to the local and European elections on 24 May, given the absence of the announcement on this matter that was due to take place this week.  As stated, Ireland and Estonia are the only two EU countries that do not fund this treatment.  As other Senators stated, we need to have an honest debate about the matter.  I know that such situations are not easy to deal with, that the Government has to strike a deal and that the process can be difficult, but the lives the children are leading are extremely difficult, much more difficult than anybody can possibly imagine.  Therefore, a debate on the availability of Spinraza would be greatly appreciated.  I understand there will be another protest next week on 22 May calling on the Government to fund the provision of Spinraza.<\/p> <p>I refer to a shooting in Donaghmede yesterday.  Unfortunately, a shooting outside a shopping centre at 5.20 p.m. or early in the evening does not seem to receive much media attention anymore.  That is a shocking indictment of our society.  Shots were fired outside Donaghmede Shopping Centre at 5.20 p.m. yesterday.  The Government is almost disinterested in crime levels in that part of the city.  Whenever we raise the issue in this House, as I have done on countless occasions, I am told that the provision of Garda resources and the potential construction of a new Garda station in the hugely expanding area of Donaghmede, Clongriffin and Belmayne are not matters for decision by the Minister but by the Garda Commissioner, yet when the assistant Garda Commissioner said there was absolutely no justification for the reopening of Stepaside Garda station, Cabinet Ministers were able to make it their business to open it.  Why is Stepaside more important than an area on the northside when it comes to the provision of Garda resources?  Shots being fired at 5.20 p.m. outside of a shopping centre in Donaghmede is not normal.  Shootings do not happen in a normal society and they cannot be treated as normal.  It is not a case of business as usual because anybody could be caught in the crossfire.

Time is therefore of the essence.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will be dispatching officials within the week to Mayo County Council and Donegal County Council who will be responsible for the administration of the scheme.  This is very much to be welcomed because we will have expertise and knowledge on the ground, delivered by people who are very familiar with the locality and with the people.  It will make this scheme more accessible to individuals in Mayo and Donegal.  That is all very welcome.  The final details of the scheme are not yet confirmed.  Based on what I have just described, this must be done immediately.  I am not talking about doing so in a few months' time, but now.  People have to make arrangements so they need to know where they stand with regard to testing, engineers and engaging appropriate contractors to carry out the work.  For information, I also note that the scheme will be conducted in such a way that there will be an assessment of the most serious cases first, which will be proceeded with, and that other cases will be looked after subsequently.  <\/p> <p>This scheme has the potential to run for years.  The situation in which these homeowners find themselves is terrible.  They have mortgages to pay and houses they cannot sell, remortgage or do anything else with.  I will continue to fight until the scheme is up and running.  It has to be done immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#J00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I take the opportunity to reflect on proceedings at the inquiry into the Ballymurphy massacre in the High Court in Belfast over recent months.  I have commented on this, as have other Members, over the last number of months and, indeed, years and have indicated support for the families' campaign for the inquiry.  What has come to pass as a result - which has been both expected and, in some ways, very unexpected - is that those families have been traumatised all over again.  The details emerging from witness testimony at that inquiry, including testimony from former members of the British Parachute Regiment, have been chilling.  I have got to know many of the families that are campaigning.  I have been privileged to know them over my years as an elected representative.  It is important that we take the opportunity in this House to reassert and reaffirm our solidarity with and our support for those families and their campaign for truth and justice.<\/p> <p>In addition to the level of detail they have heard, which has been graphic and awful at times, the families are further traumatised, hurt and upset by the failure to report those stories.  That is one of the real frustrations that has emerged over recent months.  There has been a failure to focus on these stories in the way in which the press has focused on other legacy cases and news stories.  I do not advocate remaining in the past; I simply advocate for people to listen, reflect on and absorb the stories of the families who are going through live trauma and live legacy cases.  We should use this House as a platform to share their stories in order to assure them of our ongoing support but also to throw down a challenge to those in the media who spend an awful lot of their time reporting nonsense, fluff and rubbish and who do not take the opportunity to properly investigate the broader legal and criminal justice aspects of this inquiry which are coming to light every single day.  I encourage Members to use their influence and to be champions for the Ballymurphy families and their stories.  If possible, in the coming weeks before the inquiry ends, we should have a repeat visit from a cross-party delegation from this House, such as we had at the start of the inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#J00400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Yesterday morning I met the principal, staff and children of St. Teresa's special school in Ballinasloe.  They face a major challenge at the moment.  They have been given an insurance bill of more than &euro;26,000 for this year.  In 2017, the insurance bill was a little more than &euro;3,000.  In 2018, it was a little more than &euro;19,000, and the bill for this year is &euro;26,317.  Understandably, parents and staff are very worried because it is not possible to pay that bill without some level of assistance.<\/p> <p>I wish to emphasise the excellent work that is being done in the school every day by the staff who look after the children so well.  Currently, 21 children are enrolled for this year and it is expected that there will be 27 next year.  There is great uncertainty at the moment because the insurance bill creates a major challenge in terms of the school being able to function.  I have raised the issue with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh.  It is important that we would have an urgent meeting with him to address this issue.  A short-term solution is required and then we need to look at a longer-term restructuring.  It is critical that we intervene because parents are very stressed.  Having been in the school yesterday morning, I am aware that staff are equally stressed.  They provide an exceptional service every day to the children.  We want to ensure that the 21 children currently in the school will be supported and the 27 children due to be enrolled in September will also be supported.

The shortfall in funding is causing great anxiety and there is concern that the service will not be provided in 2020.

We were able to deal previously with pyrite.  Apartment owners and dwellers do not have a voice either in this House or in the D&aacute;il.  I have raised the matter continually in this House.  Approximately 70,000 apartments were poorly built during the boom.  As a result, there are concerns about fire safety, damp and water ingress.  Of most concern is the risk to life presented by fire.  The Government has continuously refused to give assistance to those poor people who have been stuck with apartments.  I call on the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House and address this urgent matter.  It is not acceptable for the Government not to provide a solution.  The Government has addressed other problems concerning poorly built homes.  Is it the case that the Government does not care about apartment owners because the turnout of voters who live in apartments in local and general elections is poor?  They live in gated communities and politicians do not hear daily the liabilities these people face.  They cannot sell their apartments, and they find it difficult to meet their mortgages, yet they face significant bills.  In the Taoiseach's constituency, residents have been asked for &euro;56,000 each to resolve fire issues.  The situation affects Castleknock, Cork, Galway and Dublin.  The situation requires urgent attention.  Other problems have been resolved and pilot schemes are in place.  I call on the Minister to come into the House and to make a clear commitment to apartment owners that they will be assisted in resolving problems that are not of their making.

The Cabinet approved a money message for the Bill in question yesterday.  This means the Bill can go through the D&aacute;il and be enacted.  We hope this will happen by July of this year.  The Bill is important for the families of missing persons.  I initially introduced the Bill in 2014.  I reintroduced it in 2016.  The Leader of the House, Senator Buttimer, worked with me to get the Minister for Justice and Equality on board in order that the Department would accept the Bill.  The Department has made some amendments to the Bill, but at least it is progressing.  This type of legislation has been up and running in Scotland for over 40 years.  The Law Reform Commission published a report on it in 2014.  I am delighted that it will be law here by July.  It will allow the family of a missing person to apply to a court for a presumption of death order if there is clear evidence that the person has died.  At the moment, there is no provision in Irish legislation to deal with that issue.  When a person goes missing, very little can be done to try to get finality on the matter.  I think this legislation will be helpful in such circumstances.<\/p> <p>I would like to respond to what Senator Hopkins has said about insurance.  I think there is a major issue here now.  The insurance industry seems to have availed of the upturn in the economy to adopt an attitude of charging whatever it likes.  This is a serious issue in many areas.  The message being sent out by the insurance companies is that increased charges are necessary because of an increase in claims.  I would like to see the figures for the total number of claims that have arisen in the past year or two.  How many of those claims have been settled and how many have gone through the courts system?  How much money has been paid out in respect of such claims?  The companies have not been upfront with us on these matters.  We are seeing substantial increases in premiums right across the board.  Now is the time to deal with this issue.  We need to deal with the amounts being paid out in claims.  We also need to make sure the insurance companies are not using the upturn in the economy to extract significant premiums from genuine organisations that are working hard to provide a service.  This is something we need to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#L00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank those who have raised issues on the Order of Business today.  We started and ended with the serious issue of insurance, which was raised by Senator Horkan at the outset.  I have a lot of experience in this area as a litigation solicitor who works mainly with insurance companies.  It is frustrating to hear what Senator Hopkins has said about insurance costs.  The way Senator McDowell put it really highlights the absolute insanity of it.  We have to get to the bottom of this.  It is really serious.  I have read articles suggesting that judges are awarding payouts that are far too high in certain cases, but it is not as simple as that.  It is right that inappropriate payouts get the headlines, but as a litigation solicitor who does a lot of work with insurance companies, I think the real issue is that 95% of cases are settled.  One might think that the insurance companies are quite right to settle because they make commercial decisions about cases.  That is what they rightly do as insurance companies.  They put an overall reserve on a case.  In most cases, they do not really mind how it comes to pass as long as a case settles for under that reserve.  Many more prudent solicitors, including those I work with, run cases when they feel they really should be run because it would be crazy to settle them.  I could give 20 examples.  This serious issue is quite complicated.  I think the insurance companies are the key to it.  I do not have a full understanding of the level of communication that is going on between policymakers and insurance companies.  It is something in which I would love to be more integrally involved.  It seems to me like something that could be pretty simple to sort out.  There is an urgent need for a debate in this House on this issue.  I agree with almost everything that has been said on it this morning.<\/p> <p>Senator Horkan also spoke about Spinraza.  I know the family in question.  I have had a lot of communication with someone on its behalf lately.  I saw a video of Grace O'Malley yesterday.  I met her some months ago.  I can see the deterioration in her.  One would need a heart of stone not to give these children the medicines they require, notwithstanding the cost.  We have to look at the reason for this.  As far as I am concerned, if one really looks into the matter, one will find that the system for deciding whether medications should be allowed is being played by the pharmaceutical companies.  There is a wider issue here.  They were looking at the UK situation to see how they would get on.  They knew that if they got a certain deal in Ireland, it would have implications for how the UK system might react to their request for money.  There is a wider problem here.  We need to look at how we decide whether medicines should be given to certain vulnerable individuals.

Communication is key in such matters and it further frustrates families when they are not told what is going on regarding provision.  Lack of information makes a stressful situation even more so.  I will relay her comments to the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the &euro;20 million repair scheme to assist homeowners in Mayo and Donegal whose properties are affected by pyrite and mica.  As she noted, there is now a clear pathway for people to address the problem.  She has championed that issue for some time.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred to the Ballymurphy families, an issue he has been raising for some time.  There are questionable legal and criminal justice aspects of the relevant inquiry.  I agree that it is an issue in which we all should take an interest.<\/p> <p>I have alluded to the issue raised by Senator Hopkins regarding St. Teresa's special needs school.  A short-term solution is needed.  The Senator might table a Commencement matter to get a direct answer from the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator Humphreys referred to Rehab and called for a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability services.  A debate on this and related issues would be useful.  The Senator also referred to apartment owners and a scheme similar to that referred to by Senator Mulherin.  Senator Humphreys has raised that issue several times and I agree that a debate would be timely.<\/p> <p>I have responded to Senator McDowell's questions on the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and the insurance issue.  I hope for his forbearance in terms of the time constraints we are facing in dealing with that Bill.  We are willing to work with the Senator to allow as comprehensive a debate as possible while also ensuring we get the legislation through as soon as we can.  We are willing to sit late to accommodate that, if Senators are amenable.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan spoke about several issues relating to Northern Ireland.  The crux of many of the problems there is that Stormont is still not in session, which is difficult to comprehend.  We will look to the leaders in both parts of the island and in Britain to sort that out as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>We all commend Senator Colm Burke on his tenacity and fortitude in getting the Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Bill 2016, which is important legislation, to where it is.  I have responded to the points he raised regarding the insurance industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#M00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Senator Craughwell has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That Committee Stage only of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#M00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Yes.

This is hereafter referred to as the CRRA and replaces it with a section 57, as well as additional sections 57A and 57C, all of which introduce a range of new exceptions for education, teaching and scientific research.

Senators may have been briefed on this issue.  The safeguards were inadvertently removed during the drafting process.  As I signalled to the House on Committee Stage, I propose to reinstate the safeguards by amending section 14 and Schedule 1 to the Bill and creating a new section that will amend section 173 of Copyright and Related Rights Act.  The changes to section 14 as proposed in amendment No. 3 are section 57(1) provides that it is not an infringement for an educational establishment to make a copy of a work, or communication of a work, for the sole purpose of illustration for education, teaching or scientific research, or for an educational establishment to reproduce a work in order to display it.<\/p><p>Section 57(2) provides that the educational exceptions are subject to the three-step test under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literacy and Artistic Works.  The three-step test provides that exceptions to copyright shall only apply if they are for non-commercial purposes, justified for the purpose to be achieved and accommodated by a sufficient acknowledgement.  This test is generally understood to apply to all copyright exceptions in the Copyright and Related Rights Act, but it is not explicitly stated in respect of the educational exceptions.  Therefore, it was considered to be a useful addition for the purposes of clarity, specifically in the case of the educational exceptions in section 14 of the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 57(3) reinstates the existing provision about which we spoke previously that no more than 5% of a work may be copied in any calendar year in order to avail of the educational exceptions, thus protecting the integrity of the copyrighted work.<\/p><p>Section 57(4) reinstates the existing provision that provides for the possibility of right holders taking infringement proceedings if a copy of a work is made under the educational exceptions provided for in section 57(1) and subsequently sold, rented, loaned or offered for same.<\/p><p>The deletion of lines 1 to 3, inclusive, in Schedule 1 to the Bill is necessary to remove the reference to education from the fair dealing provision for research contained in section 50 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act.  The inclusion of education in these three specific instances expands the educational exceptions far beyond what currently applies and would unreasonably prejudice the rights of right holders.  Amendment No. 15 deletes the table as it currently appears in Schedule 1 to the Bill and replaces it with a new table minus the information in lines of 1 to 3, inclusive.<\/p><p>A further technical amendment is required to section 57C(1) of the Bill which lists a number of sections of the Copyright and Related Rights Act to which the educational exceptions do not apply because of the existence of licensing schemes that must be used instead of the exceptions.  An amendment listed as amendment No. 4 is required to delete the reference to the phantom section 50A as it was not created in the Bill.  In addition, the reference to section 50 should also be deleted as it is a consequential amendment as a result of the deletion of the specific references to education from the fair dealing provision for research contained in section 50 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act.<\/p><p>As a result of the creation of section 57C related to licensing schemes for educational establishments, it is necessary to make a consequential amendment in section 173 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act to change the reference for the requirement for licences from section 57 to section 57C.  Amendment No. 6 proposes to amend section 173 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act.  This is necessary to avoid any uncertainty for schools and other educational establishments on the continued need to obtain licences for the use of copyright protected works to protect the rights of authors, publishers and education books.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#P01800","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 4:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 8 to 10, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.

We have not yet designed a digital deposit scheme to protect what is put online within 100 days.  What is put online is vulnerable to disappearing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Essentially, we are not archiving the digital memory that we put there, so what goes online during election and referendum campaigns and what goes online generally is not archived.  The solution is to allow the National Library, for example, the ability to sweep the <i>.ie<\/i>domain and to archive that for future generations because what goes online is so disposable.  An amendment was passed in the D&aacute;il, which provided that within 12 months of the enactment of the Bill the Government would bring forward a report on the feasibility of establishing a digital legal deposit scheme.  The delay in passing the Bill has also delayed that measure.  It is a source of anxiety for me that we have not dealt with the issue.<br\/><br\/>We passed an amendment on Committee Stage in this House that would legislatively allow for the creation of a digital deposit scheme.  We met officials from the Department since then and I understand that we are putting the cart before the horse in passing the legislation without having the regulatory framework in place.  Because I believe so strongly in the need for a digital deposit scheme, I want the scheme to be a success and I do not want it to be vulnerable to challenge.  Could the Minister of State provide an update on the current position in respect of archiving digital material and not losing our national memory?  Most web pages disappear within 100 days, so time is not on our side.  That was called for in the Modernising Copyright report published in 2013.  I support the amendment to remove what we achieved in the previous Stage, but I ask the Minister of State for a commitment that we would have sight of the heads of a Bill or a regulation that would allow the National Library to sweep the <i>.ie<\/i>domain and have freedom to do so and the protection of the law in order that we can archive our digital memory.  Time is not on our side.

Essentially, the intention of this subsection is to provide for a full digital deposit system that would facilitate the recording, archiving and making available of websites with domain names related to Ireland, the<i>.ie<\/i>domain and others, without infringing the copyright on the website.  This is often referred to as &quot;capturing, or preserving, the web&quot;.<\/p><p>The matter was debated extensively during Committee Stage and officials from my Department subsequently met interested Senators to explain the difficulties associated with that, and other matters, in greater detail.<\/p><p>The Department of Culture, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht has policy responsibility for the creation of a digital deposit scheme.  I informed the House of that on the previous occasion we discussed the matter.  The Department is working on the issue as part of its general work programme.  As I outlined on the previous occasion, some of the amendments could not be accepted because the creation of a digital deposit to capture and preserve Irish websites is not just a matter of amending copyright legislation.  It is a significant project, which requires the collaboration of multiple institutions.  Senators may have received a brief in that regard.  Significant resources and skills are required to capture and preserve the digital web.<\/p><p>The Government's position on the issue remains unchanged.  We have engaged extensively with shareholders and Members.  The Government supports the creation of a digital deposit of works as part of the nation's archive, but providing for a full digital deposit system that would facilitate &quot;capturing the web&quot;&rdquo; is not simply a matter of amending copyright legislation; it is a significant national project that must be done correctly.  This includes laying down sufficiently clear parameters about what material will be copied and preserved, as well as safeguards around the use of that material in the future.<\/p><p>Section 106 provides an opportunity for the necessary work to be carried out on the development of the policies and procedures around capturing the web.  That particular section, which was introduced following an opposition amendment on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is viewed by the Government as a pragmatic way to advance this project while allowing time for the important and necessary work to take place.<\/p><p>I, therefore, call for the deletion of the provision for several reasons.  First, the policy responsibility for this matter falls under the remit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and that Department is currently undertaking the necessary detailed and extensive examination of this proposal.  Officials in my Department have supported, and will continue to support that Department with its development of the proposal specifically in relation to protecting the intellectual property of creators and website owners.  Second, there are concerns with the text of the amendment, particularly in view of the level of work required to develop a robust regulatory framework to provide for &quot;capturing the web&quot; and the extensive nature of the provision included in the Bill going beyond the <i>.ie<\/i>domain.  Third, section 106 keeps the matter &quot;live&quot; while giving the time necessary to developing the appropriate framework.  Both Senators were informed of these concerns during meetings with my officials and I trust they will not oppose the deletion of the Committee Stage amendment of section 27(4B).<\/p><p>Related to this amendment seeking the deletion of section 27(4B), I also seek a minor technical amendment to section 106 through amendment No. 14.  This was a new section proposed on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and accepted by the Government as a pragmatic way to address the issue of &quot;capturing the web&quot;.  The section calls for a report to be published on the feasibility of establishing a digital legal deposit scheme for capturing the web &quot;within twelve months of the enactment of this Bill&quot;, which is a reasonable period.  However, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, as legal drafters of Irish legislation, has indicated that this should read &quot;within twelve months of the enactment of this Act&quot;.  That is its interpretation and what we have been advised.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Halligan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I call for the acceptance of a minor technical amendment to correct this oversight, which it was, and to ensure that the text is legally sound as we have been informed it is.

The Seanad debates in 2016 with the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the Government's last housing Bill were very productive and resulted in actual, tangible changes to the Bill.  Many of the flaws in how rent pressure zones were designed, particularly the lack of definition of substantial change in the nature of property for the purposes of an exemption from rent controls, were raised in the Oireachtas at that time.  I do not raise this to be party political but to point out that the Opposition has a role in this process too, and that should be recognised in the scheduling of debates.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 26 would require the Minister produce a report on the feasibility of a national deposit scheme and how best such a scheme could be implemented in the context of the Irish housing market.  This report would be completed within six months and delivered to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is an amended version of the amendment tabled by Deputy Darragh O'Brien in the D&aacute;il, so we are hopeful for the support of Fianna F&aacute;il for it today.  This is not a new issue and both Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party discussed it extensively in the D&aacute;il.  This is an area in which bad landlords gouge tenants and use larger and larger deposit requirements to thin out the high number of people competing for tenancies.  They are profiting from people's desperation, and this cannot be justified.  It is bad enough for those with the necessary financial means and for whom two or three months' deposit is an annoying expense to compete on these grounds, but for people on lower incomes a two-month deposit requirement is enough to put any potential tenancy out of reach.  It serves as a major bar for more vulnerable people competing in the private tenancy market, and those people need our support.  We have heard examples from other countries where this works, and while I recognise that a large body of practical work will be needed to implement such a scheme, we need to get on with it.<\/p> <p>I recognise that the Minister has committed to looking at this issue and that he plans to bring forward a Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny in the fourth quarter of 2019, but I am concerned by some of his remarks in the D&aacute;il in which he labelled this area as no longer the priority it once was.  The Minister has a large and very important brief and the Department works across many policy areas simultaneously.  He said in the D&aacute;il that the regulation of student accommodation was a higher priority.  I am concerned that this crucial issue may struggle to compete with the other items in the Minister's brief, and I would be reassured if there was a report, with a legislatively mandated timeline, that supported the pre-legislative scrutiny process which the Minister has planned for later this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have deliberately drafted the amendment to ensure that the process would match the policy development schedule that will be under way in the Department.  I see this as an amendment that will work with the provisions of the Bill the Minister has set out and in a complementary way to his own work.  It would provide major reassurance to us in this House and to Deputies in the D&aacute;il, where this issue came up continually on Committee Stage and Report Stage, that something will definitely be done.  Every attempt to provide for it legislatively in the D&aacute;il was rejected because the Minister said he did not want to deal with it in isolation but comprehensively.  If he cannot accept the amendment from the Labour Party, this amendment would support that policy development process.  This is worth the Minister's acceptance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#W02200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

We are seeing this all over the place.  We are also getting reports from tenants that getting the deposit back when they vacate a property is proving to be a problem.  My colleague, Senator Ruane, referred to the amount of money that is expected upfront when renting a property.  It has gone from a month's rent to two or in some cases three months' rent.  This is simply exploitation of people who are desperate to find homes.  I am familiar with people who are paying relatively little rent compared with &euro;2,100 in Sandyford.  I know a couple who are paying &euro;1,500 at the moment.  They are just waiting to be told that the property is to be sold and they must leave.

When we were originally drafting this legislation, I wanted to draft a Bill that would receive cross-party support so that we could move it efficiently, though not too quickly, through the Houses, given the changes we know we need to make in the rental sector.  When I first introduced the Bill, we were talking about giving tenants who receive a notice to quit longer notice periods, trebling or in some circumstances quadrupling the time they have to find a new property to rent.  Given the work students had done with all parties, we also knew that we wanted to bring student accommodation under the rent pressure zones to make sure students are not gouged by unfair rent increases.<\/p> <p>We also knew that there were a couple of things happening in the rent pressure zones, RPZs, that should not have been.  People were citing substantial refurbishments that did not really meet the definition but were just a lick of paint to enable them to step outside their obligations under the rent caps.  As we proceeded with the Bill, I saw other priorities that needed to be addressed urgently.  For example, under the current legislation, if we did not extend RPZs beyond December of this year, they would fall.  In this Bill I have extended them to 2021.  That is more important than a deposit protection scheme or defining deposits.  I will come back to that piece of work in a moment.  We have also changed the qualifying criteria for rent pressure zones and rent caps.  Dublin was racing ahead, which meant that other parts of the country could not catch up even though they were seeing rent hyperinflation.  By taking Dublin out of the accounting equation, we will now see rent caps extend geographically as well as in time, which is very important.<\/p> <p>We have done something else which I do not think has got enough recognition.  We are talking about large institutional landlords at the moment.  Previously, if they brought new stock to market that would never be captured by a rent cap, they could increase the rent year in, year out, with new or existing tenants, and they would never have to abide by the rent caps.  That changes now.  For the first time we are bringing large landlords and new housing stock into the rent pressure zones.  Tenants renting from them will be treated in the same way as tenants renting from an individual private landlord.  That is very welcome and it is a priority.  In addition to that we are bringing forward the regulation of short-term letting through a change to primary legislation and regulations which will be debated in this House.<\/p> <p>Those are priorities.  Unfortunately, our addition to the Bill meant that we could not accommodate other areas of work that need attention and there would be a delay.  There was also a delay in the Oireachtas.  We had built in time for more than enough scrutiny of this legislation by this House, as I pointed out last night on Second Stage.  However, because as a minority Government we do not control the D&aacute;il, we unfortunately lost time.  We are now in a very unfortunate position, which we are not happy about at all.  I am disappointed that the vote took place earlier today and I will tell the House why.  The ban on the short-term letting of homes where rent pressure is most acute was meant to begin on 1 June.  However, because of delays it is now set to come into force on 1 July.  I worry that if I cannot get this legislation agreed by both Houses and signed into law along with the accompanying regulations, which must also come before both Houses and be signed into law before the end of this month, we will not be able to move to regulate short-term letting from 1 July.  There are also weeks in June when other Government priorities need to be handled.  We have seen this happen with the national children's hospital, Brexit debates and broadband.  Things which we all agree are a priority get deprioritised because housing is at issue.  This almost happened last week.  I had to make an intervention in the D&aacute;il to make sure we could sit until midnight or as late as possible to conclude the relevant Stages.  The House accommodated that, which was a very good thing.  I very much worry that if we miss a week, which is the outcome we face at the moment, we could miss a chance to regulate short-term letting at all in the immediate months because of the further knock-on delays.  I recognise the very frustrating position in which this puts everyone in this House.<\/p> <p>Last night I said that I have a second piece of legislation on rents that I want to bring forward in the fourth quarter of this year.  I commit to commencing that legislation in this House so that Senators can do the heavy lifting on the further rent reforms we want to do.  They pertain to tenancies of indefinite duration.  That will provide much greater stability and security for long-term renters.  The further reforms also pertain to tenants who find that the property they are renting is taken over by a bank or other financial institution.  At the moment their rights are too ambiguous.  I refer also to properties in receivership.  We need to address all of these things as well as issues around deposits.  I am sorry that the House is in this position.  I am very sorry that the vote went the way that it did today.  I am worried now, because there are things at work outside our control as individuals.  If we do not act collectively, they could end up hurting the people who need us to bring these reforms through as quickly as possible.  I am available to debate this all day and all night today and tomorrow.  If it must be next week, I am absolutely willing to appear on Tuesday.  I still have not secured agreement on my side that I can come into this House on Tuesday of next week.  I am very worried about the risks that have been built into this process.  I recognise my part in those risks.  I will do everything I can to mitigate them.<\/p> <p>Regarding the amendments themselves, we all agree that a deposit should only be one month's rent.  That has always been the norm.  There was talk recently of people charging a deposit of more than one month's rent.  That was overstated, as we did not receive a huge number of complaints from tenants in that situation through the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  In some circumstances we know that a deposit of more than one month's rent might be charged if a tenant is bringing pets into the property.  That happens by agreement.  There are issues around it which must be looked at carefully.  As I said when it was initially put forward in the D&aacute;il, the amendment is unfortunately incomplete in and of itself.  Even if I accepted this amendment and put its definition of a deposit into the Bill, there are far too many ways of stepping around it.  As we move to define a deposit, we have to ensure there is no way to demand one month's deposit and two months' rent up front or other things like that.  There were recently reports in the news about viewing charges.  Those reports turned out to be spurious, but if we are going to put protections in place, we might as well protect people in all these other areas as well.  It makes sense to install those protections as one instrument.<\/p> <p>Regarding a deposit protection scheme, not everything can be a priority.  The things I listed as part of this Bill are more of a priority than a deposit protection scheme.  According to what we hear from the RTB, this became less of a priority since it was initially debated in 2015.  There has been some work on legislation for this, but it may be outdated now because the circumstances in the international financial markets have changed.  Previously, a deposit protection scheme would wash its face in that the money on deposit would be more than enough to cover the administration of such a scheme.  That is not the case now.  If there is going to be a cost to running this, who is going to bear that cost?  Should it be the landlords, the tenants or both?  We are talking about a significant amount of money, potentially more than &euro;300 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It potentially requires a new public bank because the RTB is not in a position today where it is able to manage that amount of money on deposit.  We then have questions about the administration of that money, who releases it, how quickly they can release it and, where there is a dispute, what happens.  The RTB already deals with disputes about deposits, but we are talking about something else entirely.  We are talking about a mandatory obligation on everyone involved in renting - landlords and tenants.  We, therefore, need to be very certain about exactly what we are doing if we are bringing in a scheme such as this.<\/p><p>When the amendment was tabled in the Lower House, it was withdrawn owing to an understanding of all of these complications and that a second piece of legislation was coming this year.  It was withdrawn because of the commitment I gave that in the interim we would do work on this issue and produce a report, given the changed environment, to see how it would be possible to do some of this.<\/p><p>I do not like to speak from personal experience and rarely do as I think we should speak about facts and data.  However, I know what it is like to lose a deposit and believe it is unfair because, like most of us, I have rented.  For most of my adult life I have rented in many countries.  I have seen how rental systems work in four cities.  I want to build a more mature rental market and sector in this country.  That involves doing things with deposits, which I recognise.  That is to what the report will work.  It will then be a matter for us, if the legislation commences its passage in this House, to work with it.  I cannot accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#X00500","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#Y00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>This is about as simple as it gets.

It is the recognition that this is the definition of a deposit that is incomplete.  While we might pass it and think we have done a good job to protect tenants who are being done by landlords who are looking for more than a month's deposit, it will not protect them at all because landlords can step around it by charging them a month's deposit and two months' rent.  Therefore, as we move to define what is meant by a deposit and consider a deposit protection scheme, issues to do with viewing money, even if it was perhaps a false concern, and key money can be looked at in their totality.  While we could pass something to give us comfort in order that we could feel better that we had stood up for people and could believe a month's deposit was reflected in legislation, unless it will make a practical difference, I do not see the purpose in bringing it forward.  It is not that anyone disagrees with the motivation behind the amendment; it is just that, on its own, it would not work.

A one-month deposit is the norm in the vast majority of cases.  I am not saying we do not need to legislate for it.  This brings us back to Senator Craughwell's point that there is a great deal to do around the deposit area.  There is a lot we need to do to make sure tenants are not being unfairly treated from a financial perspective in a number of areas that relate to, or run alongside, the issue of what a tenant is charged upfront when he or she goes to view, secure or rent a property.<\/p> <p>All of these things need to be considered in the context of a deposit protection scheme.  If and when we bring in such a scheme, it might have ramifications for the definition of a \"deposit\" and all of the other things we want to define in law.

The Bill will allow for an increase in energy efficiency, through the building energy rating, BER, as a ground for evading rent caps.  I welcome the amendments that the Minister made on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, such that phased increases will be needed depending on how low or high the original BER was.  It is a superior approach to one where any increase in the BER would allow a landlord to evade the caps.  We are proposing a minor change.  It would, in effect, ensure that C1 would be set as a minimal eventual rating in all tenancies citing this section.  Section 6(1)(c) of the Bill proposes the insertion of a new subsection (5A) after section 19(5) in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, and the proposed subsection (5A)(a)(ii) states that a rating must be increased &quot;by not less than 7 building energy ratings&quot; to evade the caps.  That in effect sets a minimum BER of C1.  The proposed subsection (5A)(a)(iii)(V) states that if the BER is at C3 or higher, it must be &quot;improved by not less than 2 building energy ratings&quot;, again setting the effective minimum BER to C1.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 would be additional to the proposed subsection (5A)(a)(iii)(IV), which relates to properties with a rating of D1 or lower, to ensure that when a landlord is increasing the BER, the eventual minimum rating cannot be lower than C1.  C1 is an objectively high energy efficiency standard and this amendment would align that subsection for lower-related properties with the provisions of the other sections.  If this work is being carried out by landlords anyway, we should set objectively high standards for how the efficiency rating is improved.  Energy wastage through energy-inefficient buildings is a significant contributor to greater reliance on fossil fuels.  If Ireland is to stand any chance of hitting its international targets, we need to make substantial strides on energy efficiency.  If a landlord wants to evade rent caps, it must be justifiable and the setting of objectively high energy efficiency standards will allow for that justification.  I hope the Minister can accept that amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 proposes that a landlord would not be able to cite a substantial change to the property as grounds to evade the rent caps in rent pressure zones without the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, first carrying out a physical inspection of the property in question.  Amendment No. 5 is a consequential amendment.  While I recognise the increased regulatory burden this would place on the RTB, we are now in a position where the rent pressure zones are not working and we need to act.  Rent increases, as demonstrated in the recent <i>daft.ie<\/i>report, far exceed the ostensible 4% cap and it is through the unfair and unjustified usage of these kinds of exemptions that landlords evade the caps.  While I welcome the overall attempt to better define and regulate these exemptions, we are now in an emergency situation that calls for an en emergency measure.  Good landlords would have nothing to fear from this amendment as a justified rent increase would be easily verified by the RTB.  It would be a deterrent to bad landlords and would be so significant that in my estimation, it could fundamentally reform how rent pressure zones work for the better.  I recognise that it could be difficult but the scale of the current crisis requires it.  The increased penalties and detailed provisions on what substantial renovations actually are will mean nothing if bad landlords are not detected for illegal or unjustifiable rent increases.  I hope that the Minister can accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#BB00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I have tabled amendment No. 3, which states:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:&ldquo;(VI) refurbishment that meets a per square foot value investment as set by regulations published by the Minister,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This goes back to pre-1963 housing.

The <i>daft.ie<\/i>report was mentioned.  This type of information is helpful but we have to recognise that these are the renting prices being asked, not agreed.  It is a much smaller data set than actual rents agreed and registered with the RTB.  It produces its index quarterly on what the state of rent is in different parts of the country.  It is important that we always speak about the official data and about as big a set of data as we can.  While it is easy to say that rent caps are not working, if that was the belief of this House, we would not be extending them to 2021 and changing the qualifying criteria to extend outside of Dublin, Cork and the other areas in which they operate, and we would not be seeking to improve them in the way that we are.  If we want to cite information from reports such as that from <i>daft.ie<\/i>, we absolutely can.  According to <i>daft.ie<\/i>, rents are at an all-time high.  We know that they are too high.  That same report states that rents are now growing at a slow pace that has not been seen since 2013, before the rental crisis.  That is important because it tells us that rent caps are working.  They are slowing rent inflation but they need to work harder.  They have not brought it below 4% nationally because they do not apply nationally.  They have not gone below 4% across Dublin because rent caps do not apply to new properties coming onto the market.  Until we pass this legislation, they will not ever apply to those new properties.  As rents are set each year for properties that came newly to the market in the last two years, they will go higher than 4%.  That will increase the average inflation in an area such as Dublin.  Until the legislation is changed, we will not see a more consistent level of rent inflation in line with the rent caps.  The RTB has said that, from the data it has seen, rent caps are working.  The purpose of legislation is to improve them.<\/p><p>These amendments speak to the complications that we have in everything that we try to do with housing.  We are trying to make sure that landlords are not abusing the idea of refurbishing or renovating their apartment or house for rent to try to get out of rent caps.  We hear anecdotal evidence that they are.  We published guidance on what refurbishment would look like to be able to step outside of the rent caps.  We recognised that we needed to put it in law.  We have to find a balance and make sure that we do not make it so difficult that landlords then stop investing in their properties and that the standards of our stock then worsen as an unintended consequence.  The primary purpose of this part of the legislation is to ensure that tenants' rights are not being abused by landlords applying a lick of paint and then saying there is a 10% rent increase, for example.  We have sought to define what a substantial refurbishment is.  Listening to the points made by other parties and people of no party on Committee Stage, we made a further set of amendments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On substantial refurbishment and building energy rating, BER, the BER is important because if one improves the BER rating of a property, one significantly helps the tenant in terms of the affordability of the day-to-day light, heat and other utility bills because of the type of work we are doing to houses and how that is recognised in the BER rating.  In addition, there will be a wider impact on the environment in terms of there being less of an impact on the climate.  Everything I am trying to do in regard to the standard of buildings being built - things like near zero energy building or having minimum BER requirements for new builds - will be of significant help in the other big crisis we are facing, namely, climate change.<\/p><p>Two changes were made on Committee Stage to recognise the importance of BER and the points raised in regard to pre-1963 and other properties.  Under one of the clauses, there are two separate BER grounds that can be invoked.  If a property has a very low BER rating, a jump of three points will required because at a very low rating it is easy to jump two points with minimal work.  If the property is at a higher rating, it must only jump two points, recognising that significant investment has already been made in the house to bring it up to an appropriate BER rating.  If one goes two points higher on the scale in conjunction with other measures such as improving disability access and so on, one can step outside the rent caps.<\/p><p>The other change we have made is that if one brings the property up seven BER points, one may step outside the rent cap.  That means bringing a property on the lowest point of the scale up to C2, or one on the second lowest point up to C1, for example.  We must recognise that that will be very expensive to do in some properties and that a minimum BER rating for some very old properties could be very difficult to achieve, would be seen as too onerous on the landlord and may act as a disincentive to investment.  That is the balance we tried to achieve.  One of the amendments looked at in much detail on Committee Stage sought to link it to investment per square foot or square metre but, unfortunately, it was not possible to be certain that we could properly verify that the investment had taken place.<\/p><p>I know there is a particular issue around pre-1963 properties because I have met people on this issue.  The solution we tried to reach on Committee Stage was the new allocation of seven BER ratings as a measure in and of itself that does not have to be combined with disability access, increasing the square footage of the property or other measures in the Bill.  If one brings these very old buildings up seven points on the BER scale, that would be sufficient to step outside the rent caps.  A commitment I give today on foot of the comments made is to publish the work done by the Department which demonstrates that, even in the case of a pre-1963 property with the different restrictions it has by virtue of the regulations already in effect, the system can be used to enable meaningful investment in the property and allow those landlords to step outside the rent caps because of the significant work done and the resultant significant improvements for the tenants moving into those properties.<\/p><p>On physical inspections, it is not always necessary to physically inspect the property to ensure it has met its requirements and obligations under the definition of substantial refurbishment.  The documentation required and the fact that it must be certified is verification that the works have happened.  However, if the RTB believes that is not enough or has a question mark, it has new powers for independent inspection and may inspect the property.  In addition, it is now an offence backed by very serious sanctions to knowingly give false documentation or information to the RTB and a landlord cannot try to use one of the definitions or exemptions just to get around the rent caps.  We have provided very strong legal provisions regarding what is allowed and that it is an offence if one does it inappropriately or misleads the RTB.  We have given the RTB the powers to make inspections and we trust it to use its judgment as to what is an appropriate level of inspections and what properties should be inspected.  Unfortunately, I cannot support the amendments because they have already been adequately captured in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#BB00500","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:&ldquo;(VI) refurbishment that meets a per square foot value investment as set by regulations published by the Minister,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#CC00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:&ldquo;(b) the works carried out under paragraph (a) have been the subject of a physical inspection by the Board,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#CC00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Section 6 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Sections 7 and 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 6 has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#CC00937","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 6 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051500002#CC01100","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557912600,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 9 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557912600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that amendments Nos. 6 and 7 have been ruled out of order, but I wish to highlight that amendment No. 8 has the same intention, namely, to extend rent pressure zones throughout the country for three years.

The calculation used involved rent being above the national average - which included and still includes Dublin - and having above 7% rent inflation in four of the past six quarters.  We recognised that it was very unlikely that more areas would come into a rent pressure zone because even though rents there may be increasing at 10%, 11% or 12% per quarter, they would never catch the national average because Dublin rents were pushing it up so high.  As a result, we are taking Dublin out of the equation when we look at the greater Dublin area, GDA, and other counties, and we are taking the GDA out of the equation for the other new qualifying criteria when looking at the remaining counties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a result of that, I anticipate, based on the inflation data that we have seen from the RTB, that more areas are going to be rent pressure zones, RPZs, which is very welcome.

Last month, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, if the southern end of Carrigaline would fall under the new Carrigaline municipal district and become a rent pressure zone.  He confirmed that it would.  However, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government confirmed that, &quot;The areas of Fountainstown, Myrtleville and Crosshaven will be contained in the Carrigaline LEA and will come under the remit of Cork County Council and as such will not become RPZs by virtue of the change to the boundary.&quot;  It raises the bizarre situation that different rules apply within the same local electoral area, which is surely bad policy from an administrative point of view for landlords and tenants.
