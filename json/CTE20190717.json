The minutes of the meeting of 10 July have been circulated.  Are there any matters arising?  No matters arise.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed?<\/p> <p>  The correspondence will be recorded as read into the minutes.  Correspondence 2019\/504 is an email from Mary Daly, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport concerning the future reappointment of Ms Rose Hynes as chairperson designate of the Shannon Group.  It is proposed to schedule this meeting after the summer recess.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence 2019\/505 is correspondence from me.  I forwarded the correspondence I received last night from Mr. Donal Conway, president of the Football Association of Ireland.  It provides an update on the current position regarding the governance of the FAI.  In the interests of transparency I wish to note that I received a telephone call last Sunday from the FAI asking whether I would be prepared to receive a private briefing from Mr. Conway about the issues in respect of the FAI view on the reports.  My answer was that would be unacceptable and there was no way in which any communication could, should or would happen without the full knowledge of the committee in full public meeting.  That is what we have today.  I offered him the opportunity to come before the committee, either today, tomorrow, Friday or any day next week before the annual general meeting to clarify the issue.  Subsequently a letter arrived in which Mr. Conway said that, provided he is still president, which is the issue, the FAI will come in after the AGM.  That is what that correspondence says and that is the origin of it.  If anyone has any comment on it that is fine, otherwise I can move onto the next item.  If committee members wish to comment on any of these issues the best place to do it may be when they make contributions.  I trust committee members are happy with that.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence 2019\/506 is correspondence sent to Donal Conway from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  That is the Minister's letter.  All committee members have a copy of it.  It was sent yesterday.<\/p> <p>  I received the next item of correspondence yesterday.  It is on behalf of the Soccer Writers Association of Ireland and the Association of Sports Journalists in Ireland.<\/p><p>They have written to the FAI to seek admission for their members to its Saturday EGM.  They asked me to raise this here and with Sport Ireland as an issue of concern.  I ask the delegates to carry the message strongly to the FAI that it is wrong not to admit those concerned.  The only reason we are meeting in the first place is because of the efforts of journalists who exposed all the issues regarding the moneys and other matters.  In the interest of transparency and the accountability of the FAI, it is right and proper that sports journalists be able to attend the EGM and report verbatim on its due process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#A00400","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1563318000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>In addition to asking Sport Ireland to do that, the Chairman should, on behalf of this committee, write to the FAI stating it is a requirement.

It is not down to Oireachtas scrutiny but a matter of allowing people to do their job.  Journalists have a job to do.

I am joined by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, Mr. Aidan Horan and Mr. Paul McDermott, as the Chairman said.  Mr. Horan will make an opening statement on the work of the governance review group and its report, which was furnished to members of the committee on 21 June, in advance of its publication.<\/p> <p>  Sport Ireland has attended meetings of this committee on two occasions in recent months.  Matters pertaining to governance in the FAI were discussed at length.  Today I will give Sport Ireland's perspective on the recent developments towards reform and examine the next steps in regard to the adoption of the reform proposals and, ultimately, the conditions by which restoration of Sport Ireland funding may take place.<\/p> <p>  The board of Sport Ireland welcomes the report of the governance review group.  The report provides a clear and comprehensive pathway for the fundamental reform of governance within the FAI, and a pathway for the FAI to emerge from its current difficulties.  The report is a significant piece of work and draws on the expertise and experience of the various group members, particularly in the areas of corporate governance, financial management, change management and football administration.<\/p> <p>  The report is detailed and explicit in its recommendations.  It gives serious consideration to the input of many stakeholders, as well the outputs from the football stakeholders' forum, hosted by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and attended by the Chairman of this committee and some of its members.<\/p> <p>  What is clear from the discussion at that forum and the large number of submissions received from members of the public and the football community is that a palpable appetite for change exists.  Indeed, the recommendations in the report have been widely welcomed and the commentary following publication has been overwhelmingly positive.  <\/p> <p>  While Sport Ireland is a key funder of the FAI, it is important to acknowledge the significant roles played by international partners UEFA and FIFA from a governance and funding perspective.  It is therefore welcome that the group consulted both UEFA and FIFA as part of this process and benchmarked its proposals against the principles and regulations of both, as well as those of other international football federations.  In this regard, Sport Ireland was pleased to hear that the outcome of the group's work has been endorsed by UEFA and FIFA.  This is an important development and sends a clear message to stakeholders at all levels of the game, from grassroots to professional, that these recommendation need to be implemented in the best interest of the game. <\/p> <p>  The report clearly and appropriately identifies the collective responsibility of the new board of the FAI in leading and directing the organisation's activities.  It will be up to the new board of the FAI to show leadership in the implementation of these critical, yet achievable, recommendations.  It is the view of the Sport Ireland that the timely implementation of these reforms is essential to the restoration of public trust and confidence in the FAI.<\/p> <p>  A new outlook is necessary if real change and reform are to be realised.  We now have a timely opportunity to commence the process of change.  The urgency arises from the need to provide the public, football community and stakeholders with assurance that there is determination in the FAI to enact necessary reforms.  The adoption and implementation of the recommendations of the review is only a starting point; the actions and steps that will follow will take time.  <\/p> <p>  While the report has been widely welcomed, one challenge facing the board of the FAI is reassuring all its constituents that the 78 recommendations included in the report of the governance review group are in the best interests of the organisation and the game of football in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  There have been media reports in recent weeks on some reservations expressed by some affiliates of the FAI regarding the proposed composition of the new board.  It is natural for reluctance to change and reform to exist among some groups in any change process.  We respect the autonomy of such groups but it is vital that they reflect on the current situation, as well as the implications and practicalities of the recommended committee structure and where their respective inputs and expertise are best suited.  One aspect worth highlighting is the establishment of the new football management committee.  This is essentially the new football board for the FAI and will oversee the business of football.  The football management committee will be the forum where all matters pertaining the game of football at all levels will be discussed.  <\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that the governance review group report recommends appointing an interim board for a period of one year.  The board must show leadership.  Its role in this regard is clearly outlined in the report and the skill sets required by members of the board to carry out its role and ensure the future successful governance and management of the FAI are detailed.<\/p><p>These include, among others, skill sets in the areas of law, governance, finance, and risk management.  The report further states: \"The necessity for the presence of these skills and experience on the Board is reflective of the requirement on the part of the Board to oversee the management and strategic development of a significant organisation.\"  <\/p><p> Sport Ireland notes that the FAI has been conducting roadshows around the country to discuss the recommendations with key constituents.  This is welcomed.  It is hoped that these discussions will lead to a better understanding of the proposals and the reason these changes need to happen.  <\/p><p> The board of Sport Ireland views the adoption of the recommendations of the report by the FAI as absolutely essential.  As part of the implementation of the governance review group report recommendations, the FAI will establish an implementation oversight group which will review the recommendations in conjunction with the FAI's rulebook and constitution.  The first task for this group will be to draw up an action plan, with associated timelines.  The FAI has invited Sport Ireland to appoint two representatives to the oversight group.  Sport Ireland has nominated Mr. Joe O&rsquo;Leary, who was a member of the governance review group and who is an experienced consultant, business psychologist and facilitator; and Mr. Angelo McNeive.  Both representatives will bring substantial expertise to the table and have the range of skills required for the group.  The FAI has welcomed these additions.  <\/p><p> As a joint commissioner of the governance review group report and as the statutory agency with responsibility for the development of sport, Sport Ireland will pay close attention to the work of the implementation group and will seek periodic updates on its progress as part of an ongoing liaison process with the audit and risk committee of the board of Sport Ireland.  <\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, in May of this year, Sport Ireland appointed KOSI Corporation Limited to carry out an extensive independent audit of the FAI.  The KOSI audit, which commenced in late May, is an exercise commissioned entirely independently of the association and will address the key issues Sport Ireland requires to be examined.  The KOSI team comprises senior auditors, including a forensic accountant.  The audit is independently assessing the expenditure of Sport Ireland grant funding in accordance with the FAI&rsquo;s approved submissions.  It is also examining in detail the FAI's wider financial administration and internal control environment, which includes assessing the FAI's fitness to handle public funds.  <\/p><p> This audit will include, but is not limited to, assessment of the compliance of the FAI with the terms and conditions set out by Sport Ireland in respect of the award of grants between 2015 and 2018; a consideration of good practice requirements and expected financial controls and of how the FAI matches up against these requirements; an assessment of the financial control framework within the FAI and the FAI&rsquo;s fitness to handle public funds; an assessment on the FAI&rsquo;s overall financial and cash position and its overdraft facilities to meet its financial obligations; an assessment of the existence and effectiveness of the FAI&rsquo;s financial policies and procedures pertaining to current practices within the FAI; and the undertaking of reviews, to include sample testing.  It is anticipated that KOSI will deliver its report in September, in accordance with the original timeline.  As the committee has requested, the audit will be detailed and extremely well done.  It is essential. <\/p><p> At its meeting on 9 April of this year, the board of Sport Ireland decided to suspend and withhold future funding to the FAI in accordance with clause 1.1 of its terms and conditions of grant approval.  This suspension and withholding of funding remains in place, and the board of Sport Ireland continues to review this decision at each of its meetings.  The board feels a number of factors are of particular relevance to the restoration of public funding.  These include, but are not limited to: the adoption of the recommendations of the governance review group, the establishment of new governance structures, and the completion of the KOSI audit and adoption of recommendations.  <\/p><p> As in previous years, the FAI financial statements for 2018 will also be presented to Sport Ireland.  Sport Ireland&rsquo;s financial controller will analyse the financial statements submitted by the FAI and highlight any concerns, potential risks or questions that may arise.  We expect the FAI to address any queries or concerns arising from that analysis.  Sport Ireland is aware of an ongoing investigation into matters relating to the association by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  Sport Ireland understands that the ODCE investigation is serious and will be very substantial.  <\/p><p> The board of Sport Ireland will continue to monitor these matters as they develop and progress.  A decision to restore funding will only be considered when the structures, controls and governance arrangements are in place within the FAI.  The board must also be satisfied that the FAI is equipped to ensure ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of grant approval.  <\/p><p> Sport Ireland places a high premium on good governance and encourages high standards in governance from all funded bodies.  As a development agency, it is our aim to provide leadership in this area while empowering sport organisations to take responsibility for their own governance and to meet the challenges they face.  Sport Ireland has reflected on the FAI issues, listened to the comments of members of this committee, and discussed matters with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Since Sport Ireland&rsquo;s attendance at this committee on 3 April, there have been a number of significant and pertinent changes in our oversight relationship with funded bodies and the supports provided to those bodies.  At its meetings on 28 May and 4 July, the board of Sport Ireland approved revised terms and conditions of grant approval for all Sport Ireland-funded organisations to come into effect for 2020 funding.  <\/p><p> A key amendment to the terms and conditions is the strengthening of the audit clause to explicitly confer full audit, inspection and investigative rights on Sport Ireland for every funded body.  The right to audit, inspect, and investigate may also extend to any matter of concern to Sport Ireland in respect of the organisation rather than just the use an organisation makes of Sport Ireland grant funding.  Other key amendments include making it an explicit condition of funding that Sport Ireland appointed auditors are entitled to request and receive all the information and explanations they require for the proper performance of their job; making it a condition of funding for all national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships that they must provide details of the full remuneration packages for their chief executives to Sport Ireland; and requiring that Sport Ireland be provided with independent verification that each organisation is fully compliant with the code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland by the end of 2021.  Failure to co-operate fully with any audit, inspection, or investigation on a timely basis will entitle Sport Ireland to suspend or withhold grant funding or to claim repayment of any grants previously advanced.  <\/p><p> The board of Sport Ireland is satisfied that these measures are appropriate and necessary in light of the recent learnings from the FAI situation.  We are confident that the additions will further strengthen Sport Ireland's authority in respect of overseeing public funds.  Good governance does not just live on paper; it is mutually dependent on behaviours and attitudes.  While formal terms and conditions play an important role in safeguarding public funding, they have a limited role in promoting and embedding good governance within organisations.  This is why Sport Ireland takes a multifaceted approach to ensuring that good governance is prevalent throughout the sector.  This includes encouragement and training and education to complement the outlined terms and conditions.  <\/p><p> The Government&rsquo;s national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies for sport and local sports partnerships adopt the code by the end of 2021.  Since we last attended a meeting of this committee, Sport Ireland has adopted the governance code for the community and voluntary sector as a governance code for sport.  This follows the decision of the governance code working group to retire the code.  Based on previous meetings, the committee will be aware of the numerous training and development opportunities and interventions available to funded organisations through Sport Ireland&rsquo;s organisational development and change unit.  This unit has been tasked with stepping up its output in building the capacity and enhancing the volunteer leadership capability of the sporting sector through strengthening governance, enhanced training and development of boards.  The FAI will hold an extraordinary general meeting, EGM, on 20 July to facilitate the implementation of the first phase of the governance review group report's recommendations prior to the annual general meeting, AGM, which will take place on Saturday, 27 July.<\/p><p>The recommendations in the report of the governance review group outline a pathway, which will secure the sustainable future of Irish football.<\/p><p> Sport Ireland respects the independence and autonomy of all funded organisations, including the FAI, and the right of their membership to make decisions on leadership and governance structures.  What is required now is reflection and determined action for the betterment of football across Ireland.<\/p><p> That is the FAI piece.  Will I continue with the other matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1563318000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Mr. Treacy should put it on the record anyway, even though it is separate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#D00150","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1563318000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will deal briefly with international recognition for Irish athletics.  We are aware that a delegation appeared before the committee in recent weeks under the banner of \"Friends of Irish Athletics\".  I would have been aware of this group some years ago.  However neither Sport Ireland nor the then Irish Sports Council has received correspondence from this group in many years.<\/p> <p>  Sport Ireland recognises Athletics Ireland as the independent, autonomous national governing body, NGB, for the sport of athletics in Ireland.  Athletics Ireland is affiliated to the IAAF, which is the world governing body for the sport.  Sport Ireland provides funding to Athletics Ireland to support its programme of activity across the pillars of participation, performance and high performance.  The IAAF constitution states that \"the jurisdiction of members shall be limited to the political boundaries of the Country they represent\".  This ruling was passed by the members at the IAAF Congress in 1934.  That rule has remained unchanged in the intervening years.  Of more than 60 national governing bodies of sport, 47 exist on an all-island basis.  Sport Ireland works closely with all national governing bodies of sport on an all-island basis and we work very closely with Sport Northern Ireland as well.<\/p> <p>  Member federations of the IAAF must abide by the constitution of the IAAF.  The rules of the IAAF supersede all other federation rules.  Member federations must clearly state this in their constitutions.  Under international relationships, an article of the Athletics Ireland constitution states, \"The association recognises, accepts, applies, observes and abides by the current Constitution, rules and regulations of the IAAF as well as by any future amendments.\"<\/p> <p>  Since the establishment of Athletics Ireland in 1999, extraordinary progress has been made in the day-to-day organisation of the sport on the island of Ireland.  It can be unequivocally stated that the current relationships between Athletics Ireland-Athletics Northern Ireland, ANI, and the Ulster Athletic Council, UAC, are the best in the history of the sport.  These relationships are enshrined in a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the three bodies.  There is also a separate operational document between Athletics Northern Ireland and the Ulster Athletic Council.  A liaison committee of equal representation from the three bodies reviews the MOU regularly.  This MOU has also been formally approved by the IAAF.  The primary objective of optimising all the athletic resources on the island is working with considerable success.<\/p> <p>  As evidenced by athletics teams comprising athletes from North and South, a pathway exists whereby athletes may represent Ireland in international events, including European, world and Olympic games.  Sport Ireland and Athletics Ireland are not aware of any current or recent athletes who have expressed dissatisfaction with the current arrangements in relation to the international recognition of Irish athletes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy"},{"type":"speech","time":1563318000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Treacy.

Within this opening statement, I propose to provide details on the group and the work undertaken to deliver the report, our agreed definition of governance, an overview of the main sections of the report, and our overall conclusion.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the group and work programme, the group comprised five members, three of whom were external members nominated by Sport Ireland and two of whom were nominated by the FAI board.  The FAI nominees were Ms Rea Walshe and Ms Niamh O&rsquo;Donoghue.  The Sport Ireland nominees were Mr. Joe O'Leary, Dr. Moling Ryan and, as independent chair, myself.<\/p> <p>  The group met on a total of 11 occasions over a busy eight-week period and, following the agreement to the terms of reference, we finalised a work programme to ensure completion and delivery of the final report by 21 June where we had committed to have a draft report by 14 June.  We were well aware of the seriousness, importance and urgency in delivering on a very detailed terms of reference so that any of the governance reforms we were recommending and those that were accepted could be adopted by the FAI as part of the July 2019 AGM process.<\/p> <p>  Our work programme and methodology included examination and review of documents and reports, including UEFA and FIFA statutes and regulations, and legal, regulatory and governance reports, codes and guidance.  We undertook research and engagement on governance arrangements and structures in peer football associations and a detailed review of all the submissions.  We attended the stakeholder forum attendance and we had direct engagement and meetings and interviews with key stakeholders.  We also reviewed FAI board and committee minutes as well as a range of relevant FAI governance and commercial agreements.  As chair, I confirm to the committee that all requests for information and material made by myself and the external members to the FAI were responded to expeditiously and professionally and there were no instances where information, where this information and material actually existed, was refused.<\/p> <p>  The report includes 78 recommendations which focus on governance principles, governance arrangements and governance structures within the FAI and which we consider, if implemented as envisaged, will commence the process of rebuilding and restoring confidence, trust and faith in the association and in how it is governed.  In a review of this nature where the focus is on good governance obligations, norms and standards, the emphasis is necessarily on what has gone wrong, on weaknesses and deficiencies, and on areas where urgent and significant improvement may be necessary.  I would highlight and acknowledge that during the review we were provided with much evidence and commentary by many people of the great and unsung work done by so many volunteers, mentors, coaches, FAI staff and others throughout the country.  It is quite clear that people care passionately about football and are invested in the game at so many levels, and they, like us all, want to see a much more successful, vibrant and well-governed FAI.  This report is our contribution to that aim.  In my chairman's statement in the report I included what I see as a critical issue, in that the report calls for serious reflection and determined action by those who have the authority and power to support and endorse these recommendations.  We also call for a serious reflection by those who see themselves as taking on a governance position in the FAI to acknowledge the profound duties, responsibilities and expectations that go with these roles.<\/p> <p>  Initial work was to come up with a so-called working definition of governance to direct the work programme.  I include the definition as follows.  Governance comprises the arrangements put in place to ensure that the Football Association of Ireland fulfils its overall purpose and achieves its intended outcomes for all its stakeholders.  It is concerned with leadership and direction, structures and authority levels, processes for decision-making, accountability arrangements, risk management, internal controls, and culture and related behaviours within the organisation.  At many of the events I have attended, I have tried to emphasise governance is a means to an end, not an end in itself.  The end in itself is the betterment and promotion of the game.  Governance as a means to an end has been a important theme that we have tried to address.<\/p> <p>  The report includes sections on submissions.  To clarify for the committee, as part of the review, we gave opportunities to people to engage with the group on governance related matters.  We received a total of 127 submissions, and all of these submissions were individually reviewed by each member of the group so that we were all in a position to have a wide discussion on the views and perspectives provided in the submissions.  Stakeholders also had an opportunity to make an input at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport Irish football stakeholder forum, which was convened on 31 May.  The output was collated and given to us by the Department on 5 June 2019 so that it also informed our deliberations.<\/p><p>The nature, quality and insightfulness of many of the submissions were of the highest standard and I am pleased to have the opportunity to publicly thank all those who made submissions.  We also met many stakeholder groups, which are listed in appendix 3 of the final report.  We held constructive meetings with UEFA and FIFA, as well as with clubs, players, referees, supporters, Sport Ireland, departmental officials and FAI board members, management and staff. <\/p><p> A section of the report focuses on principles and rules within the FAI.  In examining these, we relied heavily on the governance principles, regulations, statutes, reports and guidance from UEFA and FIFA, as key authoritative sources in this area.  We also looked at the code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland, the UK corporate governance code, the charities governance code, and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, among other documents.  The group recommended that six principles, which we consider the most appropriate principles, hallmarks and standards for the association, should be adopted by the FAI.  These principles should underpin the ethos, approach and philosophy of all those involved in the association, from clubs all the way up to the FAI board.  The proposed principles, as listed in the statement, are good governance, effective leadership, accountability and transparency, ethical behaviour and integrity, stakeholder engagement, and professionalism.  As part of our work programme, we undertook an analysis of the extent to which FAI rules are aligned with UEFA good governance principles.  This analysis is interesting, as it reaffirms the contention that formal rules play an important but limited role in promoting and embedding good governance.  Most of our recommendations focus on how governance should operate in the FAI, as well as related cultural and behavioural considerations.  These do not require rule changes as such but we advocate a better way of doing business, which revolves around culture and behaviour.<\/p><p> In the corporate governance section of the report, we focused on norms and standards across 16 key governance areas, which are of direct relevance and import to the FAI as a large enterprise with a high national and international profile, and as the national governing body for a sport with the highest level of participation in the country.  The 16 areas are roles and responsibilities; leadership; strategy planning and implementation; performance monitoring and reporting; risk management systems; performance accountability arrangements; internal control; board and sub-committee structure effectiveness; transparency and disclosure; capacity and capability of governance and leadership team; compliance with legal, regulatory and governance obligations; stakeholder relationships; engagement and management; ethics, conduct and behaviour; financial governance; management controls and reporting; and audit and assurance arrangements.  We also examined governance obligations in relation to joint ventures, third party arrangements and funding agreements, which were covered in section 5 of the report.<\/p><p>Our recommendations in the section on the board's role and composition are framed so as to better position the FAI to deliver on its governance agenda and to reflect the modern structures which are necessary for the successful governance and management of a football association.  It is widely accepted that the requirements of football administration and the associated governance demands have changed significantly in recent years.  The FAI now has a staff of 206 and an annual budget of approximately &euro;50 million.  Its operations impact on almost every community in Ireland and thus have a resonance at local, regional and national level.  The structures in Ireland have changed little to reflect these realities and there is now an imperative to put structures in place which reflect the reality of modern-day football administration and governance obligations.  In order to ensure delivery of this multifaceted role, the group has recommended that the FAI board be supported by a number of committees which will relate to either the business or football elements of its role.  The football committees, while maintaining a direct reporting line to the board, will also have a separate reporting line to a newly established football management committee, as will the business committees.  The football management committee will play a key role in the future governance of the FAI, and its remit will include oversight and advice on the development, promotion and regulation of football at all levels.  I am enthusiastic about what the football management committee can achieve for Irish football into the future.  This report has set out clear recommendations on the composition, memberships, skills and attributes for the new board, as well as clear proposals on the composition of board committees on both business and football matters.  These recommendations herald a serious and radical overhaul of current board and committee governance arrangements, with immediate follow-on implications for the council and the AGM.  Given the nature and extent of the challenge facing the organisation, and the issues that will arise and need to be addressed over the coming weeks and months, we believe it would be appropriate to have an interim board for a period of 12 months, given the current circumstances.  The recommendations in this section, which include new governance arrangements and practices, a new board, new committees and greater stakeholder representation, will allow for more effective and better functioning governance arrangements.<\/p><p> The group was conscious from the outset of the urgency of and necessity for change as well as the timelines for resolutions and changes to the rules on future governance arrangements and structures.  As I indicated earlier, many of the recommendations on corporate governance, third parties and the board's role can be implemented speedily and do not require formal rule changes.  What is required, however, is a fundamental change in approach, culture and attitude to how good governance operates within the association.  This change must be led by those who exercise and are entrusted with governance and leadership roles across the FAI, at council, board and committee levels, as well as across executive management.  We identified 16 immediate implementation priorities to be endorsed, sponsored and progressed in the coming weeks by the board of the FAI, which include the acceptance and endorsement of this report, the appointment of an implementation oversight group and an internal implementation team within the FAI as well.  Detailed preparatory work for the AGM must also be undertaken and rule changes and comprehensive terms of reference for the new board and committees must be put together.  This work has already commenced and significant detailed terms of reference for the committees have been prepared and circulated.  Comprehensive terms of reference for the new board have also been drafted.  This is further evidence of the importance, urgency and seriousness of the work which is under way to embed good governance in the FAI by clarifying the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of those with governance and leadership roles within the organisation.<\/p><p> I will make some final observations.  In the report, we identified several important areas and initiatives which merit consideration, including the quality, range and diversity of FAI programmes and projects across the country; the recent staff forum initiative within the organisation; the establishment of a supporters&rsquo; forum; having executive leads to support the governance structures and harnessing the knowledge, skills and expertise of staff and others; and examining FAI strategy and priorities for the future.  There is much goodwill from people who want the FAI to be successful and everyone acknowledges that urgent change is necessary and needs to be expedited.  There is a genuine and strong hope that these reforms will herald a new beginning.  We also identified additional areas which require more detailed analysis and consideration, with a view to tabling further proposals and recommendations at the July 2020 AGM.  These include membership, the AGM, review of the rules and the constitution, and the composition and role of the council.<\/p><p> On my behalf and on behalf of the group, I again acknowledge the valuable input, assistance and genuine constructive challenge from the individuals and groups we met.  In particular, I thank all those who made submissions and contributed to the stakeholder forum.  Discussions from the meetings and submissions were carefully considered and reflected upon and informed our deliberations and recommendations.  The report's findings and recommendations highlight the need for fundamental change and reform to facilitate better governance practices at all levels in the FAI.  This will necessitate greater clarity of roles and responsibilities at all levels, in addition to better planning, reporting, oversight and accountability, in order that those who are tasked with governance and leadership are in a position to carry out their duties more effectively, whether at board, committee, council or other levels.  This may require a further realignment of senior executive and management roles within the organisation to support the new arrangements.  The report's findings and recommendations, when considered in their totality, propose a new governance framework including principles, arrangements and structures which will support the board and the organisation in achieving and observing good governance practices.  This was the governance review group's key task, as outlined in our terms of reference.  It is important to emphasise that better governance is a means to an end to ensure the FAI continues to deliver, and can deliver, on its most important mandate, namely, the promotion and development of the game for all.  Our report is hopefully a positive contribution in this regard.<\/p><p> Before I conclude, I would like to make one final comment.  Since publication on 21 June, there have been some misunderstandings and misinterpretations about areas within the report.<\/p><p>An example relates to the six football nominees to the new board and the fact that they will come from the newly expanded council and not from the old council.  Those nominees will be asked to benchmark themselves against knowledge, skills and competencies required under a new constituency model.  If the recommendations are accepted by the FAI at its AGM and EGM, eight of the new 12 board members will be appointed on 27 July or very close to the 27 July, at which stage the task then becomes the search for, sourcing and recruiting of the four independent directors who will go onto the board.  Today is an opportunity to clarify some of those matters.<\/p><p> I attached to my submission a copy of appendix No. 10 of the report around governance structures.  This might be helpful to the committee.  I thank the Chairman.  It was my pleasure and privilege to chair the group.  I publicly acknowledge the work that my colleagues have put into the report.  I am very happy to answer any questions or provide clarification for the Chairman or the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Horan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1563318000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Horan.

Since the last meeting of the committee we took on board the voice of the committee as expressed to us very trenchantly at those hearings.  We undertook the governance review, which Mr. Horan has outlined in detail, and I do not intend to go through that.  An enormous amount of work has been done in a short period.  We also undertook to appoint forensic auditor accountants.  We had considerable difficulty in that as there was no response to our procurement.  I personally contacted a number of firms after that.  While they engaged in conversation, they were reluctant to get involved.  This was largely related to reputational risk on behalf of some of these accountancy firms given that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was involved and Deloitte had put up a notice regarding it.  There was a reluctance.  We got a firm from Northern Ireland to undertake this forensic audit for us and we expect it to report by the end of September.<br\/><br\/>We have put an emphasis on the fact that there is a grant funding round to consider after the budget and we need the report in.  The FAI is our biggest grant recipient in terms of national governing bodies.  The committee had asked us to explore our options around the terms of grant funding and our possible stretch with regard to the legal powers Sport Ireland might have.  We have done that and have now imposed, as we have submitted to this committee, new and onerous terms on governing bodies for their funding that go beyond the audit of funds given by Sport Ireland.  Of importance is that these terms are obligatory on them and include the remuneration packages of chief executives on which there was pushback previously because of commercial sensitivity etc., as enunciated to us.  Now we have cleared with our own auditors and legal advisers that this is quite within our remit to do in the context of new developments in corporate governance and so on.  Those terms will be in place for all the submissions made for grant funding for 2020.  We have met those specific concerns of the committee.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman asked about the board members.

It may well stop us from having situations such as this in the future.<\/p> <p>  Sport Ireland has made the point that this should be a new beginning for the FAI and this is what we all hoped for.  One of the key issues will be the interim board.

The response is one of disappointment but it is up to the membership of the organisation to emerge.  This is not the first time this has happened within sporting organisations.

What we wanted to do was to have no dilatory action on our part.  We needed the review of the governance to go ahead.  That had to be done as, otherwise, there would have been a drift.<br\/><br\/>Parallel with that, we have the investigations.  There is a bit of <i>realpolitik<\/i>around this.  There are two parallel processes, over one of which we have control, namely, to provide the governance pathway for the FAI and then for the FAI members to vote on that freely and deliberately, with all the information available.  As to the other process, I accept the point the Deputy is making in regard to the accounts of the FAI, which, understandably, I would say, Deloitte is still working through because of other issues it had with previous accounts, and the notice it put in, which led to the corporate enforcement investigation.  We have our forensic audit going on and they have Mazars.  I do not mean any disrespect to any profession, although sometimes I might say things, but in trying to push them to move with the alacrity we all would wish, and I have done myself in the past in getting disputes resolved, they do not seem to have the same deadlines.  We are trying to put deadlines on our report, which we have, but we have no control over the corporate enforcement.  To me, and I have said it, that is critical to the future.  Whatever they come up with may lead to certain changes being necessary in the way in which the FAI reports its financial and corporate affairs, either under the Companies Act, the code of governance or otherwise.  There will be an implementation period in which that will be addressed.<br\/><br\/>The other issue around that parallel process is the implementation.  We are central to that.  We are central to the appointment of independent directors in the sense that that will be an independent process conducted with full public transparency.  On the timeline involved in this regard, this time next year, I would expect that all of these processes will be in place so that, when the next AGM of the FAI comes up in 2020, it will amend whatever needs to be amended in the light of the reports that will then emerge.<br\/><br\/>One of the reasons I do not go into this is because, when I hear the words &quot;corporate enforcement&quot;, and I hear other things, alarm bells ring in my head.  As Mr. Treacy said earlier, he understands these to be serious and substantial in the engagement with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  All my hope is that if they are that serious and that substantial, we need traction on this, we need early deliberation and we need early report.

We have been informed, legally and corporately, that this is okay.  It arises from the controversies that arose not only in the FAI but also in other sporting and charitable organisations.  We are heavily reliant on other State agencies, particularly the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which has a regulatory function under the Companies Act.  On my last appearance before the committee, I may have posed the question as to who audits the auditors, but we also rely on auditors to do absolute due diligence.  It came as a surprise to everyone that Deloitte placed in a H4 notice on previous accounts of the FAI.  We do not have the competence or skill to undertake those audits.  We have our own audit unit but, ultimately, when it comes to the law, there are bodies in place for regulatory purposes.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy and Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked about the risks into the future.  In the terms of reference relating to its audit, we have asked KOSI to evaluate those risks.  We are aware, as Mr. Treacy indicated, that the FAI received either a letter of comfort or forward grant funding from UEFA-FIFA in the context of other moneys that may be due to the association from broadcasting rights relating to our international team, which is such a big focus of its activity.  We will have to wait and see what they come back with in the context of identifying the external risks.  I expect they are: first, loans the FAI must repay; second, potential income over the next season that it may achieve from broadcasting, transmission and attendances; third, the FAI's commercial arrangements with its sponsors, including the period for which the latter will continue to sponsor the association; and, fifth, the grant funding available from Sport Ireland, which is &euro;2.78 million annually, as well as capital funding from the Department's regional programme and that for the individual clubs under the sports capital programme.  There are myriad risks to current and future funding in that regard.  The Minister has made it clear, as has Sport Ireland in the context of the funding we provide, that unless the Augean stables are cleared, there will be no forward funding.  <\/p> <p>  We are holding the last tranche of the Sport Ireland grant until we are reassured that the FAI is governed appropriately and properly, that these reforms are accepted in their entirety and that it is given a clean bill of health.  We await Deloitte's finding on that, what comes out of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the KOSI audit, which I would like to see go coterminous in the autumn because our funding round for 2020 begins once we know what we are getting in the budget.  Then our board will meet, look at the applications from our NGBs, local sports partnerships and others and we will make decisions as a board in December for the payout of funds, if we can, before the end of December so that NGBs can forward fund their own programmes, or in January.

It was an issue in the past, too.  As Mr. Treacy indicated, when we went in in a way some people may have said was heavy-handed, we were rebuked for it, including by Ministers.  The second issue is balancing it with governing bodies.  In the past there was a pushback on remuneration packages for CEOs, not just from the FAI.  There was the issue of commercial sensitivity in the case of some contracts which was related to the ability of CEOs to realise commercial value of the sport for the organisation.  They said the matter was entirely private and did not relate to the grant or remuneration, as the CEO's salary did not come out of any public funding provided.  One had to watch that.

Reading this report initially when it was first published, my first fear was that it would have a knock-on impact on other associations in regard to getting their house in order.  Mr. Treacy has already acknowledged that there will be repercussions.  I welcome the report and I am delighted that the response from everyone was positive.  However, we have returned to a personality clash issue.  I wish to put on the record that on 9 July the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on foot of a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy MacSharry, stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI welcome the recent publication of the Report of the Governance Review Group... The Review Group has presented a detailed set of proposals covering a wide range of issues including the association's Board, commercial partnerships as well as audit and risk management.   <\/blockquote> <p>Had the Minister, Deputy Ross, not read the report by 9 July?  It has been referred to umpteen times at this committee, but everybody seems to be passing over this point.  I refer to page 74 of Mr. Horan's report.<\/p><p>Its deliberations should be included the record:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn acknowledging the exceptional circumstances that exist, and the many calls for a complete change at the top, the Group considers that, for handover and transition purposes and to manage the serious risks where everyone leaves at once, at least one or possibly a maximum of two members might consider putting themselves forward for positions on the interim Board.  This will require the current Board, as a collective, to consider their individual and personal interests but more importantly at this stage consider the interests of the Association and decide what they, as a collective, consider is the best course of action. <\/blockquote><p>I was led to believe that this was all to cover the board on an interim basis for 12 months to 2020.  I assume that everyone found that acceptable.  In fairness, Mr. Horan acknowledges at the top of the page that the board offered its resignation in full, but the proviso was put into the report that it should reconsider one or two of the members.  Do my committee colleagues have the other names that should have been put forward?  Two names have been put forward for the position of vice president, one uncontested and the second contested.  Is this not going well?  In fairness, it is only for an interim board for 12 months.  A lot is hanging on this decision and this deliberation because it will create more uncertainty.<br\/><br\/>My big concern as a member of the public, and in the context of accountability for taxpayers' money, is that the spin is that it is down to the clubs, which were not getting it, although we were led to believe they were.  I refer to the development clubs, the sports partnerships and so on.  Is this just a last-minute intervention on the part of the Minister, Deputy Ross?  This report outlines matters clearly.  Had they some other name in mind?  I cited at a previous committee meeting the case of a company in my own back yard, namely Dairygold, where changes were made.  However, one does not just make a clean sweep of management; one keeps some of the old guard and then moves forward.

I thank Sport Ireland, which has been in a difficult situation for the past few years.  It has dealt with this quite well, so far so good.  It is a situation it does not like to find itself in.  We are very fortunate to have such a competent organisation to deal with a situation none of us wants to deal with.  The FAI has form here, going back 17 or 18 years.  When the Genesis report was done, it was dragged kicking and screaming.  We hear nothing about the Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI, now.  It has got its house in order, fair play to it.  People must be falling over themselves at FAI headquarters because I have never heard of so many different investigations going on.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Treacy said Donal Conway calmed the waters.  There was talk at the previous meeting of an appetite for change but how can we be sure about that?  I understand that Donal Conway has been president of the FAI for the past 14 years and has been nominated unopposed for the presidency again.  That is not exactly the appetite for change we were told about.  I am trying to be a devil's advocate here.  We have asked that all the board members step down unconditionally.  Am I right in saying that if Donal Conway was the president he would be there only for an interim term of a year?  Nobody has asked me about this but Deputy O'Keeffe referred to continuity.  Is there anything in place to ensure that he would be gone after a year?  It seems reasonable, not from a political point of view but from a business point of view, to have continuity for a year with somebody who has the knowledge and who, as Mr. Treacy rightly said, has calmed the waters for 14 years? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#S00600","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1563318000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>He has been on the board for 14 years but he has been president for only one year.

The future president of the FAI, after these reforms, will not be the current president in terms of position and status surrounding the governance of the FAI because of the independent chair.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Peter Walsh, director of capital programme, Ms Geraldine Fitzpatrick, head of roads capital programme, and Mr. Paul Moran, regional manager.  I understand the committee wishes to receive an update on the current position regarding the upgrade of the Dunkettle interchange, County Cork.  I am happy to provide this update insofar as is appropriate at this time and to provide context about the overall scheme and its procurement.  However, I must emphasise the need to avoid straying into specific areas which might prejudice the outcome of the deliberations concerning the contract.  I am sure the committee will understand and appreciate the position in this regard.  In recent weeks, there has been speculation in the media on the cost of the Dunkettle interchange project.  As we are in an ongoing process, TII cannot offer any more clarity relating to cost or budgets until the process has concluded.<\/p> <p>  The Dunkettle interchange is the most complex interchange project in our roads programme.  More than 100,000 vehicles, including cars, buses and HGVs, daily wind their way through the junction.  It is located next to the Jack Lynch Tunnel, intersects with one of Irish Rail&rsquo;s main corridors and provides access to areas of high employment activity, such as Little Island.  It also borders a sensitive marsh habitat adjacent to a tidal zone.  In addition, there are major utilities traversing the site, including gas, water, power and telecom networks.  In recent years, incidents at the Dunkettle junction have caused significant traffic congestion throughout the city.  Delays at the junction regularly feature on national traffic reports.  The primary objective of the Dunkettle interchange project is to provide safer and more efficient movements through the junction by maximising free-flow traffic movements and reducing the potential for traffic incidents.  <\/p> <p>  On procurement strategy, due to the scale and complexity of this project, TII decided that the risk profile warranted an alternative approach to the standard design and build form of contract used on less complex projects.  This decision accords with the recommendation of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that consideration should be given to developing forms of contract or adopting standard forms published by bodies such as the Institution of Civil Engineers in the UK or the International Federation of Consulting Engineers for projects where risks cannot be accurately quantified.  The contract type selected to de-risk the project is the new engineering contract, NEC, with early contractor involvement.  This is a standard form of contract used internationally.  Following a review by the Government construction contracts committee, approval was given by the Office of Government Procurement for the use of a non-public works contract.  This decision was consistent with the findings of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform into the use of alternative contract forms for complex and high-risk projects.<\/p> <p>  This form of contract breaks the project implementation process into two stages.  The objective of the first stage is to de-risk the project in advance of the stage 2 mains works construction.  At stage 1, TII works with and pays the contractor to develop the detailed design and seek clarity on costs associated with stage 2 construction.  Utilising the contractor&rsquo;s expertise, construction methodologies are developed, including the design of complex traffic management arrangements.  The design is developed in detail to assist with reducing risks.  Quantities of materials are produced, as well as calculations of labour and machinery requirements.  Using these quantities and the tendered rates, the contractor&rsquo;s forecast of the cost to construct the project is produced.  The contractor&rsquo;s forecast of costs is referred to as the target cost.<\/p> <p>  On the history of the Dunkettle process, in May 2018, following a competition, stage 1 of the contract was awarded to John Sisk and Son Limited.  On the basis of the award for stage 1, the contractor has undertaken additional ground investigations, engaged with utility owners, undertaken environmental surveys, constructed a compound and developed traffic management plans and a construction methodology.  The design of the project has also been developed in detail.  The contractor commenced the submission of cost details to make up the final target cost in June.  These submissions continued into last week.<\/p> <p>  On the next steps, TII is now assessing these submissions to decide whether the target cost set by the contractor is acceptable.  This can only be determined when the submissions have been fully and carefully assessed.  It is anticipated that the decision will be made before the end of this month.  If TII and the contractor agree the target cost, the business case for the project is updated to reflect the agreed target cost.  As required by public spending rules, the updated business case is submitted to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for approval by Government.  If TII and the contractor do not agree the target cost, stage 2 will be removed from the contract.  TII will then return to the marketplace to seek to achieve better value for the taxpayer.  I wish to stress that this decision has not been made.  If the target cost is agreed, the process will remain on schedule.  However, if TII and the contractor do not agree the target cost, stage 2 will be removed from the contract and TII will return to the marketplace.  The construction of the project will then be the subject of a new procurement process.  However, I emphasise that the site investigation, planning and design work that has been undertaken by the contractor in stage 1 will be used as TII has retained ownership of this information.  A new tender process has the potential to delay project completion by some 12 to 18 months.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the strategic local and national importance of this project, it is certainly not a question of awarding the contract at any cost.  Rather, it is a question of achieving the goal of constructing a fit-for-purpose interchange scheme with the maximum value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  TII is committed to ensuring that this goal is achieved.  As I stated, we cannot stray into areas which might prejudice the outcome of this stage 1 process.  It was for this reason that TII sought to defer this appearance before the committee until such time as the stage 1 process is completed.  We did not seek to refuse to appear.  As our appearance before the committee comes during an ongoing commercially sensitive and confidential process, answers to certain questions may be perceived to be prejudicial to decisions which TII has yet to make and, for that reason, we must proceed with caution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1563318000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I will now open the discussion to the floor.  I thank the representatives for appearing before the committee.  Mr. Nolan referred to the sensitivity of negotiations with the on-site contractor.  As the delegates are aware, this issue has received much coverage in recent weeks, notably in the D&aacute;il Chamber a couple of weeks ago when it was discussed by the Taoiseach and by the leader of my party, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  Answers were not given.  Taxpayers are concerned about the cost of the project and the people of County Cork and the southern region are concerned about when it will be completed.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Nolan stated that a new engineering contract has been selected for usage because of the risks involved on the site.  If TII was aware of the risks and so forth, why were its figures wrong?  The project went to public approval in 2015.  TII estimated a cost of &euro;100 million for the contract within the past four years.  How did it get its figures wrong before the contractor was brought on site?  How did it get its figures wrong if it was aware of the impact of risk assessment matters on the budget?  Why was the cost underestimated to such a degree before the contractor came on site?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Nolan referred to the problems with the site, including the rail line, the river to the south, utilities going through the site and trying to operate while maintaining traffic flow.  The interchange is on a main arterial route, the M8 to Dublin and the East Cork Parkway of N25 which leads to Waterford and Rosslare.

We are not at the point yet where we have concluded a process and come to a final determination on the cost of delivering the scheme so to say we got our figures wrong is highly premature.  Changes have been made since 2015.  As he is aware, inflation is a major factor in any increases.  In de-risking the project in the past 18 months we have uncovered some additional risks that we would not have known about if we had not gone through this first stage.  The Vice Chairman described the regular design and build, D and B, type contract as the old type of contract but it is the new type of contract.  The pubic works contract, PWC, has been around since 2008.  It is reasonably new.  Before that it was re-measurement contracts.  If we got into a design and build contract we would have found those risks during the currency of the contracts and would have paid a heavy price for describing those risks during the currency of the works.  It would have involved additional moneys, additional time, significant delay and disruption, not only for the contractor but also for the community and all the motorists going through the site.  One of the benefits of investing in de-risking the project through stage 1 using the new engineering contract, NEC, was that we would reveal those risks which normally would not be revealed until later during any sub-engineering contract.  That was the benefit of stage 1.<\/p><p> What we learned in stage 1 can be mapped into stage 2 if we go to stage 2.  If we do not go to stage 2, those learnings and what we uncovered during the first year and a half with the contractor and all the development of the traffic management plans, which has a high value, will be used in any new procurement.  Either way, that work would pay dividends, shorten a re-procurement and de-risk the project significantly.  That investment was highly valuable.<\/p><p> With regard to the reason we opted for the new engineering type of contract rather than the old type of contract, I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Paul Moran, who is the division manager from the area.  He has come from Cork today for the meeting.  He has been living with this scheme for the past four or five years and I ask him to address that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#AA00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1563318000,"counter":382,"content":"<p>It is worth mentioning how crucial the Dunkettle location is to Cork because it is the key crossing point for everything coming from the north and the east.  We were aware from flooding events and so on of the disruption the project would have on the scheme.  We deliberately choose the NEC type contract, which is a two-stage contract, because stage 1 allows us get a contractor developed design.  It is about traffic management.  The way we manage the traffic on a daily basis, with 115,000 cars a day coming through the site, without shutting down Cork city and county for business is crucial.  The two-stage process allowed us get that very valuable view from a contractor and de-risk certain aspects.  If we did not do that and went out with a conventional type of tender, it could have resulted in significant additional cost.  The two-stage process is primarily to take cognisance of the difficulty of the site, which has many constraints.  It has major pharmaceutical employers in the area.  There is a railway line and many environmental constraints and, as I said, it is a key node into the city.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the earlier work we had done on that interchange, we have funded work on the N40 previously.

I worked on the Glanmire bypass in the 1980s and subsequently went on do work in Little Island and Carrigtwohill, and tied in with LotusWorks.  I am well aware of the challenges.  I could almost tell the witnesses where the ESB cables come down to light up the sign heading down to the tunnel.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on a few points although much of this is case sensitive.  I welcome the two-stage process with a type of safety net.  It is thinking outside the box and doing something different in terms of options available to prevent running into a pinch point, which has happened now.  The Dunkettle roundabout is a pinch point and we are well aware that something must be done.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  Mention was made in the opening statement of the target costs, which is an estimated cost.  For people watching this meeting, the target cost is an estimated cost.  Can Mr. Nolan cap that or are there certain clauses in contracts?  Previously, the opposite was the case.  A price was given and if a project was finished within time, or short of the time, one got a bonus.  That was a very different stage.<\/p> <p>  I have one or two more questions but I said I would be brief.  I welcome the fact that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has taken ownership of the site investigation and planning and design aspects, which means there will not be any duplications and money will be saved.  The plan is in place but who do we get to implement that plan?  As Mr. Nolan said, he is waiting for the target costs, which I understand.  Has that target cost come anywhere near to being finalised yet?  Can he give the public an idea on when the project will start?  He also said that, in the worst case scenario, if stage 2 had to go back out for retender, it could be another 12 to 18 months before the initial project might kick off.  Is there a possibility that regardless of what happens, some work will start within the next 18 months?  We need to let the people know that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the worst case scenario, is Mr. Nolan confident in saying that the Dunkettle interchange and associated works will start in 18 months?<\/p> <p>  To give credit where credit is due, we have been kept updated with what is going on at the site through emails and so on.  I compliment everyone involved in that.  However, the one issue, which has been mentioned by the Vice Chairman, is the perception of what is going out in the media and whether it is fake or real news.  People are confused.  The Vice Chairman referred to millions of euro earlier.  If the cost targets have not been set yet there are no moneys costed.  That is being realistic.  Are any of the witnesses in a position to confirm for the public that moneys have not been costed yet and that it will depend on the TII first and then the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to sanction that?<\/p> <p>  The most important point is that it is accepted nationally, and Mr. Nolan said it in his opening statement, that this is the most complex interchange project in his programme.  It is a massive project but it has to be done because Cork cannot grow with this pinch point.  It will certainly do a great deal of damage to infrastructure.  In terms of employment, we need Cork to grow.  We have the plans for the future.  It will also affect housing and every other area.<\/p> <p>  We have more than 12,500 km of roads in Cork and it is difficult enough to keep those resurfaced and so on.  That is a different story but, realistically, can the witnesses be confident, from the position we are in today, that in 18 months we will not be back here asking the reason work has not started?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#BB00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1563318000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a few questions.

Getting that was a hurdle.  Unfortunately, we had two lean years and we were waiting until the end of 2015 before a programme was announced in which Dunkettle was included.  We got going straight away by appointing consultants and thinking about the strategy that would be necessary to deliver this with the minimum disruption.  The objective here is minimum disruption to Cork, to deal with vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians and to try to get it done as efficiently as possible.  In terms of developing the strategy to use the NEC, we went back to the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the Government contracts committee, GCC, to talk to them about a derogation because we needed that to deviate from the public works contract.  We went out to the market.  The first thing we did was invite in all the contractors and ask them what they thought.  We told them we had this problem and asked what they thought was the best way of dealing with it.  That was invaluable because we got a very good idea of what the hurdles would be as we proceeded through procurement to get stage 2 up and running.<\/p> <p>  Communications have been foremost in our minds because of the number of people who go through it and the delays it causes.  The communication groups are utilising the chambers of commerce and developing a dedicated traffic application that will give users a visual idea of the delay there and, hopefully, help users perhaps change the times they leave or go to work, if that is possible.  We are also launching a traffic website to help people understand.  Once we start building this, there will be three years of construction.  There is all of that along with the work that has been done in the last 12 months.  We should talk about that further.  Stage 1 has allowed us to de-risk it, as I mentioned, and to do many enabling works.  The public has seen the yellow jackets there for diversions, getting rid of the archaeology and the resolution that is needed there and dealing with some of the environmental constraints, rather than leaving it for construction.

That might have given the impression that things had stopped and the money had dried up.  That is unfortunate, but that is the nature of stage 2.  Usually on a major infrastructure project of this type, when people go away work is happening behind the hedgerow and nobody sees it.  However, this is a highly visible location so people see the activity and then they see no activity.

This is not a new form of contract.  It is used all over the world.  Work on most highways in England makes use of early contractor involvement.  It is only when all of the site is exposed that all of the risks are seen.  One cannot expose all of the site in the contract.  It is not a house; these projects have a massive and very varied footprint.  Much of the ground in Cork along the River Lee is made ground and is very sensitive because it is former marshland.  The Vice Chairman asked why all of this work was not done before stage 1.  The rationale for having this stage and the early involvement of contractors was exactly that.  If contractors are involved later in the process claims of disruption can arise during the contract.  This process allows us to collaborate.  The project is an alliance or collaboration with the contractor.  We get the benefits of their experience, expertise and foresight to ensure de-risking.  All investment in stage 1 is aimed at de-risking the project.  I will hand over to Mr. Walsh to expand on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1563318000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>The Vice Chairman said that we went to Government for approval to enter into the contract, but we did not do so for stage 1.

Under normal circumstances, we would bring the contract through to a higher level of detail.  The Vice Chairman is quite right in that.  We would figure out what risks we might meet with our design and engineering contractors.  In this case, it was judged that the construction, the management of traffic and the management of the poor ground would be key.  The people best placed to untangle those issues and fully assess the risks are contractors.  It would be better and more helpful for everyone to view stage 1 as a continuation of the design process.  It is at the end of that stage that we know what the risks are.  We then have much greater confidence in assessing the likely cost to the taxpayer of delivering the project.

Over recent years, TII has built up a well-deserved reputation for bringing in projects, especially road projects, on budget.  It has developed a sort of mechanism or strategy, which is often cited in other Departments.  Will the witnesses walk me through how this was developed?  The Luas cross city project undertaken with the National Transport Authority, for example, has been cited over and over as being best in class with regard to the cost of projects.

Most of our schemes come in on time and either on budget or under budget.  In the first ten years of the organisation's existence, when we were still called the National Roads Authority, NRA, we were coming from a standing start and a low base.  We did not have a stock of learning.  We did not have a throughput or a portfolio of schemes to have learned from.  By the early 2000s we had turned that around.  In the first ten years, from 1994 until 2003 or 2004, we were in tune with international comparators.  Our schemes generally ran 15% to 25% over budget.  There were many such schemes in those days.  Since then we have capitalised on those lessons learned and implemented new processes and ways to do work.  We now generally come in approximately 10% under budget.  It must be remembered, however, that we carry out schemes in portfolios.  We do not insist that every scheme come in under budget.  If budgets get too high, we have to keep them down.<\/p> <p>  We came up with this probabilistic kind of forecasting model for costs and cost ranges.  We use outturn costs rather than estimated costs.  We have built up a database of outturn costs.  We also consider the base costs.  Our engineering advisers and local authorities help us with those costs.  We carry out a quantitative risk analysis of that and end up with a value of P50.  This means that there is a 50% probability that a scheme will come in under budget, but also a 50% probability that it will come in over budget.  We then carry out an analysis at P80.  This higher figure means that there is an 80% chance of coming in under budget and a 20% change of going over.  We test those two scenarios against low growth and high growth in demand.  We draw up a matrix of low growth against high cost and high growth against low cost.  We do all that when developing the business case.  We test it.  It is very probabilistic.  This is the way such things are done internationally.<\/p> <p>  We also use a hybrid type of reference task forecasting.  This is used in the UK, Australia, Switzerland and Denmark.  We use the structured consistent data we have accumulated from previous outcomes.  That works well in most cases.  We have actually developed confidence curves, again using measures of 50% and 80%.  We have used a hybrid form of that process and we are now going to formalise this reference task forecasting over the coming years.  This is recognised internationally as another way of looking at projects.  We build up the rates from our own inside perspective and then look at it from the outside and take account of all the unknown unknowns we can apply to a project.  When one has a long history of delivering projects, one accumulates a large amount of data, which is really valuable.<\/p> <p>  Bespoke schemes like Dunkettle are complex.  This is the only scheme like it we have done, so we do not have a long run of examples to leverage.  That results in a higher level of risk.  We have had a good run.  We do not desire that every scheme come in under budget.  If they did, it would mean that we had too much money reserved for those schemes, money which could be used for other projects.  We bring it down a bit.  We are happy if eight schemes in a portfolio come in on or under budget.  The two that run over will be balanced out by the eight.<\/p><p>That is fine in a portfolio situation.

We learned of the need to do as many investigations as possible.  There are some things we cannot do because they have to be done as part of the main works.  We get the services out of the way and we have a design-and-build formal contract.  The contractor helps us to design.  This goes back to Mr. Moran's point.  The contractor is good at designing because the firm is good at managing earthworks.  Office space engineers and people based in site compounds have different skill sets.  If we marry the two skill sets together, we get a better result.  We changed to a design-and-build formal contract in the early 2000s.  That has served us well.  We also standardised our standards.  We standardised our bridges.  Every bridge used to look different but now many bridges look the same.  We now have thousands of bridges all with a design life of approximately 120 years.  They are far more easily maintained and constructed.  They are not feature statements for designers.<\/p> <p>  We also do more on the environmental side.  We do far more balancing earthworks and use as many of the resources as we can on site.  We minimise what is taken off site and minimise the material to be imported on site.  That came from a long run of projects and hard lessons learned over many years.  We have that now.  We have a good deal of corporate memory.  I worked with Mr. Walsh on a bypass 25 years ago.  We shared the same desk on site.  Many people in TII have been there through the bad days and good days.  We cannot get everything right.  If we did it would be impossible or we would not be trying hard enough.  It is hard to get everything right in civil engineering.  There are always new risks and things we have to figure out.  Things are mapped through a site like services, for example.  We try to deal with the services that we find when we do site investigation.  To deal with services we have to have them mapped.  When we go on site we find services that were neither mapped nor found during site investigation.  It is all unseen.  It is not like building a house where there is a small footprint.  We have a huge linear footprint.<\/p> <p>  Another thing that is of great benefit to us - I have to acknowledge this - is our partnerships with the local authorities.  That has been critical to the success of the work we have done during the past 20 years, as has the work we did with the IFA and the farming community in developing a code of practice.  We developed the code of practice with the IFA and agreed it with Government and the IFA.  That paid major dividends with co-operation from landowners.  They allowed us to go on site to do surveys.  They moved cattle when we wanted to do something on site.  We got fantastic co-operation from the farming community.  Without that I would say the roads programme would have lasted a further two or three years and would have cost a further &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million.  I am sure there are other things.<\/p> <p>  This does not happen overnight.  We learn and bring good stuff forward.  When we start a big project or venture we start off by going over the lessons learned and how we can apply them.  Dunkettle has all the hallmarks of all of these things in one location.  There was one slip-up.  We had rainfall in November 2015 or 2016.  Half a lane got flooded in the tunnel and it brought Cork to a standstill.  Public transport could not move.  People could not get to the airport.  People could not get home from work or schools.  When 2 m of road width was removed from the equation on a dual carriageway, it caused chaos.  Committee members can see how sensitive the location is.  We could rush into this.  We could have someone coming on site now but we would find all those problems.  It is better not to put in an adversarial non-collaborative way of working.  We may save money upfront and a small amount of time mar dhea, but we would pay for it in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1563318000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>That is understood.

Why is TII waiting until now to have the negotiations?  I am led to believe that there was stalling on the project.  The issues arose back at the beginning of January.

I imagine that can be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#EE01500","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1563318000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I am happy to take that question, because I know Mr. Moran is deeply invested in it.  I have the opportunity for a little more objectivity.<\/p> <p>  There is one thing I am keen to clarify.  There is no negotiation.  It is not a negotiation that is occurring as part of the contract.  It is important to point that out.  A process is clearly mapped out.  The contractors and designers work in collaboration with our people on site to seek to identify a design that meets the employer's requirements.  We then develop the methodologies of working and traffic management and we do all the site investigations.<\/p> <p>  There were several references to statutory undertakers and moving of services.  Bord G&aacute;is, Waterways Ireland and Irish Water are involved.  When they are faced with discussing with a contractor how to move a particular service, it becomes a far more real conversation.  We have to go into the detail of it and what exactly is required has to be fleshed out.  That all takes time.  A great deal has been achieved in the past year.  I would not like to give the impression that there has been any delay in that regard.  There has not.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, the contractor has to get the cost projections right.  I can comment without exposing anything in terms of the confidential nature of the contract.  Deputy Buckley asked about the target cost and how that works.  I can give some explanation on that without breaching any confidentiality clause because it is down to the principle of the contract.  Basically, when the target cost is set - it must be set by agreement - that becomes the figure against which the performance of the contractor is measured.  The contract requires that the contractor be paid costs plus an overhead.  At the original tendering, that overhead was bid.  The contractor gets costs and overheads.  If the costs are below the target, as agreed, then there is a sharing of the benefit.  The sharing in this contract is 80% for the taxpayer and 20% for the contractor.  If the costs go above the target, there is a pain element for the contractor set at 60%.  There is a guaranteed maximum to the taxpayer.  If we go 25% above the target, the contractor carries all the cost.  Thus, the contractor must be careful.<\/p><p>In fairness, the contractor is meticulous, as it has to work through every location.  I cannot over-emphasise the detail involved.  Every location on the job has to be identified, and the contractor has to get crew, materials, and plant into that location, which could then be stuck there until they can be retrieved.  How does the contractor price that, or establish what its costs would be?  Final figures on that have been coming in over a period of time, and we are not breaching any confidentiality in saying that.  I do not know from where the impression that the project is behind time is coming.  When we went to the Government contracts committee for construction originally, we were told that this was a four-year, or 210-week, contract and that the first two years were regarded as stage one.  We are just over one year into it, so the impression that it is behind schedule is wrong.  Granted, we thought we might get it done quicker, but when one gets into the detail, these things cannot be shortcutted.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019071700002#EE01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1563318000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Mr. Walsh mentioned that it was a four-year contract.

People may have expected us to get there a bit sooner but we are on target and stage one is where we should be at this point in time.  There may have been some confusion as people saw us walking away, or being drawn away, from the site from the first quarter of the year until now, but that was always part of the process.
