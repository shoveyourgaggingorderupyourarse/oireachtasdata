As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.  As the Deputy is aware, the operation of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann services, including the new timetables on the DART, is a matter for the company with oversight by the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p>  <p>  One of the features of Dublin's future transport infrastructure that is proposed in the NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area 2016-2035 is implementation of the full DART expansion programme.  The DART expansion programme is a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin, with all the lines linked and connected.  While interlinked, the projects will also have benefits as stand-alone projects.  The National Development Plan, NDP, 2018-2027 includes delivery of the priority elements of the overall DART expansion programme.<\/p>  <p>  Also, by optimising the delivery of both passenger and network benefits through a large NDP capital investment that builds first on optimising the existing rail infrastructure, there should also be better value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the DART expansion programme and the move to a ten-minute frequency for DART services, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann introduced a new timetable on Sunday, 9 September to provide for enhanced DART frequency.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that the new timetable provides for a 28% increase in overall DART capacity and moves from 156 services per day to 195 services per day.  The company also indicated that the more frequent off-peak DART was introduced as a direct response to market research which showed greater demand for off-peak services.<\/p>  <p>  As sometimes occurs when new timetables are introduced, some teething issues arise that need to be reviewed and adjusted in order to ensure that the new arrangements reasonably address customers&rsquo; needs.  I understand that while the vast majority of this new timetable has provided a much enhanced service to DART commuters now and enables the provision of additional off-peak commuter services from December of this year, some capacity issues have arisen.  I am assured that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is working with the NTA to iron out those problems.<\/p>  <p>  The main issue that has arisen is around capacity on the northside of Dublin, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has responded swiftly to customer concerns by scheduling additional morning peak services from Portmarnock and Clongriffin.<\/p>  <p>  From Monday, 17 September there has been a 7.29 a.m. service from Portmarnock station to Pearse station and a service from Portmarnock to Bray.  Clongriffin has had an additional service provided by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann at 7.45 a.m. which runs from Clongriffin to Bray.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, with these further services now added by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Portmarnock now has the same number of peak morning services as it had before the timetable change and Clongriffin has one extra.<\/p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that it believes that these changes will address the frequency concerns from passengers from Portmarnock and Clongriffin and the capacity issues that have arisen particularly at DART stations such as Harmonstown and Killester.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900003#A00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537349400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am hardly surprised the Minister is not taking responsibility because that is a general trend of his.  He Minister described teething problems.  Charlie Weston tweeted this morning that he takes the train every morning and it has not been on time since 9 September.  The Minister alluded to DART frequency, with trains now arriving every ten minutes, but there are shorter trains so there is no increase in capacity.  This is at a time when, as a country, we are failing to meet our emission targets and are trying to encourage people to migrate from their cars to public transport.<\/p>  <p>  Can I ask the Minister's opinion on the example of a commuter from Mullingar?  The person said they used to get the former 7.31 a.m. train from Mullingar, which got them into work for 9 a.m., but which now leaves 15 minutes earlier and is scheduled to arrive five minutes sooner than the current train.  The train for the person's return journey leaves at 5.10 p.m. and arrives in Mullingar ten minutes later.  We have a situation where the busiest train in the morning is leaving 15 minutes earlier to arrive five minutes sooner while in the evening, it takes ten minutes longer to get home.  That is an extra 20 minutes a day for a commuter who pays &euro;3,600 per annum for the benefit of that service.<\/p>  <p>  When was the last time Irish Rail purchased rolling stock and when will that rolling stock be delivered?

It would be wrong for me to step in and say that Deputy Troy has made representations and that I want to ensure his particular area is looked after in that way.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I sympathise if the passengers in his area are being discommoded by these changes.

One of the features of this change in the DART expansion is that the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have been extremely flexible.  One of the qualities of a good transport service is that when measures of this sort are introduced, as for example with the Luas, one is prepared to be flexible in the face of passenger movements and changes, and this is what has happened.<\/p>  <p>  My guess is that in the case of Mullingar, which the Deputy mentioned, it will come under the same sort of criteria and scrutiny and will get similar responses to the one regarding Clongriffin and Portmarnock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900004#B00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537350000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I used Mullingar as an example and at the outset I listed every commuter line that is experiencing serious disruption.

The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant county or city council, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the council.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for road improvement projects would have been considered as part of the specific improvement, strategic, regional and local road grant schemes.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant that these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.<\/p>  <p>  The national development plan provides for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason, there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the specific and strategic grant programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the specific and strategic grant programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.

Driving licences allow people to drive but they are also widely used as proof of identity in other circumstances.  It is a core component of the driver licensing system that the identity of applicants has to be verified.  The Government's policy is that identity for applicants for licences should be verified to what is called the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, SAFE 2 standard.  It would not be acceptable to issue driving licences to some people only if they meet this standard of ID verification while allowing others to receive a licence without meeting this standard.  I appreciate that some asylum seekers will not be able to verify their ID to this level.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, we have to consider what will happen if an asylum seeker receives a driving licence and is subsequently turned down for asylum.  It will be necessary to have a mechanism in place so that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as the national driver licensing authority, can be notified immediately and can cancel the licence.<\/p>  <p>  I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, regarding these issues.

I welcome the Minister's confirmation today that he is reviewing this matter.  There are a number of potential difficulties that he must overcome.  I ask that we put a tight timeline on this.

Identity verification is difficult.  I am as enthusiastic as he is to resolve this problem and see that there will be no overriding obstacle to asylum seekers getting driving licences.  The key difficulty in issuing driving licences to asylum seekers, however, is identity verification.  Ireland has determined that the appropriate level of ID verification is the standard referred to as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, SAFE, level 2.  Asylum seekers come to the jurisdiction with a variety of documentation or, potentially, in some cases with no documentation at all.  Verification of ID to SAFE 2 level may be, practically speaking, impossible in some cases.  If we are considering issuing driving licences to asylum seekers then it would be possible to take one of the three positions.  It would make sense to issue licences only to asylum seekers whose ID would be verified to SAFE 2 standard.<\/p>  <p>  There is obviously also the problem of the post-refusal of asylum.  In cases where a person was refused asylum he or she would no longer have a right to remain in the jurisdiction.  It is surely arguable in such cases that the individual is no longer normally resident - one of the qualifications - and therefore no longer eligible to be issued with a licence.  A decision would then have to be made as to whether a driving licence issued to an asylum seeker should be cancelled if his or her application for asylum is rejected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900005#C01600","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537350600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>We will move on.

Shannon Airport is subject to very limited regulation by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which sets charges for access to certain terminal facilities in compliance with an EU directive on ground-handling services.  Unlike Dublin Airport, it is not subject to economic regulation.  In the case of Dublin Airport, the regulator sets the maximum passenger charge that can be levied on airlines for the use of airport facilities and services due to its dominance in the market.  Ireland's regional airports programme is intended to support necessary safety and security investments and activities by the smaller regional airports at Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford to enable them to continue to contribute to enhanced regional connectivity.  Under this programme, Exchequer funding is allocated through a number of schemes to cover capital and operational expenditure at those airports.  Passenger numbers at these small airports are less than 1 million per annum.  The support that is provided helps them to comply with international safety and security regulatory obligations.  There are no plans to extend this programme to other airports.<\/p>  <p>  Shannon Airport is a business within Shannon Group, which was established in 2014 following a Government decision to combine the airport with a restructured Shannon Development.  The purpose of the group is to promote and facilitate air transport and aviation services in and around Shannon Airport and to optimise the return on its land and property and on its shareholdings in subsidiary companies.  Shannon Group and its board, management and staff are to be commended for its achievements since then.  For example, it increased its passenger numbers by approximately 25% to 1.75 million in 2017.  It has increased its services and routes, successfully delivered the first phase of an investment programme in new and upgraded property solutions and increased its aviation cluster from approximately 40 companies with approximately 1,400 employees to approximately 60 companies with approximately 2,600 employees.  It has restructured its Shannon Heritage business, invested in its various sites, improved its product for tourists and won contracts for the management of other sites, including the GPO visitor centre and Newbridge House.  As Shannon Airport is a State-owned enterprise with a fully commercial mandate, it is not considered appropriate or necessary to bring it within the framework of the regional airports programme.  It is a matter for Shannon Airport to ensure it operates within its mandate as efficiently and effectively as possible so it can cover its capital investments and operational expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900006#D00700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537351200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  It is good to be discussing matters relating to the future of Shannon Airport on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The future of the airport is inextricably linked with the need for balanced regional development in the mid-west region and along the Atlantic economic corridor.  Shannon Airport is a key economic driver in the region.  Foreign direct investment companies see Shannon Airport as a critical piece of infrastructure that is central to the economic success of the region.  EU rules allow capital expenditure supports to be provided to airports that are used by fewer than 3 million passengers per annum.  The Irish Government gives no financial support to Shannon Airport, which is used by 1.7 million passengers per annum, but it provides support to smaller privately-owned regional airports for capital investment and operational matters, such as security requirements.  A policy change is needed to treat all airports outside Dublin on an equal basis.  If the Minister is sincere about the Project Ireland 2040 ambition to drive effective balanced regional development, he needs to make the case for policy change to ensure Shannon Airport receives equitable support.  In that regard, in 2017 the EU amended the general block exemption regulation, which allows airports of fewer than 3 million passengers to receive aid to be used for investment in safety and security.  I ask the Minister to consider looking at that regulation and implementing policy change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900006#D00800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1537351200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right when he says that this aid is restricted to safety and security.

This expenditure, which has not been accounted for in Shannon Group's financial forecasts, is likely to be approximately &euro;10 million and will present significant difficulties for the group.  The new hold baggage screening requirements are mandatory for all airports.  Shannon Airport will have to overcome the difficulty it is facing in this regard.  My officials are engaging with the Shannon Group to get a better understanding of all the elements relating to this issue.  Even if Shannon Airport were to be included in the regional airports funding programme, I am not sure whether funding for safety and security would really fulfil the current needs of the airport.

Project Ireland 2040 sets out a vision for attracting jobs to the regions and ensuring economic growth is distributed fairly.  IDA Ireland has regional targets for foreign direct investment.  I think Tourism Ireland should also have regional targets to ensure there is a fair distribution of visitors to Ireland through airports other than Dublin Airport, including Shannon Airport.  In 2016, some &euro;12.6 million was invested in marketing Ireland.  Approximately 95% of growth has occurred in the Dublin region, which gets 87% of the incoming traffic.  It would appear that the vast majority of the money is being spent in the Dublin region and not in the other regions.  I think there should be an examination of how the money being invested in marketing is dispersed across the other airports.  In my view, Shannon Airport is not getting a fair proportion of that funding.  I have two questions for the Minister.  How much money has been spent on marketing airports outside Dublin?

Recent data published by Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority, NTA, in the annual canal cordon report show an upward trend of cyclists crossing the canal which continued between 2016 and 2017, with numbers increasing by 3%.  There has been a steady year-on-year growth in the number of cyclists crossing the cordon since 2010.  In 2017, almost 12,500 cyclists crossed the cordon in the morning peak period.  This represents an increase of more than 150% when compared with 2006 and an increase of more than 57% in the past five years.  The Central Statistics Office has also published statistical information on cycling, including the national travel survey which illustrates the prevalence of cycling and the upward trends in cycling numbers.<\/p><p>Cycling numbers have shown a steady increase in recent years, which is one of the reasons I worked to secure a substantial multi-annual funding allocation for this area as part of budget 2018.  The increase I secured has allowed more than &euro;110 million of capital funding to be directly allocated to develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford in the period from 2018 to 2021.  The programme will provide safe alternative active travel routes that will help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.  Details of individual projects are managed by the NTA. <\/p><p>Over the same period, a further &euro;135 million capital funding is allocated for investment in sustainable urban transport projects.  These will include projects that will provide either direct or indirect improvements for urban cycling.  This programme builds on investment to date to deliver improvements in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the regional cities and the greater Dublin area.  It includes traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects, which will allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and will help relieve traffic congestion and therefore improve safety for cyclists. <\/p><p><i>Additional information not provided on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In addition to both these allocations, the considerable investment of approximately &euro;750 million for BusConnects that aims to reconfigure the bus network and infrastructure over the coming years will deliver the construction of significant new cycling facilities alongside bus routes.  The NTA calculates that BusConnects for Dublin will deliver more than 200 km of cycle lanes on the key radial routes into Dublin city centre.  This will provide safe cycling arrangements along these corridors, largely segregated from other traffic. <\/p><p>In addition to funding for the provision of infrastructure, my Department continues to be very active in promoting behavioural change to encourage more people to take up cycling and cycle safely.  As well as funding national initiatives such as Bike Week, my Department also provides funding to the NTA on an annual basis for the delivery of behavioural change programmes such as workplace and campus travel programmes and the green schools programmes.  My Department also engaged Cycling Ireland to develop a new national cycle training standard, Cycle Right, which was rolled out in January 2017 to approximately 15,000 primary school students.  My Department also supports the great work that is being done by the Road Safety Authority in the promotion of safe roads for all road users, including more vulnerable users such as cyclists and pedestrians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900007#E00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537351800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>While we all recognise there has been a substantial increase in the number of people commuting by bicycle, cyclists only account for 3% of commuters.

The DART expansion programme is a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin with all the lines linked and connected.  The estimated cost of the DART expansion programme is &euro;2 billion.  The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are in the process of defining an overall integrated schedule for the DART expansion programme with numerous projects to be completed by 2027.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, as part of the DART expansion programme and the move to a ten-minute frequency for DART services, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann introduced a new timetable on Sunday, 9 September to provide for enhanced DART frequency.  The new DART timetable involves increasing services between Bray and Howth Junction and Donaghmede from a 15 minute frequency to a ten-minute frequency, with the Howth Junction and Donaghmede to Howth and Malahide segments of the network improving from a 30 minute DART service to a 20 minute service.  The DART service from Greystones to Bray remains at a 30 minute frequency.<\/p>  <p>  Frequently, the introduction of new timetables gives rise to some teething issues that need to be addressed to improve the service for customers.  As I indicated in my response to the Deputy's earlier priority question, the main issue that has arisen with this timetable change relates to capacity on the north side of Dublin.  I am assured that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is working with the NTA to iron out those problems, and I am aware that as a direct response to customer feedback, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has introduced additional services which will particularly benefit those commuters in Portmarnock.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, with the two additional services now added by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Portmarnock now has the same number of peak morning services as it had before the timetable change and Clongriffin has one extra.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has stated that it believes that these changes will address the frequency concerns from customers from Portmarnock and Clongriffin and the capacity issues that have arisen, especially at DART stations such as Harmonstown and Killester.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900008#F00950","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537352400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>As the Minister says, Portmarnock now has the same numbers.

No one expects the Minister to micromanage Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and he was not asked to do that.

We have seen similar difficulties with the Luas in south Dublin.  These instances have been marked by the fact that where there were difficulties, the trains were switched back and restored.  In fact, the overcrowding which Deputy Clare Daly has addressed has in fact been sorted.  That is what a good train or bus operator should do.

The report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin and the main towns in north County Kildare is very complex and that it has been designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes from the city's suburbs taking people into the city centre but with very few orbital routes.  Also, recent and proposed improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to bus services in order to gain the full potential from the improvements.  As the Deputy is aware, the city and the greater Dublin area, including its main towns such as Maynooth and Celbridge, are growing and changing, as are the bus journeys people are taking.  The report identifies four key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals; and grow suburban feeder networks. <\/p><p>BusConnects Dublin aims to overhaul the current bus system in the wider Dublin region by building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus routes to make passenger bus journeys faster, predictable and reliable; completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide passengers with a more efficient network, connecting more places and carrying more people; developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit and debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and making payment much more convenient for the travelling public; implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up passenger boarding times; revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure; allowing seamless movement of passengers between different public transport services without financial penalty; implementing a new bus livery providing a modern look and feel to the new bus system; rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information and increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and transitioning - starting now - to a new bus fleet using low-emission vehicle technologies<\/p><p>Against this context, the NTA is progressing the roll-out of BusConnects, commencing in Dublin.  BusConnects Dublin provides the foundation for this overall transport system, with the revised bus system projected to carry the majority of passengers across the region and provide key linkages to serve the needs of Dublin into the future.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>While there will be concerns about any change, these strategies will deliver many benefits for the customer: much simpler city services; a much simpler fare structure and provide more frequent all-day services through new and frequent orbital services, interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines.  Under the proposals, an overall increase in services of 27% is expected, which, as far as customers are concerned, can only be good.  The NTA estimates that, of people who currently have a direct service to the city centre, 92% will continue to have such a service under the new bus network proposals.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the NTA, supported by Dublin Bus, has embarked on a process of full public consultation on these bus proposals involving local brochures, local face to face events organised at various locations around the city and the surrounding region, digital imaging of the network, online surveys and consultation with user groups.  They are both listening to people who have suggestions to make on how these plans can be made even better.  The public consultation process will run until 28 September and presents a great opportunity for people to have their say before the plans are finalised by the NTA.  The NTA expects to publish the findings of the public consultation phase before year end. <\/p><p>The NTA understands the issue of interchange is more difficult for elderly people and people with disabilities.  Accordingly, it intends to make changes between services as seamless as possible.  It is planning that each key interchange location will have a bus shelter, seating, lighting and passenger information.  Where bus routes intersect at a junction, the bus stops will be moved as close as possible to the junction to minimise any walking required during the bus interchange and pedestrian crossings will be added, where necessary.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that BusConnects will deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors travelling between the city and surrounding regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900009#G00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537353000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.

Will the Minister make a particular effort to ensure people who are generally in the middle of the towns or close-by will continue to have available to them the services to which they have become accustomed?

As stated in response to questions from other Deputies, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in for the national roads programme but I will be as helpful as I can within that context.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design and operation of individual roads is a matter for the relevant road authority in relation to local and regional roads or for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned in relation to national roads.  Consequently, the TII and the local authorities have responsibility for signs and road markings in accordance with the traffic signs manual, TSM, which is issued under my direction as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The TSM sets out the standards for signing and road markings to be used on all roads in the country.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific question raised by the Deputy, I understand from the TII, the N25 route was remarked under the national road delineation programme in 2015.  Road markings on each road route are designed from end to end by a contracted competent team in accordance with the TSM.  Any non-compliant markings or markings that do not accord with the provisions of the manual are removed as part of the remarking contract.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals regarding safety improvement works are matters which are normally developed in the first instance by the relevant local authority, in this case Waterford City and County Council.  For the TII to consider fully any such proposals relating to national roads, the local authority is required to carry out an analysis of the collision history at the location and design an appropriate scheme to deal with any safety issues identified.  In addition, the local authority is required to carry out an economic appraisal of the proposal, cost the scheme fully, prepare a feasibility report, and prioritise the scheme relative to other works proposed by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  There are no specific road markings or arrows for so-called turn-offs for residential access.  All junctions are marked in accordance with the provisions of the TSM, as I have just outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the aim is to have consistency of approach across the country and it is the responsibility of each local authority, in conjunction with the TII with regard to national roads, to ensure that the appropriate standards, as set out in the TSM, are adhered to.  Adhering to a consistent approach to road signs and markings delivers better safety results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900010#H01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537353600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply, which explains the problem.

The Minister has rightly said that the delineation was carried out in 2015.  Unfortunately the delineation was very good in parts but not as good in others.

There are eight houses on the road, called Kilmoyemoge East, which leads onto another road that has 100 houses.

We wish safety to everyone else.<\/p>  <p>  Among those responding to this weather challenge are members of the Defence Forces.  They will do so with dedication and commitment, as they do in everything.  The country is rightly proud of our Defence Forces, how they serve and protect us and our world and how they have contributed over many years - 60 years was marked earlier this year - in Lebanon, Syria and the Golan Heights, to mention but a few.  Irish soldiers, naval forces and Air Corps personnel are valued across the globe, and we all admire them for their work at home as well as their dedication and expertise.  We remember with pride their participation in the centenary of the 1916 Rising, particularly given what that participation brought to the occasion.<\/p>  <p>  However, compliments and commendations do not put meals on tables.  Despite many debates in the D&aacute;il and a report commissioned by the University of Limerick on the Defence Forces, little to nothing has been done by the Government about the concerns affecting them.  Members of the Defence Forces are men and women who have the same costs as the rest of us but are now finding it impossible to rear families, get mortgages and tackle day-to-day costs because they are serving our country.  A large proportion of Defence Forces members have had to sign up for family income supplement, or the working family payment as it is now known.<\/p>  <p>  Defence Forces personnel are leaving on a weekly basis.  Expertise is being lost to the State and colleagues are losing colleagues because the private sector is putting much better offers on the table.

In her response, the Minister will say that a recruitment campaign is under way, but she will not say how many are leaving on a weekly or monthly basis and therefore nullifying the recruitment campaign.

At home and overseas, the men and women of our Defence Forces serve Ireland with absolute distinction.  The Defence Forces are part of a bedrock underpinning the safety and security of every person in this country and others further afield.  It would be understating it to say that the Government values each and every member and the roles he or she carries out, be it peacekeeping or supporting other State agencies at home.  For example, the Defence Forces are today helping the ESB because of the adverse weather conditions.<\/p>  <p>  It is for these reasons that the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC, to examine the question of recruitment that the Deputy mentioned as well as retention issues in the Defence Forces, of which I will say we are well aware just in case the Deputy thinks we are not.  The process is under way, submissions have been made and the commission is engaging with individual serving members.  This is just one element of the efforts to improve Defence Forces members' pay and conditions.  As with other areas of our public services, members of the Defence Forces are benefitting from pay increases due under the pay agreements and revised pay scales for post-2013 recruits.  These have already been implemented.  Those increases range from approximately 6.2% to 7.4%.  They are also benefitting from the restoration to pre-FEMPI levels for everyone earning under &euro;70,000.  The first 1% increase became payable on 1 January 2018.  The second increase is due to be applied on 1 October.  The 5% in allowances that were cut by FEMPI legislation because of the economic and financial position that the State was in during the precarious years from 2010 until very recently are scheduled to be recovered soon.<\/p>  <p>  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, we accept that the turnover rate within the Defence Forces is probably going to be higher than in some of our other agencies.  I hope I will surprise the Deputy by saying that I acknowledge the figure of 8% is too high.  For that reason, we have organised recruitment and retention measures to be implemented, for example, addressing the work-life balance, conducting a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces, reviewing the contract of services for enlisted personnel in the context of capability requirements and appropriate age profiles, and developing and expanding the options for the direct entry of specialists and the re-entry of former members with the required skill sets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900012#K01500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537354800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Defence Forces personnel on duty for the papal visit were given a paltry amount compared with others who did overtime.  This is why there is a parade today.

Members of the Defence Forces and their representative organisations have consistently been sidelined in public service pay negotiations and are excluded from trade union membership or affiliation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  They are legally prevented from engaging in public demonstrations or protests about their terms and conditions, which is why they have to rely on their representative organisations to raise the issues, or their family members and former members to parade through this city.  The Government has taken full advantage of their loyalty, as a former brigadier general has said.  He has outlined that the bond between members of the Defence Forces and the State has been broken.  I recently met the representative organisations of the Defence Forces.  They confirmed to me that there was chaos in the Defence Forces, which are haemorrhaging members, not just long-serving members but also many new recruits.  This is exerting extra pressure on morale which is already low.  Morale is a foundation any army, navy or air corps has to have.  The Government is well aware of this and was made aware of it before the University of Limerick report in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Recently the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, was forced to go to the High Court to vindicate the rights of members of the Defence Forces in the context of the provisions of the working time directive.  They were forced to go to the European Committee on Social Rights to vindicate the right to engage in collective bargaining on working terms and conditions.  That members of the Defence Forces have had to fight the Government tooth and nail, both at home and elsewhere in Europe, to have basic rights ensured is a disgrace.  It is even more disgraceful that the Government has still not taken action to implement court decisions.  The Defence Forces are expected to lose another 700 members this year, with many moving to the private sector for better pay and working conditions.  Since members of the Defence Forces are unappreciated by this and the last Government, the State has had to outsource many services and some of work that was done, for example, by the air ambulance service, which is penny wise and pound foolish.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister explain the reason for the delay in the Department making a submission to the Public Service Pay Commission?

We take them very seriously, as we take the pride in the Defence Forces.  I will again say what I said to Deputy Dara Calleary.  The Defence Forces are the bedrock which underpins the safety and security of both society and the nation.  I cannot overemphasise that point which is evidently true.  That is why the Government has taken significant actions in the past few years, through improvements in pay under the Lansdowne Road agreement; further increases over the lifetime of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020; the Public Service Pay Commission being tasked with providing a retention and recruitment action plan to make sure the concerns that have been raised by those who remain in the Defence Forces will be addressed; and recruitment to bring numbers which have been depleted by 470, as Deputy Dara Calleary said, back up to make sure we will have a full complement of men and women who provide for the security and safety of people both in this country and abroad.  The Minister of State will accept the submission from the organisers of today's parade.  We will look at it very carefully and respond once the submission's objectives or recommendations have been analysed.<\/p>  <p>  There is no delay in making the submission.  It is being worked on and, when it is finished, will be presented to the body.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on the working time directive because I do not have a response about it.  It is fundamental that every single man, woman and child in this country has pride in the Defence Forces and what they do to protect peace and provide for the safety and security of Irish people both here and abroad.  We have had difficulties with pay in the past few years but not without good reason.  Every single public and civil servant had his or her pay cut for a number of years because of the economic crash.  Thankfully, we are in a position where we are able to unravel the cuts and bring forward new pay and stability agreements for the years ahead.  It is because the economy is recovering that we can do this and it is because we value and want to retain personnel in the Defence Forces that we have an action plan for retention and recruitment to ensure they will be at full capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900013#L00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537355400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister on the pride Irish society has in the Defence Forces, but this is not just about pride.

Current recruitment levels will not fill the vacancies.  The vacancies are causing a huge increase in the workload of remaining members, which means extra shifts, longer hours, not seeing their families, not enough hours between rosters, having to sleep in tents in the rain, as we saw in the Phoenix Park when personnel of other emergency services were being appreciated and able to go home or accommodated in safe and secure accommodation.  Why would anybody join the Defence Forces knowing they would face the prospect of having to sleep in a car outside the barracks?  Why would one volunteer for duty overseas when one would have to take suspect medication which has left colleagues debilitated or when one cannot afford a home or rent, despite the fact that one is doing one of most dangerous jobs in the State?

We are lucky as a country that we can recognise with pride the people in our Defence Forces and are able to pay them effectively.  In addition, the Government is investing in capital equipment and platforms, including those that increase the force's protection, such as armoured personnel carriers and in the building of infrastructure.

Throughout the country there have been large, angry meetings in response to the proposals as communities are opposed to the closures.  Similarly, in Dublin city and the greater Dublin region there have been meetings in response to the proposed BusConnects project, which has been aptly renamed, \"BusDisconnects\".  The meetings have not been called by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  They have been called by residents' associations, councillors and Deputies.  More than 400 people attended meetings in Crumlin and Swords.  More than 300 people attended a meeting in Drimnagh.  The Greenhills residents' association also called a meeting.  Last night there was a meeting in Perrystown where more than 150 people attended.  Residents' associations in Terenure Road and Whitehall also called meetings.<\/p>  <p>  The existing cross-city bus service has evolved over decades.  It goes into estates and there is excellent connectivity across the city.  I accept buses might meander a bit around estates but they connect communities, which is the crucial point.  It is a public service.  This so-called plan for the bus service is a disaster.  In the constituency I represent, there will be a withdrawal from estates of the following routes: 18, 17, 150, 123, 122, 68, 69, 13, 9 and 15A.  Hospitals are losing connectivity.  The 27B and 17A have been withdrawn from Beaumont Hospital.  The 123 is being withdrawn from St. James's Hospital and the 47 will no longer go by St. Vincent's University Hospital.  The changes will affect older citizens in particular, as well as the disabled and schoolgoing children.  One community has calculated that it will take three buses to get their children to St. Louis school in Rathmines.  People with health concerns involving their knees, heart, lungs and visual impairment will be affected.<\/p>  <p>  It was said that no one would be more than 400 m away from a bus stop, yet after a public meeting in Drimnagh on Thursday night we worked out that up to 43% of residents would not be within the specified 400 m range.  There is a need for a review of public transport in the city and outer suburbs.  The aim of the review should be to increase not decrease services for local communities.  At a very minimum we should maintain existing services.  The reality is the Dublin Bus fleet has been cut from 1,160 to 1,000 in the past ten years and buses now carry 27 million extra passengers.  This review must be done with proper consultation with service users.  There should be full consultation with those who provide the service, rather than management, as they know the service.  They are the people who will make sensible suggestions as to how the service could be made more efficient and more suited to the needs of communities.<\/p>  <p>  The privatisation of 10% of bus services will go ahead even though Dublin Bus tendered 5% less.  A new tendering process will be put in place.  There is a belief that the seven new transport spines will be used to tender out the services to private operators.

Reports show that approximately 70% of people travelling into Dublin city each morning do so by sustainable transport and public transport, which is very welcome.  More than half of public transport trips are by bus and there are 136 million passenger journeys every single year.  All the NTA is proposing to do is to improve those services to allow people to spend more time with their families, learn a foreign language or do whatever it is people choose to do in their spare time instead of spending hours on public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The one point on which I agree with Deputy Joan Collins is that there is a need for a review.  That is exactly what is intended.  We have a need for full public consultation, which is exactly what is planned.  In June, the NTA published a discussion document that focused on some 230 km of continuous bus lanes across 16 core corridors or bus routes.  That is expected to achieve time savings of between 40% and 50% on journeys.  It is also the case that the routes and options are indicative at this stage.  It is up to the NTA to conduct public consultation meetings following the publication of the public consultation report in July, and consultation meetings are being held the length and breadth of the city and in my area of County Meath where Dublin Bus looks after some residents.  The purpose of the consultation meetings is to hear the objections, concerns or praise for what the NTA is trying to do but, more important, the NTA can feed the information back into what will ultimately be the end design.  The end design may not be remotely like the initial public consultation document.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that all of the views raised at the public meetings described by Deputy Joan Collins are brought to the attention of the NTA so that when we get a final draft document to appraise and approve, collectively and publicly, we will have a better infrastructure for the public transport network in order that people spend much less time going to and from work, college or school every single day and that people will have a better work-life balance because they will be spending more of their free time doing what they want, as opposed to sitting on a bus in traffic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900014#M00500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1537356000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>When the Minister drills down into \"BusDisconnects\" she will see that is not what is happening.

With BusConnects there would be a combination of F1s, F2s and G4s, giving a total of eight buses for an area where it has been proposed to halve the routes.  The NTA has not carried out a proper consultation.  Meetings have not been advertised widely.  Public representatives such as councillors and Deputies have advertised the proposed changes.  There has been no consultation in Raheny or Drimnagh and that is the case across the city.  I urge the Government to scrap the proposal.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should do that.  He has the power under section 26.  There should be proper consultation.

As the Minister may be aware, since the first week in June of this year all scheduled operations at Kerry University Hospital have been cancelled.  The only operations that take place are emergency operations.  To put it simply, if a person is waiting for a hip or knee operation, or any other scheduled operation, he or she must continue to wait.<\/p><p>That is a disgrace at a time when I am very worried about the future status of the hospital, in spite of assurances given at a meeting last week that it would retain its university hospital status.  The departure of an ever-increasing number of consultants and what I consider to be the continuous downgrading by HSE management of the hospital leave me extremely worried.<\/p> <p> I take the opportunity to compliment the hard-working staff in the emergency department and the hospital wards who do everything they can to help their patients.  Those who avail of the services provided in the hospital are grateful to and thankful for the individuals working in it.  However, I have marched with nurses and doctors working in emergency departments who have stated they want the Government to wake up and realise the pressure they are under.  I have been in such departments late at night and early in the morning.  During the summer recess I spent a lot of time in the departments because I wanted to have first-hand knowledge of what was going on in them.

The buck stops with the Minister and the Government, not the HSE.  The hiding behind layers of bureaucracy must end.  People must take responsibility.  The Minister for Health must take responsibility for the fact that people are endlessly waiting for operations.  He must sit down with the heads of other Departments and discuss what can be done to tackle the problem.  I wish to give an example.  Why is it that a person waiting for a tonsillectomy must wait three years for the procedure to be carried out in this state and that I can arrange for the procedure to be carried out for a person who presents today with that requirement in Belfast in the first couple of weeks of November?  For God's sake, this is not Outer Mongolia or some such place when it comes to health services.  We should not be telling people that their tonsils will be fixed in three years time.

What steps are being taken to ensure the framework that was agreed, whereby there would be a standard charge, is adhered to?

It was been voted down twice by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, yet three times I have remained hopeful that they would reach some sort of epiphany and realise the need to incorporate these rights into our Constitution.  We stand today amid a devastating housing and homelessness crisis, a crippling two-tier health system and an escalating trolley crisis with the education system not far behind in these gloomy times.  These three vital components in our society are under siege by Fine Gael's privatisation agenda and the continuation of Fianna Fail's privatisation of our vital public services.  Housing, health and education and workers' rights, among many others, should be viewed as fundamental human rights, but to Fine Gael they are products that people can access based on their ability to pay.<\/p><p>When I first introduced this Bill in 2014, we were astonished at the emerging crisis, particularly in housing and health.  In 2014, according to Focus Ireland, there were 2,580 people in homelessness, 20 of whom were in my own constituency of Donegal.  Today, there are nearly 10,000 people in homelessness, not taking into account the changes in the way the Government collects statistics, which has reduced the numbers to its own benefit.  The number is in fact far higher than that.  According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation's Trolley and Ward Watch, 7,942 people were on trolleys and waiting in wards.  Today, that figure has increased by 22% compared with the 2014 average.<\/p><p>It is clear that Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, the establishment parties, have paved the way for greater outsourcing and privatisation of State services, inevitably curbing the rights of individuals and targeting the most vulnerable people in society.  My Bill seeks to reverse this ideology by preserving the defendable rights of individuals.  These include housing, including prioritising social housing to address the current housing crisis; a universal right to healthcare based on need and not ability to pay; greater protection of workers' rights to correct the imbalance of power in favour of employees and unions; equal access to education reflecting diversity in our society; a right to social protection in line with cost of living; and incorporation of the living wage, among many others, which time and time again, the people have called for.<\/p><p>The protection of economic, social and cultural rights continues to grow around the world.  For example, the right to healthcare is included in 133 constitutions, while the right to join a trade union is included in 152.  A total of 136 recognise the right to work and\/or the state's duty to provide work.  Furthermore, the right to housing is included in 81 constitutions, while the right to culture is incorporated in 141.<\/p> <p> Economic, social and cultural rights present a framework to undermine existing systems of injustice and inequality which are pervasive in today&rsquo;s society as basic human rights are eroded consistently by private sector interests which, unfortunately, the Government promotes.  Furthermore, economic, social and cultural rights can provide a legitimate framework for addressing climate change and ensuring the Government will facilitate a fair and just transition to a low carbon economy.  Climate change is a huge impediment to the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights.  Therefore, they are interlinked.<\/p> <p> I also feel the need to engage in a bit of myth busting.  A key tenet in the protection of economic, social and cultural rights is the notion of \"progressive realisation\" as defined in Article 2(1) and reflects the fact that it may not be possible to achieve full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights within a short period, particularly when resources are limited.  Progressive realisation is seen as a necessary flexible device, reflecting the realities of the real world and the difficulties involved for any country in ensuring full realisation of economic, social and cultural rights.  Most importantly, it establishes obligations on states parties to achieve full realisation of the rights as contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and that a state can only readjust them in reaction to an economic crisis if the necessary protections required for vulnerable and disadvantaged populations, in particular, are taken into account and where it is justified.<\/p> <p> Economic, social and cultural rights are becoming increasingly necessary in the Irish context, particularly after a decade long recession from which a housing crisis has emerged.  As Ireland experiences unprecedented numbers of families living in emergency accommodation, questions are being raised about how the provision of housing can be adequately and consistently provided for in an economy with frequent cycles of boom and bust, while not remaining at the mercy of ideological preferences as determined by the Government of the day.  Greater protection of economic, social and cultural rights in the Constitution would provide the necessary anchor for rights such as those to housing, health and education to be provided for on the basis of need at all times, even amid times of economic or political turbulence.  When it comes to budgetary measures, the Government would have to justify reasons for the allocation of resources not intended for the administration of economic, social and cultural rights.  If a justification was not favourable, an individual could defend his or her rights in the courts and thereby hold the Government to account for its decision-making.<\/p> <p> Together with the progressive realisation tenet, the referendum Bill would ensure the economic, social and cultural rights of individuals were balanced against the available resources of the State, regardless of ideological persuasion or the state of the economy at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900018#Q01400","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537359000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900019#R00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1537359000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900019#R00300","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537359000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537359000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900019#R00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1537359000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &quot;Go dt&oacute;gfar an Bille in am Comhalta&iacute;

While the Taoiseach addressed some of these issues during Leaders' Questions yesterday, I can perhaps add some additional detail to the record of the House today.  The Garda Commissioner has issued a statement on the incident referred to and we all now have a greater level of clarity as to what took place.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that, following the making of an order by the High Court, a small number of community garda&iacute; were present to keep the peace.  They were present to facilitate a peaceful protest and they were present to facilitate the enforcement of a High Court order.  Garda&iacute; were not involved in the vacation of the premises, which had been illegally occupied.  A private security firm acted for the owner of the premises on foot of the High Court order.  The law and procedures governing the execution of court orders are contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and the Rules of Court which have been made under them.<\/p><p>Any dispute concerning the enforcement of a court order is solely a matter for the courts.  Accordingly, the persons involved in the execution of the High Court order are not licensable by the Private Security Authority at present.  I must advise the House, however, that my officials are currently examining the law governing this area and I am giving the matter further consideration.<\/p> <p> As An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has stated, a small number of community garda&iacute; were initially present.  As the situation evolved, they were supplemented by more garda&iacute;, and then a small number of officers from the public order unit were deployed.  To be clear, the purpose of the Garda presence was to keep the peace and facilitate a peaceful protest and the enforcement of an order of the High Court.  I know there was some disquiet about members of the public order unit wearing hoods.  The Garda Commissioner has said they should have been worn in conjunction with helmets.  Members will be familiar with public order police around the world wearing helmets in the course of their policing duties.<\/p> <p> It is a sad fact and a worrying development that garda&iacute;, particularly those who undertake public order policing, are frequently personally targeted and subjected to vile abuse and threats, particularly online.  At the protest, garda&iacute; were subject to sustained abuse, including in one incident racist abuse.  I condemn this behaviour and I am sure all Members of the House will do likewise.  Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated, but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur in the first instance.  I appeal to those involved in such protest to recognise that garda&iacute; simply doing their jobs should not be targeted in this way.  This message needs to go out from all sides of the House, and I ask colleagues to join me in reinforcing it.<\/p> <p> A small number of people were arrested at the protest for public order offences.  As these matters are subject to ongoing Garda inquiries, the House will appreciate it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them.  I note, however, Commissioner Harris's recent statement on the protest and I understand he has requested a report from the assistant commissioner, Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, to see what lessons can be learned from the event.  I also note the Policing Authority will pursue the matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> Everyone in this House will agree that the right to protest is a fundamental right in any democracy and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, this right must also be exercised peacefully and with respect for the rights of others.  In this context, we must not lose sight of the fact that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na present were enforcing the law of the land in what were very difficult and tense circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900020#X00700","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537359900,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The Minister says garda&iacute; should not be targeted by protesters.

I am sure he has better things to do than engage in incidents such as this.  We would, however, like to know who took these decisions and whether anyone will be held responsible for them.  I know the Commissioner is having his own investigation into the matter.  I know the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, cannot carry out a section 102 investigation without the Commissioner or the Minister authorising it, just as GSOC was not allowed to investigate the Corrib gas incident.

The masked men from the private security firm did not have identification numbers either and there was nothing to identify who they were working for or what they were doing there.  This incident was very sinister.  I stand with my colleagues in saying I do not condone violence.

The reason they contacted me was that they were particularly anxious about the fact that the plan for MetroLink which was published a number of months ago included a proposal to demolish their apartment block.  It is important to point out that the apartment block comprises 70 homes.  It also contains at ground level the Dublin City Council Markievicz leisure centre which is used widely by people in the locality.  More than &euro;1 million was spent on its refurbishment in late 2015 and early 2016.  It is apparent, therefore, that this is not just some small location that is being proposed for demolition in order to facilitate a major infrastructural project.  It is a large location and its demolition is going to greatly inconvenience people.<\/p>  <p>  The people I met were generally young couples who had recently purchased apartments in College Gate.  There are also many apartments within College Gate that are owned by Dublin City Council and which are rented to tenants.  It is astonishing, at a time when there is a major housing crisis in Dublin, that a statutory body could recommend that an apartment block containing 70 homes be demolished.  The Minister will be aware, like everyone else in the House, that when major infrastructural developments are proposed, it will, of course, be the case that, on occasion, individuals will be inconvenienced.  Land will sometimes have to be compulsorily purchased.  On other occasions, buildings may have to be demolished.  However, what is being proposed is outside the norm.  I say this for two reasons.  First, it is extraordinary that a statutory body would propose to demolish 70 homes in the centre of the city at the time of such an extraordinary housing crisis.  Second, the proposed demolition of the apartment block is not actually necessary.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, state they need to demolish it in order to construct a top-down station for the MetroLink at Tara Street, but there are many other locations in the vicinity which would be suitable.  I know that the residents made a proposal or submission to the NTA and TII which stated the well known location of Apollo House could properly be used for the purpose of constructing the new underground station.<\/p>  <p>  The second part of this Topical Issue matter relates to the fact that, although the MetroLink will be a very welcome addition to the infrastructure of Dublin, some sensible political thought needs to be put into the route outlined by TII and the NTA.  The proposal is that there will be an underground route from Dublin Airport into the centre of the city - a perfectly sensible idea - and that then when it reaches Charlemont it will come above ground.  The Luas line is going to be dug up from Charlemont the whole way out to Cherrywood and replaced by the MetroLink.  The Minister is well aware that there are certain parts of the city that are very poorly served by public transport infrastructure, particularly rail transport infrastructure.  The areas that really need rail transport infrastructure are in the south west of the city and include areas in my constituency such as Harold's Cross and Rathgar and also areas on the way out to Firhouse and Templeogue.  The Minister should recognise this and inform the NTA that it would be far better to leave the MetroLink underground and direct towards south west Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900022#Z00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1537360500,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to address this matter in the House.  As he is aware, the recently published national development plan which was launched earlier this year by the Government as part of Project Ireland 2040 brings together the metro north and metro south projects, as envisaged by the NTA&rsquo;s greater Dublin strategy, in one project called MetroLink.  The MetroLink project involves the development of a north-south urban railway service that will run between Swords and Sandyford, connecting key destinations along the 26 km route.  There will be 25 stations in total, 15 of which will be brand new.  A large proportion of the route will be underground, including where it passes under the important city centre area and Dublin Airport.  The underground section will terminate close to the Charlemont stop on the Luas green line in the south city area to where the MetroLink will connect and run southwards on the existing Luas green line.  The Luas green line will be upgraded to metro standard as part of the project.  It will provide Dublin with a high capacity, high frequency cross-city rail corridor, serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital and existing destinations along the Luas green line to Sandyford.  MetroLink will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations, while offering an interchange with other rail, DART expansion, light rail and bus services.  It is predicted that capacity for 15,000 passengers per direction per hour during the busiest peak times will be required along the corridor.  MetroLink will have capacity for 30 trains per hour in each direction; therefore, it will greatly enhance the public transport offering in Dublin.  The creation of approximately 4,000 jobs during construction is also envisaged, which is very significant for the economy in the region.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA, in conjunction with TII, completed a public consultation process on the emerging preferred route earlier this year.  The emerging preferred route is the proposal which has been identified as the likely optimal scheme from a technical design perspective, without the benefit of public consultation and input.  It is riot a finalised and selected scheme; the final layout will only be determined after consideration and evaluation of the issues raised during the consultation process.  The purpose of the process that also included public consultation meetings was to obtain the views of the general public, particularly those along the identified emerging route, and take that input into account in finalising a selected route.  TIl and the NTA received approximately 8,000 submissions, including one from the residents in College Gate apartments, which they are reviewing, with assessing changes to the scheme in order to address a number of the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA is aiming to complete a report shortly identifying a final preferred scheme which will be the subject of a further public consultation process.  The report is expected to be published later this year, following a full appraisal of all stakeholder submissions.  While I absolutely understand the concerns raised by affected stakeholders,  believe there are many benefits that the MetroLink project can bring.  I am confident that the NTA and TII, through the consultative process they undertook, will find a way of delivering the MetroLink project and maintaining good routes that will interchange with other public transport services, while doing so in a way that will respects the social and community life of the city.  Until the public consultation report is published, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on the details of the proposal at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900022#Z00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537360500,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Like the Minister and, I suspect, every person in this House, I think MetroLink is a good idea.  The city requires such an underground service.  In fact, the sooner we have it the better because there is a difficulty for people travelling from the outskirts of the city into the centre quickly.  We have seen from another transport proposal, BusConnects, that the intention is to try to get people from the outskirts into the city promptly.  However, the BusConnects project does not really take into account the fact that there are also people along the route into the centre of the city, in the urban villages, who have to be served.<\/p><p>The Minister has indicated that it is for the NTA to determine this matter which is still out for public consultation.  However, it is astonishing that so little coverage has been given to the proposal by a statutory body to demolish a group of 70 homes.  I commend Olivia Kelly of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>for covering it today.  At a time when there is a severe housing crisis in the city, it is simply not acceptable for proposals such as this to be made, particularly when they are not necessary.  There are many other routes and locations available for the construction of the underground station at Tara Street.  <\/p><p>It is also obviously a political decision.  Previously we saw the benefit of a lot of campaigning in the case of Na Fianna GAA Club in the constituency of the Minister for Finance.

It has an important historical significance for the town with events such as the capture of General Se&aacute;n Mac Eoin in 1921.

We need a solid framework to ensure the managed development of the Columb Barracks site which will encompass a strong social dividend, rehabilitate its listing buildings and ensure they have a sustainable use.

Following a Government decision last Thursday, both I and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, signed an establishment order under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, establishing the Land Development Agency, LDA, on an interim basis.  The establishment order is very much an initial and enabling measure to get the agency up and running as quickly as possible while at the same time recognising that the Government must act swiftly in providing a fuller primary legislative basis for the agency and its intended scope of powers and operations.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way on this and I expect to have the general scheme of the Bill to the Government in November.  This will take account of the intended functions of the agency, which will include co-ordinating appropriate State lands for regeneration and development, opening up key sites not being optimally used, especially for housing delivery, and driving strategic land assembly working with both public and private sector landowners to smooth out peaks and troughs of land supply, stabilising land values and delivering increased affordability.<\/p>  <p>  The legislative basis for the LDA will also need to take account of its role in addressing the historical and traditional volatility in land prices as a result of land speculation as well as alleviating delays in delivering housing and strategic urban redevelopment generally.  This can often be as a result of hold-ups in delivery due to disparate land ownership and cost allocation for infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the legislation will need to take account of the intended positioning of the LDA as a commercial State-sponsored body with appropriate corporate governance and oversight arrangements and one which, like any other market operator, will act within a clear Government policy framework.  In that context, it is critically important to take account of the decision that the Government has made requiring all public land repurposing to deliver at least 40% of any housing potential on such lands in the form of social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the LDA establishment team, which is advancing its work on key sites as well as engaging with public bodies which control key sites, in developing the detailed approach to the scope of operations of the agency and learning from best practice abroad in similar public land agency type organisations.  This detailed and preliminary input is key to informing the development of the general scheme of the Bill, for which I intend to bring a further memorandum for the Government in early November.  This will seek approval to the detailed drafting of the legislation which we will be working hard to complete so that a Bill can be published and brought before the Houses.<\/p>  <p>  Allowing for those considerations and complexities, at this point the ambition will be to secure the enactment of the legislation by Easter 2019.  That said, the agency has been established on an interim basis.  An allocation of &euro;20 million has been made available by my Department until the legislation is put in place and the capitalisation by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, of &euro;1.25 billion can be made.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Burke for all the work he has done with me and my Department to date, as well as with his local authority, to ensure we meet the concerns of his constituents when it comes to the delivery of more affordable housing from public lands.  By doing so, we can also meet the concerns of his constituents in how we protect ongoing uses of these sites and the ongoing interests of the community.  This will be a significant benefit to Mullingar.  The new agency will see that the public land is put to use for the public good.  The LDA will be the developer to do this.  It will consult local Deputies and the county council, as well as other interested community groups when it comes to the master planning and development of the site.  It will be an early win for the LDA because it is a priority site agreed with the Minister for Defence.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, for his co-operation to date on this.<\/p><p>This is not about slicing and dicing land.  This is about bringing forward public land for housing for the public.  By using this site in this strategic location, we will be able to deliver more housing, both subsidised and social housing, at a more affordable price and also housing for the public.  What is more, it will not just be housing delivery on these key sites.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, has a mandate beyond housing.  We have tied in that important housing mandate but it will be able to meet the other interests of the community, as necessary, when we are talking about a site of such scale and strategic importance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900023#AA00500","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537361700,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed response.

The listed buildings should have a sustainable use that will benefit Mullingar.  Projects could be developed in the interests of the nation and of the people of Mullingar in terms of a museum, the highly significant historical events that are part of the DNA of Mullingar and, indeed, the proud history of the 4th field artillery regiment, which, unfortunately, left Columb Barracks in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  It is a welcome development that we have an agency to drive forward this site and ensure we will have an increase in housing supply in our locality.

There is a framework to develop this site in a sustainable manner and to protect and find a sustainable use for the listed buildings.  With Brexit and all the various uncertainties and Mullingar being quite close to the Border area, no one knows what future this significant site may have.

There must be a social dividend from this site and it is important that dividend will be there for the people of Mullingar to enjoy.<\/p>  <p>  I would just make a few more general points about the LDA.  We are talking about State land, public land, which is not being used efficiently, that is in very desirable locations and that could be much better used for housing, schools or other community uses, including the ones the Deputy outlined.  We now have, for the first time, a requirement that State land must be used more strategically in the public good and must be made available for housing for everyone, not only public houses for the public but also locking in 50% of houses for social and subsidised housing.  That does not mean that we are selling 50% of the State land to private developers.  Neither does it mean that 50% of houses on these sites will be unaffordable.  Anyone who says otherwise is misleading the public.  The State will be the developer.  That is the purpose of the LDA.  It is not to sell off the land to other developers.  We will be the developer and we will use different methods to deliver and guarantee housing for the public in the public interest as well as other public goods, as necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Without this new agency, State land that is in needed locations might never have been used for housing.  When we look around our urban centres and our town centres on the outskirts of some of our villages, we can see how State land is not being used where it should be used for housing.  When we think about our ambitions in Project Ireland 2040, there is a key role for the Land Development Agency here.  If we are going to double the growth of our cities other than Dublin while also growing Dublin in a sustainable way, we need an agency to co-ordinate State land better and bring it forward for housing delivery and other types of delivery.  If we are to smooth out the peaks and troughs that we have seen that have led to numerous housing crises in the history of our State, we also need the State to be bringing forward its significant landbank for housing delivery.<\/p>  <p>  While the agency meets certain needs regarding the current shortage that we have, there is a longer-term ambition and strategic goal for it.  We have needed such an agency for decades.  It is very good we have one now as it looks to the future of particular sites, including the barracks in Mullingar, which the Deputy is right to be so protective of, and that we ensure we lock in protections for those sites and for the public in Mullingar into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900024#BB00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Funding","time":1537361700,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900024#BB00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1537361700,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Carline Learning Centre in Lucan, County Dublin, has been providing a unique educational social care and psychological service to young people for more than 25 years.

I got a reply from the senior Minister recently to a parliamentary question.  It was disappointing that he described this service as out-of-school provision.

The reality is that without this facility, they would be excluded from education.  The centre's outcomes are very successful.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin indicated, having done the junior certificate, more than half of these children return to mainstream education.  The Deputy pointed out clearly that there is an issue regarding the condition of the physical structure of the building and, while we have received a reply, the various funders are washing their hands of it because it is funded in an unusual manner.

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who is attending to other Government duties today.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Carline Learning Centre, Balgaddy, Lucan, County Dublin, was established as a community-based project in 1993 to assist young people who were not availing of mainstream education.  Since then it has developed into a social care centre of learning which offers a combination of educational, emotional and social care programmes.  The centre caters for young people aged 13 to 18 with a current enrolment of 27.<\/p><p>Education is provided in line with the primary school year calendar.  Referrals to the centre are made by Tusla&rsquo;s educational welfare service, Garda juvenile liaison officers and Tusla social work teams and care homes.  Currently, 63 part-time hours per week are provided by the Department of Education and Skills at an annual estimated cost of &euro;150,000.  The Department also provides an annual non-pay grant of &euro;170,000 to Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, to meet the day-to-day running costs of the centre.  In addition, the centre receives annual funding from Tusla.  In 2017, Tusla provided &euro;91,190 comprising an annual allocation of &euro;60,000 plus additional funding of some &euro;30,000 for that year.<\/p> <p> In addition to the funding provided to the Carline learning centre, the Department of Education and Skills funds a range of national programmes catering for early school leavers, such as Youthreach, community training centres and youth encounter projects, which are represented in Dublin.  The Department&rsquo;s DEIS plan 2017 sets out the vision for education to more fully become a proven pathway to better opportunities for those in communities at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion.  Action 88 of the plan provides for a review of current out-of-school provision to inform future policy in this area.  This review is being carried out by a working group chaired by the Department of Education and Skills and includes representatives from Tusla and the education and training board sector.<\/p> <p> With regard to capital funding for the Carline facility, the Department of Education and Skills has no record of an application for capital works from the centre and, consequently, it is not aware of the issues to which the Deputies refer.  The Minister has asked that I inform Deputies that the Department is willing to consider an application for funding to address fire safety and health and safety issues at the centre.  The Department has already been in touch with the DDLETB and it has agreed to contact the centre to assist its board in this matter.

I encourage people to engage in these public consultations to have their views known, not just on the negative elements of the proposal but also on its positive aspects.<\/p><p>People have asked me time and again what the NTA does.  The National Transport Authority is the body responsible for public transport.  It is responsible to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and he and the Government are responsible to the D&aacute;il.  The reason we have moved this motion is to ensure the Minister is aware of the anxiety, worry and concern caused by BusConnects.<\/p><p>There are some positive elements of BusConnects, such as the segregated cycle lanes, which I welcome.  Earlier today, the Minister referred to BusConnects and segregated cycle lanes, but in reply to a question he was unable to say exactly how much will be spent on this measure.  Perhaps the Minister will do so this evening.  The new orbital routes will alleviate the need for everybody to come into the city centre.  This will reduce congestion and is welcome.  The new fare structure is also welcome.  I would, however, question why the Minister enabled the NTA to allow Bus &Eacute;ireann to withdraw the refund facility before this new fare structure and cashless option was introduced.  Greater capacity and new energy efficient buses are all very welcome.  I put it to the Minister that the drafts of the plan that were put on display at the end of July have caused great anxiety.  Public meetings organised by my colleagues, Deputies Jack Chambers, Lahart and O'Brien, Councillor Cormac Devlin and Senator Catherine Ardagh, were attended by between 100 and 600 people.<\/p><p> The NTA is responsible to the Minister.  I want him to give a commitment on the floor of the D&aacute;il that the consultation process is not simply a box-ticking exercise, that the views of Dublin Bus service users will be taken on board and that, whenever a redesigned network is agreed to in draft format, that it will be put back out for consultation in order that the 150 million passengers who use the service annually will have an opportunity to give their verdict on it.<\/p> <p> Was Jarrett Walker and Associates the only consultancy firm considered for the draft plan?

It shows the importance Fianna F&aacute;il places on this issue that it is our first Private Members' motion post the summer recess.  It is a major issue that may affect Dubliners.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Robert Troy has covered some of the positive aspects of BusConnects, in which we welcome the investment of &euro;1.2 billion which is undoubtedly needed in the creaking public transport system.  I commend the Deputy on another point.  The process would have been done and dusted had it been left to the Minister and the NTA.  It was at the Deputy's insistence at the transport committee in July that the public consultation process was extended.  It is important that people have their say.  The meetings I have hosted in Dublin Fingal have been attended by hundreds of people because it is their bus service and they care about it.  The review is good and that we will find out what people want is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  I will cite a few examples from my constituency of Dublin Fingal which per the census has a population of just under 300,000 people, as the Acting Chairman will know.  It is a young constituency with many commuters.  Let us consider some of the changes proposed.  The 33 bus route serves the major growth areas of Balbriggan, Rush, Lusk and Skerries.  All direct services into the city will be discontinued.  Direct services from Donabate and Portrane into the city will be discontinued.  Direct services from Malahide, where I live, will be reduced by 25%, but from some areas of Malahide such as Seabury there will be no direct services into town.  There will be no direct services into town from Kinsealy.  The direct services from Portmarnock will also be removed.  During the Topical Issues debate the Minister mentioned the much vaunted metro north proposal and the need to serve Dublin Airport with a light rail or metro system.  We need to serve it with bus services.  In north County Dublin the 102 bus route will be removed.<\/p>  <p>  People are concerned.  This is a quality of life issue.  It is about how people get to work, college, hospital appointments and school.  Just before I came to the Chamber I received an email from Portmarnock community school, which has 900 pupils.  Pupils in secondary schools are concerned about how they will get to school based on the plans.  We want to ensure public consultation means just that, namely, that it means consult, listen and changes to BusConnects where it needs to be changed.  Let us consider the Dublin Port tunnel, one of the best pieces of infrastructure built in the past 20 years.  All of the 142 bus route services which pass through it - nine buses per day - will be discontinued.  Is there a reason for this?  Are the routes being cleared to allow for the future privatisation of services?  That is not stated in the report and we never received a copy of the exact terms of reference.<\/p>  <p>  I am speaking on behalf of my constituents in Dublin Fingal when I say that if the BusConnects report as it stands was to be implemented in the morning, it would be an unmitigated disaster for services on many routes.  While there are positives, changes need to be made, where appropriate.  The motion is important, as it directs the Government to give a firm commitment that it will listen to customers and ensure those who are dependent on buses will not have routes ripped out from under them.  As for the over-reliance on the Northern-DART commuter line, anyone who uses it will realise it is already creaking at the seams.  We cannot just put tens of thousands of additional passengers onto a rail line and say the issue has been resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome and wholeheartedly support my party's motion.

Many bus users who currently use direct routes into the city centre from where they live will need to take at least two buses to reach their destination.<\/p>  <p>  There will be problems with the proposed interchanges, particularly given the difficulties they will cause for the elderly, wheelchair users and people with special needs.  There will be capacity issues at the bus interchanges.  I can imagine the chaos there will be on the Malahide Road at the Artane roundabout when people arrive to catch a second bus.  I assume the Minister can give assurances that the bus stops at the interchanges will be close together.  Has any thought been put into that matter?  Will there be pedestrian-operated traffic signals to enable people to cross the Malahide Road?  These issues have not received sufficient consideration.  Will the number of buses be increased?  The solution to the problem of bus services in the city is to increase their number.<\/p>  <p>  It is a general rule in politics that, if people have had the benefit of a service for generations, we cannot just take it from them overnight, yet that is what is being proposed.  In Edenmore there are problems with the 27A bus route.  In Howth there are problems with the 31 bus route.  In Raheny there are problems with the 29A, 31, 31A, 31B and 32 bus routes.

Both last week and this week DART services from Malahide and Howth were significantly overcrowded.  By the time they get to Harmonstown and Killester, they are completely full, which is quite dangerous.  Passengers who wish to get off at various stops have to bash their way through the crowds on the carriages.

It all sounds very well and I listened to and observed how that might work.  I will give an example of one area.  A bus leaving Rathcoole, the 69, goes no farther than the Luas stop at Saggart.  When one reads the narrative, it says that instead of being once an hour, the 69 will be twice an hour, which looks like a net gain.  When one gets to the Luas line, the Luas is very frequent, so that is not a problem.  The problem in reality is the return journey.  One ends up in the middle of nowhere, with no shelter, waiting for up to half an hour to get a bus.  These are the concerns with losing the direct route which have not been factored in, including where one is waiting and the type of environment one is in.  People are genuinely concerned about the loss of that direct route.  I do not have time to go into every route and I will not.  Some of the design takes buses out of existing population areas.  The one that goes through Clondalkin village, the 13, will no longer come down the Fonthill Road and serve the whole parish of Sruleen and will no longer go up Woodford Road and serve the parish of Knockmitten.  Two areas are being left vacant.<\/p> <p> Much of it relates to interconnectivity between Dublin Bus and other modes of transport and where the plan does not clearly indicate the additional capacity that will be made available on the Luas.  People are concerned that at 7.30 a.m., at the Red Cow, the Luas is full.  What will happen if more people are brought to that?  That is a huge source of concern.  The underlying concern is that the plan is predicated on increased frequency, with a bus every eight or ten minutes.  For that plan to happen, the quality spines, the corridors, have to be in place.  There is a lack of clarity about implementation.  At what stage are the corridors built and at what stage does one revert to this new BusConnects project?  People are genuinely concerned that the transition will take place first, so new bus routes will come in before the spines and corridors are in place.  If that happens, the frequency that the Minister anticipates will not be delivered.<\/p> <p> This is a plan for the future and the timelines are somewhat unclear.  I know the Minister will take an opportunity to spell that out.  People ask me what is happening this year and next year.  I reiterate that people who will go to work tomorrow who are dependent on the 25 in Lucan will not be able to get on that bus tomorrow because it will be full.  While we are planning for the future, we are not dealing with today's demand on some of our routes.  People are not able to get on the bus.  There are other routes with similar issues, such as the 68 from Newcastle.  Some people living in Lucan get on the outward bound bus to go farther out so that they can cross the road and get a city-bound bus.  I ask the Minister, in his response to this, to set out how he sees this being implemented with regard to the delivery of the capacity that underpins the required frequency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900026#DD00600","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537363500,"counter":281,"content":"<p>As other speakers have said, there is massive anger, dismay, concern and fear about this BusConnects proposal.  Across my constituency, we have held four meetings and have another one tomorrow, Thursday.  Hundreds of people fear that this will drive a wedge through their communities, their connectivity and undermine the present and existing bus service.  The Minister is trying to create radial routes to channel people into central, spinal arteries which will bring them to town.  That is all very good on paper but people who might have disabilities and elderly people may have to switch or go backwards to go forwards into town.<\/p>  <p>  Whoever designed this in the company the National Transport Authority, NTA, tendered it to, Jarrett Walker + Associates, is trying to impose an American-like transport system on a city that cannot take it.  Many people across the suburbs of this city cannot operate within that service.  There was a proposal in recent years to build a spinal artery but to have it as a parallel bus service to the existing one so if people want proper connectivity through their communities, that will be enhanced and improved.  This plan robs Peter to pay Paul.  It takes buses from existing communities, estates and neighbourhoods and brings them into a channel, but undermines their present service.  The fear emanates from there.<\/p>  <p>  In my area, the 39 bus, the main service for people for many years, is being removed and abolished altogether.  People are being asked to go backwards towards a new hub in the Blanchardstown Centre.  Anyone who knows the Blanchardstown Centre knows there is complete gridlock at the best of times.  This proposal to try to create a hub in the Blanchardstown Centre will only increase commuter times and undermine people's commute and the promotion to them of public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The 37 and 38 are losing connectivity.  People will have to get off on the north side of the city to switch.  It is all very good on paper, but people who do not want to switch or to have their existing commute increased but want their services and frequency increased are being undermined.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is removing the 40D and 17A from a growing community, Tyrrelstown and Hollystown, which will have an isolating effect on the communities.  That is an area of population growth in a west Dublin suburb, where thousands of new homes are being built, and in parts of it the Minister has not even planned for proposed growth.  Are the national planning framework and future growth across the city considered?<\/p>  <p>  There is another mistake.  In Clonee, the 70 and 270 are being removed to two local radial routes, increasing commuting times and affecting the connectivity that we have with Dunboyne and many people who go to primary and secondary school there.<\/p>  <p>  What engagement with communities was undertaken before this plan was designed?  I have noticed in all the public meetings I have had that people have constructive suggestions about things that they would like to see tweaked and operational improvements that could be driven by Dublin Bus and the NTA.  This is a plan that has come from the top down and is being imposed on people.  It was a very cynical announcement through the public consultation process.  The Minister announced it at a time when he knew people would not fully engage.  They were not fooled and tens of thousands of people have had their say in this plan.  The removal of the 122 on the Navan Road will mean that communities there will be completely neglected.  The net result for many suburbs throughout Dublin will be an inferior bus service.  It is time that the Minister and the NTA went back to the drawing board.  They are trying to create a sardine service by bringing radial routes into a centralised spine, where the spinal networks can be sold off to private companies.  It is important that we have a public bus system which delivers for the people who pay their taxes, so that we have enhanced community connectivity.  This bus plan does not do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900027#EE00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1537363500,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;notes that:&mdash; public bus and rail services provide an essential environmentally friendly service and their use should be promoted;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Dublin Bus provides a vital and necessary public service for all citizens in Dublin and its greater area, and should receive investment to ensure that its services are maintained, improved and enhanced to meet the needs of a vibrant capital city; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; as with any proposed change to public services, the necessary consultation has caused some anxiety and worry to some members of the public in the last eight weeks since the BusConnects consultations have commenced; andagrees that:&mdash; the current proposals put forward by the National Transport Authority via BusConnects for changing bus routes across Dublin and its greater area be reviewed in the context of all submissions received during this consultation process so that all communities in Dublin and surrounding counties see the enhanced benefits of the new BusConnects scheme; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the reconfigured plan, when completed, should be fully communicated to all local communities and further consultation undertaken if required.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the issues raised, particularly in light of this Government's serious commitments outlined in Project Ireland 2040 which launched earlier this year.  That includes the national planning framework and the ten-year national development plan.  While I agree with the opening aspects of that motion, my agreement stops there.  I am proposing an amendment to the motion and call on the House to support it.<\/p><p>I am a little puzzled by the Fianna F&aacute;il position here and maybe its Members could explain it to us.  I understand that they welcomed this project with open arms.  I fully understand but will not accept the amendment from Sinn F&eacute;in, where there is a consistency which is predictable.  I do not agree with it but they have had a consistent line on public transport.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment condemns privatisation.  I suspect, possibly with mischief aforethought, that they are suggesting that this is in some way a road to privatisation, where we are not going, but at least it shows consistency and we know where we stand.  The situation with Fianna F&aacute;il is deeply confusing.  BusConnects is a project which was welcomed by Deputy Troy, Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on transport, as a project which was vital to keep Dublin moving.  That was his initial reaction to it.  He said on 12 June, &quot;The BusConnects project represents the opportunity to get this investment underway.&quot;<\/p><p>He was encouraging and I welcome that encouragement.  I am disappointed that today we have a motion before the House that is hostile to the direction in which BusConnects is going.  Nevertheless, I think the overall Fianna F&aacute;il position is that the party welcomes the initiative even though it wants to see the consultations go ahead, which we all do.<\/p> <p> When Deputy Chambers says he feels the whole system is wrong I think he is in direct conflict with other members of his party.  On 2 July, Deputy John Lahart, who is the Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesman on Dublin and issues of this sort, welcomed the BusConnects launch and along with his colleague in the Seanad, he could not wait to get into a photograph holding the BusConnects brochure high, so enthusiastic was his welcome for this particular project.  He wanted to be identified with it.  He said it was a great project.

Those concerns which are considered legitimate will be remedied.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to take steps to address the underinvestment in integrated public transport following the crisis where public investment was constrained to safeguard the provision of essential public services.  Project 2040 rightly recognises that significant investment in public transport will be required to accommodate change and growth, while also providing more choice for the travelling public and improving the quality of people's lives.  Together with the National Transport Authority's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035, Project Ireland 2040, through the national development plan, NDP, provides for the planning and delivery of public transport infrastructure and services over the short, medium and long term.<\/p>  <p>  Recent reports show that approximately 70% of people travelling into Dublin city each morning do so by sustainable transport.  Each day the majority, that is 57% of all public transport trips, equating to 136 million passenger journeys annually, use the bus for their commute.  Given the numbers, it is no surprise that the bus has to be the main component of the solution to address the current congestion problem and to meet future transport needs.  One of the flagship investments to be delivered within Project Ireland 2040 and the ten-year NDP horizon is BusConnects for Ireland's cities, commencing roll-out in Dublin.  BusConnects is a key investment priority for public transport to address congestion in Dublin in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  A radical improvement in the bus system can deliver a positive change in public transport performance across all areas of the Dublin region within a relatively short time.  The objective of BusConnects is to deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.  BusConnects will include continuous bus lanes as far as is practicable along the busiest bus corridors, along with a network of park and ride facilities at key locations.  It will also involve 11 orbital routes that will operate on a 15-minute frequency or better, in the north, south and west of the network area.  Enhanced and expanded services will deliver 27% more capacity.  As far as customers are concerned, this can only be a good thing, and likewise for transport workers.  There will also be major improvements to deliver next generation ticketing and passenger information systems, a simpler route identification system and fare structure and a fleet transition to lower emissions.  All that means the number of people living within 400 m of a bus service that operates every ten minutes or still more frequently will increase by 35%, from 480,000 to 650,000.  There will be an increase of 10% in fleet serving the greater Dublin area with significant increases in weekend and post-peak services.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects is not just about buses, as this plan will provide much needed cycling facilities and make it easier and more attractive to cycle around the city region.  Given the increasing number of cyclists across Dublin there is an imperative to provide safe and segregated cycling facilities where possible.  The NTA has calculated that more than 200 km of cycle tracks or lanes will be built or current lanes improved upon.  A better cycling network is good for all transport users.  It avoids cyclists sharing bus lanes with buses and will remove many of the conflicts between buses, cars and cyclists.  The House will be aware that the NTA published its proposals for the core bus corridors project report setting out the outline of 16 radial routes, together with 200 km of cycling lanes, into and out of the city.  The NTA expects to publish the detailed and considered proposals for each of the 16 corridors in October.  At that stage, a full public consultation process will commence.  That will allow people to provide feedback and their thoughts on the proposals and the NTA will fully engage with people along the corridors and surrounding areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900028#FF02700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1537364100,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies &Oacute; Broin, &Oacute; Snodaigh, Brady, Mitchell and Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900028#FF02800","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1537364100,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, Senators and councillors in Dublin have been doing great work in their localities, engaging with people on the ground and with the consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that we are talking about public transport.  The State funds Dublin Bus and now a private British company to provide public service transport to people in the greater Dublin area.  The NTA has a duty to ensure that it fulfils its obligation to the public when new routes are being planned.  We accept there is a need to improve services but it needs to be done in an inclusive and community focused way.<\/p><p>Common sense is also needed.  People having to get three buses for the sake of saving a few minutes on paper is not a solution.  It is unacceptable for any community to be left behind by BusConnects.  It must be about providing an excellent bus service for all who need it, including the elderly, people with disabilities and commuters.<\/p> <p> At this late stage, we are not calling for the consultation to be scrapped.  There is just over a week left of the consultation.  Thousands of people have taken the time to engage with the process.  However, our amendment calls for further scrutiny after that process has concluded.  We want the revised proposals to go before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for scrutiny.  The committee can and should facilitate hearings with representatives of communities where people have objections to the proposals and then take a decision on what parts of the plan, if any, to retain and what parts to change.  A further consultation may be required at that stage, depending on the response of the NTA to the objections raised.  If the NTA is not willing to listen, the BusConnects project will have to go back to the drawing board.

For many, it is very difficult to understand.  I say that as a daily bus user.  There are positives and negatives in the plan and it raises many questions.  In much of the public engagement on the issue, the questions are to the fore.  I share the concerns of my colleagues regarding the limited nature of the public consultation to date, which is why many of us have felt obliged to organise our own public engagements to ensure that people have the information they need.  I have organised nine meetings in my constituency at which I have presented people with the facts.  I met representatives of the NTA who explained the plans to me.  I am telling people how it will affect their area and letting them give me feedback on the proposals.  I am encouraging them to engage with the consultation, to highlight their concerns and to propose possible solutions within the overall plan to the NTA and take it at its word that it will listen to such proposals.  We will judge the NTA in that regard when the process is complete.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the feedback I have received, there is a big concern about the interchanges - will they operate right, will there be sufficient frequency at the change points, will there be sufficient shelter etc.  There is concern about a loss of direct routes to hospitals.

There is concern and a lack of confidence in the promised level of investment.  We are not mischievously raising the issue of privatisation.  At every public meeting I have attended, people have raised it as a concern.  The best way to put that concern to bed would be for the Government to make clear that privatisation is not on the agenda.<\/p>  <p>  I share the concerns of my constituency colleagues regarding, for example, the rerouting of the No. 13 bus and the lack of increased frequency of the No. 25.  I mentioned Stewarts Care in Palmerstown.  Later this week, I will attend meetings in Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart, communities which have very real concerns about the proposals as they are on the periphery of the city.<\/p>  <p>  We are engaging in this process in good faith and urge the NTA to listen to bus users as well as bus drivers and their representatives.  That it should go for a second round of consultation following scrutiny by the Oireachtas committee is an eminently sensible idea which I am sure even the Minister, Deputy Ross, can support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900029#GG00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1537364700,"counter":316,"content":"<p>The project is named BusConnects but many people who have looked at the plans that have been presented thus far consider that BusDisconnects would be more apt.  For example, under BusConnects no buses will go through the heart of Drimnagh.  It is very easy for a person to sit in the United States and draw lines on a map and say that everybody will be within 450 yards of a public bus or transport service but that will not be the case in Drimnagh or Chapelizod. Five bus routes currently serve Chapelizod, which causes its own problems, but that service will be reduced to one bus every 30 minutes.  Elderly persons who use the shops in Ballyfermot, the closest shopping area to Chapelizod, will have to walk up the hill to do so as there will be no bus service between those areas.  The points which have been raised in regard to senior citizens' complexes, for example, are being ignored because there is a presumption by the consultant who drew up the plan that everybody is equal.  Those with a disability, senior citizens and those who have no alternative but to walk everywhere as they do not have a car or easy access to public transport are being ignored by the proposals.  It is obvious that such people believe there is something wrong with the proposals or that there is an ulterior motive behind them.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the public meetings I have organised and attended on the issue have been information meetings, rather than intended to whip up a frenzy.  I met the NTA and encouraged it to hold more information meetings.  One such meeting is currently taking place in Ballyfermot at my encouragement.  It is a pity there were not more such meetings which would have better informed the public.<\/p>  <p>  The BusConnects plan seems to be at odds with much of the planning process in the city.  For many years, there has been a policy of discouraging car use in the city and car parking in its environs and suburbs, which means that people have to rely on public transport.  If the public transport is no longer available, people will be disconnected.

I know the Minister is familiar with some of the issues which BusConnects presents for the public transport users of County Wicklow because I saw a tweet he sent in 2017 when he used the No. 44 bus.  I am unsure whether he has used it again since then.  The proposals will impact severely on some of the most vulnerable people in north Wicklow.  The Minister has met some people in the Enniskerry area on the issue because the 185 is one of the routes which will be decimated if the proposals come to fruition.  That would affect areas of Enniskerry such as Shop River and Kilgarron, which is made up of a very elderly community who rely heavily on the 185 bus to ascend a very steep hill.  What makes it doubly troublesome is that the local post office is at the top of that steep hill.  Elderly people will not be able to walk up the hill.  The proposal to remove the 185 and replace it with a new route, the 213, which will completely cut out the service to that community is unacceptable.  The changes will make routes more direct and remove services from communities such as the Palermo area of Bray which is currently served by the 185.  The community in that area is up in arms over the proposals.<\/p>  <p>  It seems that it has been left to public representatives to carry out the public consultation, rather than it being done by the NTA or those behind BusConnects.  I take issue with meetings being held outside supermarkets and dressed up as some sort of public consultation meetings.  That is a disgrace.  More than 150 people turned up to a public meeting on the issue which I held in Bray.  Many of them were completely in the dark on the project.  Public representatives are doing the work of BusConnects.<\/p>  <p>  There are major issues in regard to the project.  Many people in Wicklow have made submissions on the proposals.

I agree that the bus network in Dublin and public transport in general badly needs to be upgraded.  Dublin is growing but the current public transport offering does not meet the needs of the city.<\/p><p>However, I have serious concerns about this BusConnects plan.  I attended many of the public consultations in my constituency of Dublin Bay North and spoke to many constituents.  Those people have genuine concerns regarding the changes to their bus route.  Many will now have to take two buses to get to their destination.  For example, residents in Howth who want to go into town will now have to either get off in Raheny to connect with the DART or travel on to Artane where they will change to a different bus.  In parts of the constituency, many schoolchildren will find they have lost their direct bus route to local schools and they, too, will have to take two buses.  That will mean possible delays and longer journey times.  Another example is that one of the new proposed bus routes will no longer serve our local hospital.  There are many issues of concern throughout the entire constituency of Dublin Bay North.<\/p> <p> We need to be mindful of our older citizens and people with disabilities and ensure they are catered for.

Some of the major concerns I have are that it appears from these proposals that bus services are being rerouted and changed and will involve a hop on-hop off service.<\/p>  <p>  Under these proposals, it appears Finglas village will no longer have a direct service.

In my constituency, there are fears over the Xpress bus services from Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Lusk, but I understand those worries are being addressed through the consultation process.  There are concerns about the 43 bus service, which is a major school transport route from Swords along the Malahide Road.  There are also concerns about the 42 route through Malahide.  Those are real concerns and they need to be addressed through the public consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  This is one of the most important public consultation processes that I can remember as the plan before us is a radical shake-up of our traditional bus service and routes.  It needs to be handled carefully, diligently and with a measured approach to ensure any change is an improvement and protects citizens through increased, not decreased, connectivity.<\/p>  <p>  As for the plan itself, there are elements of it I like.  I like the idea of greater connectivity to get to more places with greater frequency.  That is the core requirement of public transport.<\/p>  <p>  The naming of the spine system on alphabetical lines would bring greater clarity of routes, and I believe it would be an improvement on the current system.  I use the bus and I know how to get from my area into Dublin city and I know other bus routes in my own constituency.  Beyond that, I have very little idea which bus goes to Rathfarnham, Blanchardstown, Shankill or elsewhere.  The proposed naming makes sense, and I welcome that.<\/p>  <p>  The identification of transport hubs needs to be very carefully carried out.  The hubs need to be in pedestrianised areas with enough traffic and passive surveillance to ensure people feel safe and secure.  They cannot be in industrial estates or retail parks which will become ghost towns after close of business every day.<\/p>  <p>  We are at an acute point in terms of infrastructural development in Dublin.  The housing crisis is the most visible manifestation of this pressure, but we have it across the board.  We do not have enough water or wastewater treatment capacity to deal with the growth needed to solve the housing crisis, and we do not have the transport infrastructure either.<\/p>  <p>  We have a great company in Dublin Bus, which I liken to Dublin Fire Brigade as one of the few public bodies which enjoys the faith and good favour of the public.  Dublin Bus is creaking under the strain of existing growth and is under pressure from private operators and from people choosing cars above public transport.  They see public bus as being the lower level option, particularly if they live near a train line or at the outer edges of the city.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Bus needs a new plan and it has been involved with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in helping to develop this initial proposal.  If we do not do something radical with our bus service to make journeys quicker and to improve connectivity, Dublin Bus will suffer.  We cannot continue to expand the service in a piecemeal fashion.  There needs to be radical change.  We want to be in a position were young Dubliners in particular keep their Leap card for longer than they currently do before feeling a need to get a car.  This requires integration of transport modes and investment.  I also believe strongly that it requires the State to retain control of these critical transport modes.  The State needs to lead on this issue and to stand strong.  It is also a big part of leading on climate change.<\/p>  <p>  What this motion boils down to is an attack on the process of public consultation itself.  This is the first phase of public consultation.  At the very outset, it was extended until the end of September.  Extra information meetings were arranged in communities throughout the city and county.  This is a proposal for consultation, not a plan for implementation, so people should engage with the process.  It will come back for further public consultation and if the plan that comes back is egregious and awful, then we will all ensure it is not implemented.  I guarantee, however, that if we asked the people of Dublin four months ago if the bus service needed to be improved or changed in their area, the vast majority would have said \"Yes\".<\/p>  <p>  We now have a draft plan.  I believe it will be changed a great deal as this phase of public consultation concludes, but I worry that the die has been cast and the plan will be scrapped.  This morning, on Leaders' Questions, we heard Members who have never delivered anything to anyone calling for BusConnects to be scrapped.<\/p>  <p>  This motion has been tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il, which will be involved in the negotiations for the next programme for Government that are due to begin either in a couple of weeks or after the next election.  Either way, I imagine the party will call for this plan to be scrapped.  It has used this process as an opportunity to get posters on poles and leaflets in doors and to tap into people's fear of change.<\/p>  <p>  The consultation itself must be genuine and responsive.  While I believe that will be the case, there are problems.  The Lower Kimmage Road, Santry village, Terenure and Dublin 15 are areas which need focus through this process.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned the issues in my own constituency which need to be addressed.  I believe there is scope for another A spine from Balbriggan to travel straight onto the M1 and into the city.  Balbriggan is the second largest town by population in Fingal and has further zoned land which will see its population increase to the west by thousands.  With a direct spine service, those people could reach Whitehall on a bus in the time it would take to get to Balbriggan train station.<\/p>  <p>  Large population centres such as Malahide and Swords need to be considered carefully in terms of the spine routes.  Swords is under-resourced in the current plan and much work needs to be done to ensure there is coverage for such a large town.<\/p><p>It is incumbent on us all as politicians to give public consultations a chance to ensure they are strong and robust.  I believe \"save our bus service\" messages are reckless.  They foment the belief that public consultations are foregone conclusions and not something with which people should engage positively.  Let us see what comes out the other end of this process before coming to judgment and execution.  This is also a lesson we can apply to other public consultations, from local area plans to wastewater treatment plants as well as to BusConnects itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900030#HH00600","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537365900,"counter":326,"content":"<p>As somebody who uses Dublin Bus a lot and has done for all my life, I must say there are welcome areas of the proposals, such as the new orbital route, the fare and the 90 minute period.

I want to address the positives first.  There are some positives with BusConnects, particularly around the orbital routes, cycling infrastructure, dedicated bus lanes, transferable tickets and so forth.  Dublin Bus was once referred to as the workhorse of public transport and it certainly is that.  It is probably one of the few bus services, if not the only one, in the world where people say \"thank you\" to the driver when they are getting on and off.  I hope it stays that way with BusConnects.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects is quite confusing and convoluted.  A person would need a degree to work out what is what and where to go.

I want to talk about that 8%, especially in Dublin Mid-West.  Areas such as Newcastle and Rathcoole, which have growing populations, new housing and so forth, will lose their direct bus service into the city centre.  This was mooted in 2010 under Network Direct by Dublin Bus, but the people of Newcastle and Rathcoole, through people power, won their direct bus into the city centre.  It does not make sense for commuters in Rathcoole or Newcastle to lose a direct bus service into the city centre.

I have a list of the 2,700 submissions we have so far collected from people who are furious, worried, anxious and angry at plans to remove local bus services in a way that will particularly hit the elderly, the less mobile and working-class areas.  Route No. 4, which serves Stradbrook and Blackrock, is gone altogether, leaving that area with a replacement bus service that will not go into the city centre and will be half as frequent.  Bus services direct into the city from Ballybrack, Loughlinstown and Sallynoggin are gone altogether.  People will have to go to D&uacute;n Laoghaire and change to another bus there, which still will not go into O'Connell Street but will stop at Merrion.  The No. 63 will be replaced by a less frequent service in the Monkstown Farm area, which has already lost the 46A service, which used to go every ten minutes.  Dalkey will lose 50% of its bus service because the 111 and the 59 will be replaced by another service that will be half as frequent.

In the case of my own area, which is obviously a pattern from what others have been saying, we will be losing direct buses such as the 70 from Dunboyne and Littlepace.  Corduff and Mulhuddart will lose the 38A route into the city centre and we will also lose the 40D from Tyrrelstown.

What has not been said is how many extra buses will be there to cater for all the extra people who are now joining their friends from other communities to fight for the extra spaces at the interchange.  People in greater Blanchardstown should not be begging to keep their three direct buses into the city.  We should have a light rail system and a Luas from Broombridge.  We are a community of 110,000 people with some of the biggest multinational companies bringing about 25,000 people into the area every day, none of whom seem to think there is any onus on them to provide any extra public transport to cater for those workers.<\/p> <p> I do not make any apologies for organising meetings.  It is amazing that one of the Labour speakers spent time whinging and whining about people organising meetings.  The reality is that people made what they thought crystal clear to us.  They are not stupid.  They know they are losing buses and are not going to put up with it.  We will not wait for a few months.  We are directing people to engage in the consultation to make their views very clear but we need a strong community campaign to send a clear message to the NTA that this will not be acceptable.<\/p> <p> I agree that this is about privatisation - be it of the spine or orbital routes or cutting Dublin Bus off from even having local routes - but either way, it has increased isolation for many communities.  People do not want to get off a bus once they are on one.  Nobody wants to do that, particularly if they have impaired mobility or are older.  Why would anyone want to do so in weather such as ours?  We know that there are people, in Fianna F&aacute;il in particular, organising meetings to put their faces on posters but they are the architects of privatisation.  This is definitely linked with the Minister's plan for privatisation.  Only this week, 10% of buses were taken off Dublin Bus and given to Go-Ahead Ireland.  Workers' salaries and conditions are far worse.  It is a Fine Gael agenda.  None of the lessons from Great Britain has been learned.  A very similar policy was pursued there under the Thatcher government that opened up the bus market to competition and privatised the national bus company.  It has resulted in unprofitable services being run down.  We must subsidise public transport.  It cannot just make a profit: otherwise communities will be left bereft.  Many people have been left without transport in London as a result and fares have skyrocketed so the idea that this is not linked with privatisation is very hard to believe since the Minister is such an admirer of the Ryanair model.<\/p> <p> This is about political pressure because the Minister does have the legal power to direct the NTA in legislation to stop a proposal.

If it was serious about this plan, why did it not move on the core routes first and build them out - it will only start that consultation next month - rather than causing the extreme anxiety it has caused across Dublin Bay North?<\/p>  <p>  My constituents in Howth, Sutton, Bayside and Raheny are desolate and very upset at the proposed changes to the 31, 31A, 31B and 32.  Those who live in Howth and Sutton will now have take the N6, which will run between Howth and DCU, and will have to connect to the city centre via Raheny DART station or the Artane roundabout on the D or A spine.  There seems to be an emphasis on the fact that we also have a DART station but early morning and evening DART services are already at capacity and anyone who commutes every morning in particular will speak of the cramped conditions.  BusConnects is also ignoring the huge numbers of weekly visitors to Howth from all across the north side and many thousands of foreign visitors.  It has been estimated that 1 million visitors travel to the peninsula every year.  Obviously, we need both a bus and a fixed rail transport system to deal with that.<\/p>  <p>  There is also uproar all across Ayrfield, Edenmore, north and south Coolock and Artane at the changes to the 27, 27A and 27B.  The 27A will no longer have a direct route to the city centre for residents of Blunden Drive through to Edenmore and on to Artane.  Many residents living in areas for 40 or 50 years are desolate that they might have to walk a mile on a cold and wet morning to one of these spines to catch the bus to town.  There was uproar among commuters in Artane, Beaumont, Ayrfield and Edenmore at a meeting I attended organised by my colleague, Councillor Paddy Bourke, in the Artane Beaumont Family Resource Centre where many older speakers asked whether BusConnects was a plot to get older people with bus passes off the buses because they could not see any other sense in it.<\/p>  <p>  We received a lot of documentation and have huge files on this.  The other thing that has been ignored in all the documents we received is a disability impact assessment.  There is no mention of universal design.  These are fatal flaws.  Ms Graham, Mr. Creegan and the rest of the NTA should go back to the drawing board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900032#KK00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1537366500,"counter":339,"content":"<p>In spite of current criticisms of Dublin Bus, for example, people getting on in the outer suburbs and there being not enough room on the buses by the time they come to the inner suburbs, I think Dublin Bus has been providing a very good service.  Its staff have been very courteous and helpful.  Obviously, there is a need for some changes.  I would highlight the cross-city routes that have been introduced, which have been of great benefit.  The one I know best is the 151, which covers the north side, docklands and St. James's Hospital, the Coombe and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.<\/p><p>We know Dublin is growing and that this growth means that changes are needed.  I understand the need to tackle the duplication of routes and the need for more orbital routes so some change was needed.  However, it is the way in which change and proposals for change are handled that is the issue.  Commuters do not want to lose what they have become used to, particularly something that has served them well over the years, so any mention of change must be handled in a very sensitive way.  It must be handled carefully with the commuter in mind.<\/p><p>Many of venues for this consultation have been hotels and shopping centres.  There could have been a better use of community centres and places within communities that would be more accessible to the people.  From talking to people who went into some of the hotels, at times there were more staff there than there were members of the public coming in to find out.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection said earlier that the end game may be different but the consternation, dismay and protests could have been prevented if all of this had been handled properly because, no doubt, it is being seen as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  Surely the first exercise should have been with the commuters and staff about what is and is not working and how to improve things so that the proposal becomes a collaborative effort.  One will not get 100% agreement but people can work through consensus building.<\/p><p>These proposals are presenting real difficulties.  For example, those people who get on one bus and stay on it for a 45 or 50 minute journey must now get on a bus, get off it, get on a bus and get off it.  How is that supposed to be age-friendly, not to mention people with a disability?  The blurb from BusConnects talks about employers, employees, visitors, tourists and cyclists.  This is all very well; they need transport but what about those who are older or who have disabilities?  They do not need multiple journeys.<\/p><p>There are positives that people have acknowledged such as low-emission vehicles, a 5 minute service along the spinal route and a 7.5 minute service along the orbital route.  Like so many other Deputies, the two buses in my area will be replaced with one and it does not appear as if the service will be much better.  We saw the debacle with MetroLink.  I thought the NTA would have learned from that to do a bit more thinking outside the box beforehand and to do the thinking away from the office and away from just paper plans by getting out and talking to people.  One good thing is that the Government's amendment recognises the need for more to be done on this.  We need real consultation, not just presenting it the way it has been presented, namely, as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.<\/p><p><b>Deputy Joan Collins:<\/b>This is one of the most radical plans ever put to the people of this city.  While it has been said that there is ongoing consultation, one must really drill down into these proposals because when one looks at the map, the first thing one will see is that the east side of the city is fairly well served but as one goes west into the working-class communities, the buses are being taken out of those estates.<\/p><p>Those bus routes grew from the needs of the people living in those estates, including older people and people with disabilities, in seeking access to shopping centres and so on.  That is why I have called for this proposal to be scrapped.  As the word \"disability\" is not mentioned once in the 58-page document on BusConnects, it was not disability proofed.  Jarrett Walker has admitted that he is not qualified to talk about these bus routes and that he fell into the consultancy game, which is an important point.  What should have happened is that bus drivers and many more passengers should have been consulted.  Those involved should have gone into communities to talk to people about what they needed.  The bus drivers know exactly what is going on and the way routes work.<\/p> <p> More resources are needed for orbital routes.  Those resources should be provided straightaway to provide more bus services on orbital routes.  This option could be tested for a year and we could then come back to the drawing board.<\/p> <p> The National Transport Authority has been set up, but it is a law unto itself.  Like the HSE, it is not accountable.  It has a huge amount of money to be put into bus services and done some good work in the provision of real-time information.  However, the fact is it is operating by stating, \"We are putting this to you and you either accept it or you do not.  We will listen to you, but we do not know how much we are going to take from it.\"  Jarrett Walker has said that if 15% of the plan was changed, it would have to be scrapped.  I think of all of the areas in which I am involved and all jof the meetings I have attended, from Bluebell to Inchicore.   Services on the 68, 69 and 13 bus routes are to be diverted down the Crumlin Road, which means that the 68 and 69 bus routes will be removed for local people who will be able to use the 63 bus service every hour.  Most older people are able to get around, but if they have an issue with a knee, a hip, their heart, a lung or their vision or a disability, that is when they will have problems.<\/p> <p> The plan should be scrapped and there should be proper and real consultation with communities.  The plan could be used as a basis for discussing what we might do, given that there are some ideas in it.  It has to be done in that way.  This is a big issue and people in communities will rise up and come out onto the streets.  I encourage them to come out to have the plan scrapped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900032#KK00300","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537367100,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I note that the motion condemns those involved for the unnecessary anxiety and anger experienced by the public in the past eight weeks since the BusConnects, or bus disconnects, as it has been appropriately described, consultation process commenced.  The motion also proposes reversing the culling of bus routes across the Dublin greater area.  It is interesting that it is happening in Dublin where there is normally no room for buses on the streets.  With the new Luas line, people were not able to cross O'Connell Bridge because it had been measured wrong.  As a rural Deputy, I can understand the anxiety caused.  People living in rural Ireland have been living with it on a daily basis.  I am not one bit anti-Dublin; I am for fair play for ordinary consumers, taxpayers and people who want a decent transport service.  We hear so much about emissions and pollution and are told to change our ways.  Where are we going?<\/p><p>This is typical of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, c&aacute; bhfuil an t-Aire?  Where is the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross?  Every time any of the Rural Independent Group Deputies comes into the House, he flies like snow off a ditch - he is that scared.  This is another appalling mess he is presiding over.  This is the man who was able to write in the Sunday newspapers <i>ad infinitum<\/i>about what he could do.  He could do everything he was nearly infallible, but when he became Minister, he was able to do sweet damn all, only cause confusion and destruction.  He has allowed people like these run riot in TII and the National Transport Authority and God knows who else - the quango queens, the quangos about which he wrote and railed against for decades.  Now, he is promoting them, patting them on the back, siding with them and letting them run riot, which is what they are doing.<\/p><p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport found &euro;2.3 million for consultants, while for the rural bus service proposal there is a mere &euro;450,000.  This issue arose during the debate on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill when he threw &euro;450,000 at us as a sop.  The money would be welcome even if it was only &euro;45,000, but it would not fund the administration system for a rural bus service.  However, he had &euro;2.3 million to give to outside consultants.  As I said, I received confirmation that the Department had paid &euro;2.3 million to private consultancy firms in 2017.  This has generated considerable anger and frustration, particularly in the light of the fact that the Department is proposing to spend five times less than that figure to fund a rural bus service for 50 communities in 2018.  Who is codding who?  How can the Minister continue to maintain that his plan to tackle the issue of rural isolation has even a shred of credibility when we now know that the entire budget of &euro;450,000 for the rural bus link scheme pales into insignificance when compared to the millions he was paying private consultancy firms?  It is all spin and about consultancy firms.  I hope the consultation process will be meaningful, but I fear all of the consultation is meaningless because, as in the case of An Post where there is an independent review, it is being dictated to by the terms of reference.  Consultants are being paid to give us the answers we want or that the Government wants and to hell with the people and their views, including the people of Dublin.  I support the Members who are railing against this.<\/p><p>What will be even more galling for people living in rural communities is the confirmation that more half of the &euro;2.3 million was given to AECOM, a US firm that describes itself - wait for it - as a global network of experts who aim to deliver transformative outcomes.  I knew that the Minister's vocabulary was good, but he should receive a medal for this.  How could it have happened under his watch?  He wrote about this issue day in and day out.  He railed about it from the back benches when I was a member of the Technical Group with him.  He also spoke about it for a lifetime in the Seanad, but he has retired and moved into the palatial palace that is his ministerial office across the road.  He was going to transform the place, but he goes into hiding when anyone stands up to challenge him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900033#LL00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1537367100,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Where is he?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900033#LL00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1537367100,"counter":343,"content":"<p>He answered the wrong question this morning when he read the wrong answer.

It blocked the traffic because it was too long.  These fellows designed it and, I suppose, they never measured the bridge.  They did not care.  Giving this amount money to consultants, against which the Minister railed for decades, is anathema to ordinary taxpayers.  It is outrageous.  The Minister's Department paid AECOM &euro;1.3 million in 2017 for - wait for it - an evaluation of sustainable transport areas.  It might do in the Bronx or Washington, but it is not fit for Dublin.  That is for what we are paying the money of hard-pressed taxpayers.  As we have no figures for what the Minister is giving to these whizz kids in 2018, we do not know what they are getting.  We have no idea what he will pay them in 2018 as that detail has not been provided.  This is unbelievable stuff and he then runs out of the Chamber when he expects someone to come into it to challenge him.<\/p><p>On the face of it, there is one clear winner in all of this and it is not rural Ireland.  It is not Dublin either, the capital city.  However, even if we leave aside the private consultancy fees paid, it has also been confirmed to me that the Department paid a separate sum of &euro;544,000 in 2017 in &quot;incidental expenses&quot;.  I wonder if it was for camera footage after taking pictures of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae at the all-Ireland final.  The Minister did not know where Croke Park was two years ago; I had to show him where it was.  I also had to show him where Jones Road was.  That is the kind of man we have, but Government Members are happy to sit with him and make excuses for him when he disappears.  That is with what we are dealing.  As I said, the figure is &euro;544,000 in incidental expenses.  He would have written such an article on the back page of the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>and if he was still in opposition, it would not fit on the back page.  It is spend, spend, spend and get me here, get me there, get me anywhere.  They - the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, and the others - were going to go to meet Kim Jong-un, but the Minister did not go and stay there.  Again, it is &euro;100,000 more than the entire budget for the rural bus link scheme.<\/p><p>The figure for incidental expenses in the Department was &euro;544,000, whereas the peasants can go back to their caves as far as the Minister is concerned, with a sum of &euro;450,000 provided for services in the country as a whole.  That is the insulting way he talks to all of us.  It demonstrates that when it comes to addressing the issue of rural isolation, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is reluctant to spend what is needed.  However, when it comes to paying fees, private consultancy costs and expenses, money will always be found.  It is available for tickets for the World Cup and everything else.  I knew that he had played hockey, but I did not realise he was so into some other sports.  We saw the unfavourable way he treated rural communities when he got his own through the sports capital grants scheme, with which he said he had nothing to do.  He said he would not be involved and was above all of that stuff.  I do not know what he is at, but I hope he will go back to engaging in meaningful consultation.<\/p> <p> Consultation on the ground on the basis of the terms of reference the Minister has brought up should not be accepted.  It will result in a desired answer, while the consultants will get more money.  It will be a matter of \"Let them eat cake.\"  The people are sick and tired of this and, as a public representative, I am tired of dealing with it.  The system does not care about the people.  Members are public servants; representatives who have been elected to look after the people and not waste money.  It would be a lot easier to meet the Pope than to arrange a meeting with TII representatives.  They will not meet anyone and someone cannot discuss a speed limit of which they have made a hames, for example.  They are untouchable.  We got rid of the NRA.  As I have said several times, we had the IRA and decommissioned it only to be left with the NRA.  We now have the TII, but it is only a different name.  The way it treats people and the House is an insult to our intelligence.  It is a merry-go-round of money, spin and consultants.  It is a waste of money.  I am not anti-American, but I wonder why we could not get consultants from Ireland.  If we were to get an ordinary group together from a secondary school, it could come up with a concept to improve transport services in Dublin, rather than firing out millions to a US company to give us a diatribe at the end of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900033#LL00800","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537367700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I represent the constituency of Dublin North-West which has the distinction of being the only constituency in the Dublin area which is entirely dependent on bus services.  We have no other transport options.  I am a very big fan of Dublin Bus which provides, in the main, excellent services in the constituency.  There is very good frequency and we have service choices on the main routes.  Many bus routes also extend right into housing estates and serve a predominantly older profile of constituent very well.  Our big problem in recent times has been a lack of capacity, with more people at work and a larger population in the area.  As such, there is a need for better capacity.  While we have good orbital services, there is a need for more of them also.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the problems associated with Dublin Bus are the result of underinvestment by the Government.  We all travel abroad and marvel at the public transport systems in other European capitals, but the reality is that, in the main, those services are highly subsidised.  There is a recognition in these countries that if one wants capital cities to work, one has to subsidise public transport and ensure one gets commuter car traffic out of cities.  Unfortunately, the Government does not recognise the need to do this and Dublin Bus remains well starved of funding relative to services in other European capitals.<\/p>  <p>  On the surface, the BusConnects proposals appear positive.  They refer to greater frequency, greater clarity, priority for bus services and safer cycling infrastructure in conjunction with the proposed new bus infrastructure.  The difficulty is that the proposed infrastructure changes are separate from the network changes.  The consultations on both elements have been separated completely, with the result that there has been no consultation as yet on infrastructure and the discussion has been focused on network changes.  The problem with the network changes is that it has been extraordinarily difficult for people to find out what is being proposed.  The quality of the maps and the consultation has been extremely poor.  Most of us spent the summer trying to figure out exactly what BusConnects proposed.<\/p>  <p>  When one looks at the detail and how it affects my constituency, one notes that several local services which currently extebd into housing estates are proposed to be removed entirely.  That will result in a lot of people having to walk much further to access bus services.  I asked about this at the launch of BusConnects, but I did not receive a satisfactory answer.  There was very little, if any, consideration given to the needs of older people and people with disabilities.  There is and was no emphasis on their needs whatsoever in the report or at the launch.  That is borne out by the fact that so many of the local services which currently extend into housing estates are proposed to be removed completely.<\/p>  <p>  It will be said that while one may lose out in some regards, there are benefits in other ways.  One then looks at those other ways and the spines.  The theory on the spines sounds fine.  We have very good bus services running along all of the main thoroughfares in Dublin North-West.  The implication of BusConnects for the eastern side of the constituency, however, is the withdrawal of what is currently a great service which takes people to Dorset Street, Parnell Street, O'Connell Street and the main shopping area for people on the northside and a number of entertainment locations.  This main road service which takes people right to the centre of town is being withdrawn entirely.  That will have huge implications.  There are winners and losers, but when one looks at the detail, there are more losers than winners.  For that reason, we need to go back to the drawing board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900034#MM00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1537367700,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The Green Party is broadly in favour of BusConnects.  However, while I do not agree with the motion to throw the baby out with the bath water, I have a few specific observations from my constituency of Dublin Rathdown.  Churchtown, Nutgrove and Ballinteer have been massively underserved by public transport services in recent years.  With the elimination of the 48A, 14A and 16A bus routes, the 14 bus route is the only one which serves Churchtown, Nutgrove and the north end of Ballinteer in the direction of town, with the 17 and 75 bus routes running east-west.  There is a presumption that everyone in this area can use the Luas, but that is not the case, given the distances involved, in particular for the elderly and those with impaired mobility.  With the revised BusConnect routes, the area will still only be served by the east-west S6-S7 route and a new 14 bus route which cuts out Churchtown and Ballinteer south of the Barton Road East roundabout at Nutgrove, as far as the roundabout at the junction of Broadford Road and Stone Masons Way.  The residents of Hillview, Llewellyn, Marley Court, Meadow Mount, Meadowbrook, Beaumont Avenue, Holylands, Landscape, Whitehall and Whitebarn have again been forgotten.  At the very least, services on the 14 bus route must be more frequent and further and alternative options should be considered, in particular between the roundabout at Broadford Road and the roundabout at Barton Road East.<\/p>  <p>  Residents in Sandyford village have concerns about the proposed new routes, as does the community in Kilternan which is currently served by the 44 bus route which allows access to town through Dundrum.  The 44 bus service will be replaced by the 213 bus service from Kilternan to UCD.  Given the importance of Dundrum as a hub for people throughout the area, it is surely the case that the people of Kilternan should continue to have a service to Dundrum.  To that end, I recommend extending the 12 bus route all the way to Kilternan.  It makes no sense for the proposed A3 route to extend to Balally Luas stop and then turn down Dundrum main street.  No one lives along this stretch and the buses will further clog up the narrow street.  Retaining the old 14 bus route from Wyckham roundabout along the Ballinteer Road would continue an important service for the people of Lynwood, Ludford, Ailesbury Lawn, Wyckham Park Road and the areas around the Willows.<\/p>  <p>  The last issue I raise is a vital one for many in the area.  There is still no direct service for people living in any residential part of Dublin Rathdown to St. Vincent's University Hospital.

I wish to start by acknowledging the very good service Dublin Bus provides to the people of Dublin.  That is not said frequently enough.  Dublin Bus has a very loyal customer base.  It provides an efficient and reliable service.  The one issue with Dublin Bus at present that anyone travelling around the city in the evening or morning can see is that there are huge numbers of people at bus stops waiting for buses.  If anything, the service is so popular that more buses are required.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that there are very many good aspects to the BusConnects proposal.  We are not about trying to throw out the whole proposal, but it is important that we as public representatives can debate in this House and communicate to the Minister the concerns that very many communities around Dublin have about the proposals.<\/p>  <p>  On a broad level, my concern is that the proposal seems to have as its primary objective the transport of people from the outskirts of Dublin into the centre of Dublin as quickly as possible.  This may be a commendable purpose but it ignores the fact that there are whole swathes of communities on the way into the centre that use Dublin Bus and live in those areas.  It is very important that we ensure that the people who are served well by the Dublin Bus system on those routes into town continue to be well served.  Part of people's strong concern that I have seen at meetings relates to the fact that certain areas will no longer be serviced by buses.  For instance, there was great concern that the No. 1 bus would no longer go into Sandymount village and would avoid it, thereby damaging businesses in the area and upsetting individuals, including older people, who used it to get there.  I am pleased to say that the NTA has indicated that this will be reversed and that the No. 1 will go through the village.  The No. 47, however, will no longer be able to service St. Vincent's University Hospital for people coming from Ringsend and Sandymount, and the No. 15A will be removed from Terenure Road West, which will be a great inconvenience to the people in that area.  I hope the individuals behind the BusConnects project will listen carefully to the submissions being made as people have legitimate concerns about it.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the separate but related issue of the bus corridors.  One area of my constituency has been told it will be grievously affected by the bus corridors, and that is the Lower Kimmage Road.  The Lower Kimmage Road is a busy residential, two-lane road with bicycle lanes.  The individuals on the Lower Kimmage Road have learned from the proposal that has been put out there that it is proposed to convert the road into a three or four-lane high-speed bus corridor.  The people who live on the Lower Kimmage Road have done exemplary work in being able to identify from the documents what is being proposed, but no one has gone there and given them full information about it.  They are aware, however, and there are general indications that they will lose parts of their gardens, even as far as up to the front doors of their houses.  That is no way for any statutory body to treat people who live on such a road.  People have invested huge sums of money in their homes and lived there for many years.  They are entitled to be treated with respect.  It is not acceptable for it just to be left within a statutory document that people will lose their gardens or have a three or four-lane high-speed bus corridor through them.  That is not a suitable way to treat people.<\/p>  <p>  It is wrong to state that these issues are being led by politicians.  They are not.  They are being led by the local community.  There was a meeting on Sunday at 7 p.m. - one could not have picked a worse time to have a meeting - about the impact the bus corridors would have on the Lower Kimmage Road.  I would say there were more than 200 people at the meeting.  The intensity of feeling there was very significant.  Many people were very fearful about what is being proposed.  We need to respect the fact that people are entitled to be informed about this.  This is a major infrastructural project.  There is a total lack of awareness that the Poddle river flows underneath the road and that people on the road use bicycles and want to continue to be able to do so.  There is a concern throughout the Dublin community that the people putting forward these proposals are not aware of the reality of what is happening on the ground.  If those putting forward this proposal had gone out to the Lower Kimmage Road, which is a narrow, winding road at the end, they would realise it is simply madness to put forward a proposal that there be a three or four-lane high-speed bus corridor there, particularly when we have Harold's Cross Road, which has a quality bus corridor.<\/p>  <p>  I could go on but I am conscious that my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, wants to have his say as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900035#NN00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1537368300,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I wish to start by thanking my colleague, Deputy Troy, for tabling this motion on the BusConnects proposal.  I wish to speak to the Minister of State about how the proposal affects my constituency of Kildare North, especially the areas of Celbridge, Leixlip and Maynooth.  Before getting into discussion of the proposal, I acknowledge the positive engagement I have had with both the NTA and Dublin Bus, which have been very helpful in explaining the document, saying what the proposed changes are and listening to the feedback I am giving them based on the reaction of the people in those three towns.  I should say the population of the three towns combined is in the region of 65,000.  They are very heavy users of the public transport system that is there but it needs to be expanded and improved upon.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to identify positives in the additional bus services and routes proposed in the BusConnects proposal.  I have been campaigning for some of these routes for some time as both a councillor and now as a national politician, and it is nice to see them included.  One is the proposed W8 route, which would connect Celbridge, Maynooth and Tallaght.  This would have a massively positive impact because it would connect two colleges, one being a university, a hospital, the Luas and a number of train stations along the route.  There is also the proposed 259 service, which would connect Celbridge and Leixlip, two towns with a combined population of 40,000 that have never had a public transport service connecting them directly before.  What is important is that when this process in respect of the positive additional routes suggested in BusConnects is completed, the Department, the Minister and the NTA would act immediately to implement those routes, connecting up locations with services that they have never had.  This would be a positive outcome.  It should be remembered that Dublin at present is really a no-go zone to bring a car into.  What we are trying to do is encourage people to use public transport, but they are not able to use buses or trains if the capacity or the service is not there.  Right now all those modes of transport are at capacity.<\/p>  <p>  One of the negatives I wish to touch on briefly is the proposed removal of the direct services to Dublin from Celbridge, which has a population of nearly 22,500, from Leixlip, which has a population of 15,000, and from Maynooth, which has a population of 15,000 and a further university population of 12,000.  Those are the kinds of figures we are dealing with.  I will pick just two examples as I am conscious of my time.  The current 67X services Celbridge to Dublin, and there are nine express services from Celbridge to Dublin at peak times from 7 a.m.  It is now proposed to reduce this to three services.  If one looks at the statistics of each of those buses in the morning, one will see they are all at capacity.  Four of the nine buses most mornings are three-axle buses, so, to get technical about it, they have 30% more capacity, which can bring 125 people, and they are all full.  They are driving by bus stops leaving people behind them.  The other buses carry approximately 90 passengers and are also all full at that time.<\/p><p>What we need is to maintain the services we have and to support them by increasing capacity because the figures, which Dublin Bus can give the Minister any day of the week he wants, show that these buses are at full capacity, can take no more and are leaving people behind them.  We need additional services and additional capacity to help people commute from Celbridge, Maynooth and Leixlip for work, college or whatever.  That is not currently the case.  We need to address that now.  A way of dealing with that would be to put on extra buses.<\/p> <p> If we were to look at Leixlip as an example, River Forest is an estate of nearly 725 houses in the Captain's Hill area.  There is one direct service hourly from that location to Dublin.  It is now being proposed to remove that completely and to replace with it one direct service a day and to bring in orbital services, which will obviously not work in that particular area.  The engagement and feedback I am getting from Dublin Bus, and from the NTA in particular, is that they are going to take this on board.  I hope when that when they redraft this proposal, they will include the positives and will listen to us as public representatives and, more importantly, listen to the public transport users.  I hope they will maintain the existing services and put on additional services to complement them.  That is what we need.  We cannot afford to lose any of the direct services we have coming in from satellite towns on the periphery of Dublin, such as Celbridge, Leixlip and Maynooth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900035#NN00400","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537368900,"counter":361,"content":"<p>This draft plan needs severe reworking and I am confident it will get it.  I represent the Dublin North-West quadrant of the city.  As my colleague, Deputy Shortall, said earlier, it is somewhat unique in that it is singularly served by the bus.  It is the only form of public transport we have.  We do not have a Luas or DART in that quadrant of the city.  We depend on the bus.  There are many elderly people and disabled people in my constituency.  They depend on the bus.  I use Dublin Bus every single day to get in here.  I am aware of the positives of Dublin Bus and I am glad to see Deputy O'Callaghan highlighting them, but I am also aware that it can be improved.  It can be improved.  Orbital routes are a potential improvement.  Improvements in frequency are a potential improvement.  Every day we see potential improvements being rolled out across the Dublin Bus fleet, such as the introduction of WiFi, Leap cards, etc.<\/p>  <p>  The BusConnects proposals, however, are causing great and grave concern for people.  Accordingly, I would advise such people to get involved, to play their role and part in the public consultation, and to make sure that their voices are heard in it.  The public consultation only lasts one more week, until 28 September.  It is vitally important not only that we have the debate ourselves as public representatives but that the people get to have their say, get their voices heard, and let the NTA, Jarrett Walker and the powers that be know that this plan could do with improvement, that the edges could be knocked off it, and that a better plan can be put forward in the future.  That is why public consultations exist and I am confident that, when the public has its say, this plan will be changed and amended accordingly.  I would love to speak more but my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has a great deal more to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900036#OO00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1537368900,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank all contributors to this debate.  I have listened carefully to what has been said.  The first fact to mention is that this is a consultation process document and not an implementation plan.  It is also a matter of fact that Dublin city and its environs are growing, the economy is growing, employment is growing, and we need to plan the bus network to cater for that growth and, indeed, for all existing and prospective passengers.<\/p>  <p>  Some 70% of people travelling into Dublin city each morning do so by sustainable transport.  Some 57% of all public transport trips, or 136 million passenger journeys annually, are made by bus.  As those numbers grow and as congestion worsens, it is obvious that we need a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region.  The current bus network is complex which makes it hard to use easily.  We acknowledge that there are few orbital routes, which makes it hard to move around the outer parts of the city.  There are also many overlapping routes.  There is a need to better integrate our networks of bus, tram and DART transport.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin aims to build a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus routes to make bus journeys for passengers faster, predictable and reliable.  It is redesigning the network of bus routes to provide passengers with a more efficient network which connects more places and carries more people.  Dublin Bus is developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system and implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up passenger boarding times.  It is revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure for passengers.  Dublin Bus is allowing seamless movement for passengers between different public transport services without financial penalty.  It is rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information, and it is increasing the provision of bus shelters.  Starting now, it is also transitioning to a new bus fleet using low-emission vehicle technologies.<\/p>  <p>  There will be many benefits.  The revised bus network will see overall service levels increase by over a quarter - 27% - up to 200 million customers.  This increased service level includes services on 11 new orbital routes that will operate on a 15 minute frequency or better in the north, south and west of the network area. The number of people living within 400 m of a bus service that operates every ten minutes or better will increase by 35% from 480,000 to 650,000.  There will be an increase of 10% in the fleet serving greater Dublin area.  Significant increases in weekend and post-peak frequencies will also be evident, and more than 200 km of cycle tracks and lanes will be either built or improved upon.  This will allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice with frequent services and better access.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that I acknowledge that, as with any proposed change to public services, the necessary consultation on these proposals has caused some anxiety and worry to some members of the public.  I am very aware of the anxiety in my own D&uacute;n Laoghaire constituency.  I want to mention two specific examples which I know have been raised as part of the consultation process in my own constituency.  The first is the proposed removal of the 84 and 84A bus routes which service the Luas stations at Cherrywood and Brides Glen.  This removal will mean that older people and people with impaired mobility will have no direct access to the Luas.  This is because of the grade difference between the N11 and the Wyattville Link Road.  One solution has been put forward but BusConnects welcomes other proposals from residents.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue with BusConnects in my constituency is the proposal to discontinue the No. 4 bus service, which will greatly inconvenience residents in parts of Blackrock, Monkstown and Sallynoggin.  Many people who have contacted me on this are very anxious and upset.  We understand the anxiety.  Under the proposed changes, two buses will be required to make previously simple journeys to places such as Blackrock Clinic, St. Vincent's Hospital, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, UCD and Trinity College difficult.  This will affect a number of students attending school.  The location of the nearest DART and Luas services are not within walking distance for many passengers of the No. 4.<\/p><p>This is a vital transport infrastructure for people living in the area.  I also have grave concerns for those living in the upper half of Sallynoggin Road where it joins Rochestown Avenue that they will lose their service entirely.  As an elected representative for D&uacute;n Laoghaire, I want to ensure constituents who have concerns make proposals.  I urge them take part in the public consultation process and to engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Dublin Bus.  These submissions will be examined carefully.<\/p> <p> The current proposal should be reviewed in the context of all submissions received during the consultation process.  Further consultation, including with Oireachtas committees, will be undertaken, if required, on the reconfigured plan.  This is a consultation process and not an implementation plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900036#OO00300","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537369500,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Lahart who is sharing time with Deputy Troy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900037#PP00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1537369500,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Earlier in the summer, the NTA and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, announced the most radical transformation in the history of the State for public transport in Dublin.  However, the Minister is not here now.  That says it all.  Need I say any more?<\/p>  <p>  On this side of the House, we recognise there are eight aspects to BusConnects.  We wholeheartedly support seven of them.  Colleagues have gone through them, from the simplification of fares and ticketing to improvement to bus stop facilities, etc.  Our issue is with the area network redesign.  What the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, just said essentially supports our motion.  Every Member who contributed, regardless of political hue, mentioned nearly every bus route in Dublin.  Our motion speaks to the reversal of the decisions proposed.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Minister of State and Deputy Rock said that this is not an implementation proposal.  However, the NTA's consultant said that if 10% of the proposals were removed, then the BusConnects project would be a waste of time.  Accordingly, it is an implementation proposal.  It is also part of Project Ireland 2040 but there has been no great Government acclamation for this, aside from the Minister, Deputy Ross.  I have not heard the communications unit go into overdrive about BusConnects.  As one of my colleagues described, instead of connecting people, the evidence coming from public meetings is that people are fearful that it will disconnect them.<\/p>  <p>  This side of the House acknowledges the gridlock facing Dublin city.  In my constituency, upwards of 1,200 people have attended the public information meetings I have held.  What we have heard at these meetings is that the public will buy into a system of public transport when they are offered segregated bus corridors which would essentially operate like a Luas tramline, get them from A to B and, regardless of whether it is early morning peak or the middle of the afternoon, the time of travel would be the same.  They will buy into a system where there is an obstacle-free journey.  Accordingly, we buy into the spines proposal where buses arrive on time and there are sufficient numbers of buses.  If the infrastructure was created first, then people would buy into it and leave their cars behind because they would know there is a reliable system of bus travel spines going into and across the city.<\/p>  <p>  We support the orbital routes proposal.  However, this is really putting the cart before the horse.  The NTA is proposing to implement BusConnects without any of the infrastructure being in place.  Initially, it said it would be implemented from the third quarter of 2019 but it has now pushed it out to 2020.  One cannot implement any of this.  Not one driver will be persuaded to leave his or her car behind under this proposal.  If they saw proper segregated bus corridors and cycle lanes which allow untrammelled journey from A to B, then people will buy into it.<\/p>  <p>  Several bus drivers came to my public information meetings and spoke about the existing position.  The existing bus corridors are not policed which causes bus drivers significant delays.  We asked them about the No. 15 route in Knocklyon on which buses are full by the fourth stop.  People asked why all buses have to start at the terminus.  Why can one bus not start at five stops in on the route?  The drivers said the NTA will not allow this as it micromanages the whole process.  The No. 54A allows connectivity with Tallaght Hospital, county council and social welfare offices for people in Templeogue and Greenhills.  The No. 123 allows connectivity from Templeogue and Greenhills to St. James's Hospital.  Those routes are going while other routes will be overloaded.<\/p>  <p>  Two questions the public asked more often than anything else were who is the NTA and is BusConnects a done deal.  In all my public consultations, I gave the public all of the NTA's official material.  I did not give them an unvarnished or varnished approach to it.  The Minister of State claimed it is not a done deal.  I told people at my meetings that the NTA is answerable to the Minister and the Minister is answerable to us.  However, the Minister is not here.  The public may take what it wishes out of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900037#PP00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1537369500,"counter":366,"content":"<p>It is disappointing that the Minister did not feel the need to wait for the full debate.

What is the timeline of how this proposal advances from here?  We are no wiser than when we came in.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was critical of Fianna F&aacute;il for representing the views of Dublin Bus passengers.  I do not know where he has been all summer.  Does he realise the concerns people have about these proposals?  I was supportive of this project at its launch and I still am.  However, I said in my press statement that the NTA most engage with local communities which will be impacted by changes to the bus network and must communicate effectively with people from start to finish.  This is what this motion is about.  This is about ensuring the consultation process is not a box-ticking exercise but that the people's views are heard.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister was in opposition, he was heavily critical of the NTA.  In an article in December 2011 he referred to the NTA as a quango established to protect CI&Eacute; and its political masters and stated the Government had the power under legislation to issue guidelines or policies to the NTA.

The draft network when reconfigurated must go out for public consultation.  The Government has the power to ensure that happens.  What we all want is a public bus service that not alone will maintain the current number of people using it but will encourage more people to migrate from their cars to public transport.  We need to see additional capacity.  That needs to be provided now, not sometime in the next three or four years, because many of our routes and buses are busting at the seams.  We also need to see an acceleration in the roll-out of energy efficient hybrid buses.  To date, the Government is still standing over a policy of purchasing diesel buses.

I want to acknowledge again on the record of this House the extraordinary contribution of Vicky Phelan as well as Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh and the other women and families impacted by the CervicalCheck audit.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally is clear that this crisis happened because of a failed attempt to disclose the results of a retrospective audit to women who had developed cervical cancer.  There was significant public disquiet when it became clear that women themselves were not told about reviews of their own past screening history.  The failure to disclose was absolutely wrong and I recognise the severe and real distress it caused to women and their families.<\/p>  <p>  As is often the case with complex issues, some of the complexity was not fully reflected in the public discourse.  I think it is fair to say there were people who believed women had not been told they had cancer - that assertion was made in this House - and people who believed that a diagnosis of cervical cancer in a woman who had been screened as negative was automatically negligence.  Thanks to Dr Scally&rsquo;s report, there is a greater understanding now of the complexities involved.  <\/p>  <p>  He has provided welcome reassurance on the quality of CervicalCheck laboratories.  He has found no evidence of any cover-up - his words - and, most importantly, he has crystallised what this is about.  <\/p>  <p>It is about women and their families who did not get the information they should have got and the devastating impact that it had on them.  It is about unreservedly recognising that people have a right to their own medical information.  It is about ensuring that our systems work and acknowledging that they completely did not work in this case.  It is also about the impact of this disease at a human level and the need to do all we can to prevent it.  Collectively, we should endeavour to effectively eradicate cervical cancer.  <\/p>  <p>  The report is the culmination of intensive work by Dr. Scally and his team done quickly and under intense scrutiny, for which I thank him sincerely.  It is robust and comprehensive and it will help ensure that women can trust that our cervical screening programme is safe, effective and patient-centred.<\/p>  <p>  I particularly want to extend my gratitude to the women and families who engaged with Dr. Scally.  I do not underestimate how difficult this must have been.  I thank them for their courage and commitment in ensuring that our cervical screening programme is improved.  I was struck by a comment that was said to me many times by many of the women who had been impacted, namely, that the one thing they wanted to come out of this was a better screening programme, that lessons would be learned and that they were doing it for their daughters, granddaughters and sisters to make sure we have a screening programme that is robust and saves lives.  Their generosity in how they engaged is something for which we should all be extremely grateful.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally's reports sets out the enormous impact this situation has had on those affected.  Through my own interactions with them, I have gained some sense of the distress and pain that has been caused.  He has made a number of key recommendations in regard to disclosure, which I intend to implement in full.<\/p>  <p>  I intend as a priority to establish a new independent patient safety council that will, as its first take, carry out a detailed review of the existing policy on open disclosure.  The resulting policy will have legislative underpinning and will operate right across the whole health service.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a statutory duty of candour is a further key requirement.  The patient safety Bill is scheduled to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny on 26 September and I ask Deputies on all sides of the House to prioritise the scrutiny  of this vital legislation because it provides a legislative framework for a number of important patient safety issues, including mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents.<\/p>  <p>  While these are key steps, disclosure is also about core values such as openness and honesty, and trust and confidence in doctors. This report presents a challenge to the medical profession but I believe the majority of doctors and the profession in general holds these values very dear in the care they provide.  I also believe the dedication and commitment of the entire range of health professions, including doctors, is one of the key assets of our health service.  I want to see constructive engagement on the part of the medical profession with these issues.  There were failings on behalf of their profession and they must be addressed by them.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be clear that the Government is committed to the continuation of the CervicalCheck programme, as well as BreastCheck and BowelScreen.  We know that screening saves lives, and Dr. Scally has emphasised this.  Crucially, he found no reason the existing contracts for the laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced.  He is satisfied with the quality management processes in the laboratories, contrary to some information put on the record of this House by others in the past, and the report presents no evidence that the rates of discordant smear reporting or the performance of the programme fell below what is expected.  He emphasises the very substantial contribution that CervicalCheck has made to women&rsquo;s health over the ten years of the programme, and I know that has been acknowledged by Deputy Kelly and others in this House.  A woman&rsquo;s lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer has substantially reduced since the inception of the screening programme, from one in 96 in 2007, to a one in 135 in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally also considers that the work which has been carried out by staff in the programme to keep the screening service operating in the middle of what was a very intense controversy is worthy of recognition.  I want to thank the staff for that as well.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not downplay in any way the very serious gaps that have been identified in the governance structures of our screening services, but I want to emphasise that Dr. Scally has stated in unequivocal terms that he had found no evidence of conspiracy, corruption or a cover-up - his words.  This speaks to the integrity of our public and civil servants.  Some of the things that were said in the heat of this controversy questioned the integrity of some of those public servants in leadership positions and, I think, after an independent report makes a finding on that, it is important we acknowledge the actual position on the record of this House, as outlined by the independent expert that we as an Oireachtas put in place to establish the facts.<\/p>  <p>  The report examined the provision of briefing notes on screening audit and disclosure to my Department in 2016.  These came into the public domain in May.  I welcome the clarity provided - the inquiry considers that it would have been unreasonable to expect senior management in the HSE or, even more so, departmental officials to have intervened on foot of these notes.  That is a finding of the inquiry.  Subsequent problems were significantly associated with the failure to disclose, the report says, and it would have been difficult to predict this given the reassurance the briefing notes provided.  As we have limited time, I will not quote from the report but they are there in the relevant sections. <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally has based his findings on careful examination of contemporaneous records.  He has had more than 12,800 records.  I fully accept  his conclusions in this regard and it clear that my officials and my Department acted entirely appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally has been clear that the problems he has uncovered are systematic and relevant to a whole system failure, and I believe a whole system failure requires a whole system response.  I have already taken steps to re-establish a board for the HSE, appointing a chair designate yesterday.  This provides a foundation for proper governance and accountability. <\/p><p>I intend to bring the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, through the Houses of the Oireachtas during this session with a view to establishing the board this year.  A priority issue for the new board will and must be the development and implementation of an effective performance management and accountability system in the HSE.<\/p> <p> We are aware that screening alone is not enough to prevent all cervical cancers, but a well-organised screening programme, when combined with HPV vaccination for boys and girls, can bring us very close to eliminating this disease.  That is the Government&rsquo;s goal and that is the Oireachtas' goal.  I do not intend to play party politics with this issue.  It is supported by politicians from all political parties in this House.  We now need to get on and do it.  We have a vaccination that can save lives.  It can prevent girls getting cancer and can prevent girls dying from cancer.  We all need to support that unequivocally.  I am very pleased that the House supported Deputy Kelly's motion to extend the HPV vaccination to boys.  We need to extend the vaccination to boys once we receive the HIQA health technology assessment in the coming days.  We should look to extend it next year.<\/p> <p> I have given approval to a switch to HPV testing as the primary cervical screening test, and work is under way to progress this change.  This is vital.  We know that of 1,000 women who will be screened, 20 will have pre-cancerous cells.  Screening today will pick up 15 of those 20 women but when we move to HPV testing it will pick up 18 of those 20.  There will still be limitations to screening, but sadly there will always be limitations to screening.  We can, however, have an even more accurate system and, along with a small number of other countries, Ireland can lead the way as we move to HPV testing.<\/p> <p> I want to be very clear that the Government accepts in full all 50 recommendations in this report.  I expect to return to Government in three months with a full implementation plan.  In June I established the CervicalCheck steering committee, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer and the assistant secretary of acute care in my Department.  Crucially, the committee includes representatives of the affected women and their families.  I thank them for their generous and constructive contribution to that work.  The committee meets weekly and we publish its minutes, its agendas and its weekly report on my Department's website.  It will oversee and direct the implementation of all 50 recommendations, and my Department has established a working group to drive the work of those recommendations.  I have written to each of the organisations mentioned in the report about preparations for implementation.  Through the Chief Medical Officer, I have also commenced engagement with the leadership of the medical profession, which is very important.  An initial meeting in this regard took place earlier today, and I intend to meet them shortly, along with the Medical Council.<\/p> <p>The first step I wish to take, which I believe is the most appropriate, is to meet patients and their families, and I look forward to this happening next week.  I will then engage with the Opposition on what needs further inquiry and what is the best modality in which to do that.  I do not believe we should make knee-jerk decisions on this.  I want to try to reach a consensus in this House, but most importantly with the patients also, on how best to move forward.<\/p> <p> Dr. Scally has reached a view on a commission of investigation and we should consider that view and explore it together over the next number of weeks.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is equally with the women and families as well as with ensuring that our cervical screening programme is as good as it can be.  Dr. Scally has given us the framework to fix the very many flaws he has identified.  Our focus must now be on implementation.  If we want to learn the lessons and if we want to fulfil Vicky Phelan's request that some good comes from this awful tragedy, we need to deliver on these recommendations.  I look forward to working with each and every Member to make that a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900038#QQ00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537370700,"counter":376,"content":"<p>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il I welcome the comprehensive report by Dr. Scally.  It is fair to say that it is a more comprehensive report than many of us thought it might be, including those of us who agreed the terms of reference.  Dr. Scally and his team deserve huge credit for very robust and professional work done in a pretty short period.<\/p>  <p>  This came about because of the bravery of some extraordinary people, including Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Stephen Teap.  The types of improvements we hope to see are entirely down to their bravery in standing up and in not being forced and bullied into signing non-disclosure agreements by third parties, so I acknowledge the work they did and the role they played.  I am particularly happy to see that Dr. Scally recorded the testimonies of the women and their families.  This is something there is not enough of and we need to reflect on the fact that testimony is vital.  It is vital in areas such as institutional abuse, it was vital in this area on non-disclosure and we all heard some of the testimony.  It brought to life the types of challenges these women and families have been dealing with.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports all 50 recommendations.  We will work as hard as we can with the Government to see those recommendations implemented as soon as possible.  In doing so, however, we have to see a step change in how things are implemented in all aspects of CervicalCheck.  In spite of the fact that the Government was briefed on this and told that it was going to blow up in public, it was still allowed to blow up in public, which created widespread fear.<\/p>  <p>  The Government promised these women an awful lot of supports, some of which are still not in place.  Huge frustration and struggle has been endured by these woman and their families because the supports were not put in place when they were told they would be.  The women were told by the Taoiseach and by the Minister that they would never have to go back to court.  I raised this in the House with the T&aacute;naiste, and on the morning I raised it, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na was back in court.  Since the promise had been made, this was her fourth time in court.  Even last week we saw it.  I understood that the women and their families were promised they would be briefed before the report was published.  I found that I and other Members of the House were being briefed and a very small number of the 221 affected women were briefed.  The women and the families together should have been briefed by Dr. Scally before anyone in this House or the media and before publication, but this did not happen.  I am not saying this to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to score political points.  I say it because I do not believe the implementation has been there.  I have cited real examples of where I believe the Government has dropped the ball with regard to these women.  We will work with the Government, and we want to work with it, but we have to start delivering on time and according to the promises that were made.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn now to the commission of inquiry.  We would like to see the women and the families listened to.  This whole thing comes back to other people deciding what the women should or should not be told about their own health.  Once given time to reflect on the recommendations in the report, let us listen to the women.  I would like to see face-to-face briefings, for any of the women who want them, with Dr. Scally and his team.  Let us listen to the questions they still have after reading the report.  Let us talk about the different options for getting those answers.  Whatever the women and their families want to do, let us do that, regardless of whether we think it is the right method.  Let us for once do just what they want and put them at the centre of this.<\/p>  <p>  The medical community needs to reflect on some of these issues, as do the Members.  If we can implement these recommendations, not just for CervicalCheck but across the HSE, we would see a lot of improvements in governance, patient safety, patient voices and clinical voices in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900039#RR00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1537370700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>In the two and half years I have been in this House we have spent quite a lot of time discussing female gynaecological issues.

Every woman who had been through the screening progress woke up that day wondering if her tests were okay and if she was okay.  I rang the helpline but it was most unhelpful.  The person to whom I spoke did not offer me any sort of consolation or direction.  By the time I got through, I felt quite frustrated with the process.<\/p>  <p>  It seems that our labs and our screening process are okay and up to good standards.  What is not okay is that while going through the screening process, it is not clear that when one receives a result, it may not be accurate.  We need to work on that.  There was an adversarial approach taken towards women who went through this process.  It is frightening to think that we almost did not know about this issue.  We came very close to never learning about the withholding of information from these women and the difficulties in our processes.<\/p>  <p>  We now need to restore confidence rapidly in the screening programme.  The Minister's response at the outset was lacking.  It was not a rapid or adequate response and it allowed the problem to get worse.  The screening programme saves lives so we need to restore confidence in it.  We need to educate people properly about what a screening programme entails and that if a woman has symptoms in between her smear tests, she must go to her GP.  A woman may have received a result that said she was fine, and she thought she was fine, but may have ignored possible symptoms.

The voices expressed in the Scally report made me furious about how those women had been treated and kept in the dark by a paternalistic and misogynistic health system.  I was furious about how many of them had been spoken to when the bad news was eventually broken to them.  I was furious that the trust they had placed in the health system had been so grievously breached.  A total of 206 women, with families and loved ones, missed out on earlier interventions.

Their evidence and testimony were invaluable to this process, as well as to the final report's conclusions.<\/p>  <p>  The report outlines that the women affected wanted to see a screening programme that would deliver a patient-centred service and put the rights of women at its centre.  Patient-centred care and the upholding of patients' rights are what we expect from health services.  The women came back repeatedly to the issue of how their own medical histories had been withheld from them and that doctors knew information about them but did not tell them.  Why was it withheld?  Dr. Scally is clear, in that there was a degree of misogyny.  I hope doctors will read that point and reflect on their role, as well as on the way in which they speak to women.<\/p>  <p>  I have addressed in the House issues related to women's healthcare.  I have spoken to the Minister many times about mesh implants and sodium valproate.

As the Minister stated, he has given us a framework.  However, the work is not finished, as Dr. Scally acknowledged when we spoke to him.  Many more questions remain.

He criticised the efficacy of quality assurance visits, which were very thin on the ground.  I am struck by the fact that even though the contract between the screening service and the laboratories allowed for a number of mechanisms where difficulties arose, including a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, type investigation on quality matters, that never happened.  I am not raising the issue of quality to cause distress and certainly not to cause panic or to dissuade anyone from availing of the service and having a smear.  I want to place on record that while we have a general reassurance in the report about issues of quality, these beg further investigation in order that we will learn from them.  Ultimately, open disclosure and treating women as autonomous adult individuals entitled to our medical information is an absolute must.  So too is robust quality assurance.<\/p> <p> Many questions arise in this report.  I know the Joint Committee on Health and other committees will address this.

There is universal acceptance that Dr. Scally has done a good job in the timeframe given to him and with the terms of reference that governed his work.  He admits that he was unable to establish the full facts and the truth in many areas because of a lack of time, access to information and so on.  An awful lot more work needs to be done to establish the full facts and the truth.  If that means a commission of investigation, that should happen.  Let there be no doubt about that.<\/p>  <p>  What Dr. Scally uncovered has raised serious questions about the Department of Health, the HSE and CervicalCheck with regard to systems, practices and procedure failures.  We know from the report that one of the company laboratories, CPL, outsourced part of its work to four laboratories that were not accredited or certified to the standards demanded by CervicalCheck.  The problem is that Dr. Scally says in his report that CervicalCheck knew of that, yet did not take the appropriate action.  Dr. Scally asks a number of questions on page 56 of his report.  He asks what volume of CervicalCheck tests was performed in each of these four laboratories, what their compliance with quality and standards was, if CPL informed CervicalCheck of workload being transferred to other sites and whether such transfers were approved.  He asks questions that he cannot answer in his report.  It is incredible that that is the case.  On outsourcing of contracts, there were questions about rolling over of tenders and procurement which I am sure the Committee of Public Accounts will examine.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally was damning about the non-disclosure issue.  That is important because we cannot explain all of this away as simple systems failures.  Some of this happened by design with individuals taking decisions to withhold information from women.  I am not about witch-hunts or looking for people's heads for the sake of it but surely people must be held to account for this.  We have had this far too often and seen it in many areas, not just health but across the public service.  When failures occur, the wagons are circled and they are explained away as simple systems failures when individuals made very bad decisions and need to be held to account.

Loss of trust between clinicians and their patients has been spoken about an awful lot.  I do not want to dwell on it except to say it was enlightening.  It is something on which the medical profession and many different medical representative bodies need to reflect, not just in this area but in a number of other areas too.  Many of these clinicians met during this process.  This was not known to the public until we pulled out the minutes of colposcopists' meetings that took place in the middle of this crisis.  That needs to be investigated.  Clinicians were aware that there was a serious issue but there was no urgency.  We need to find out why that was the case.<\/p>  <p>  There are structural issues with the HSE.  As I stated, this happened because people made or did not make decisions.  It has gone beyond a matter of debate that we will have some form of inquiry or investigation.  Any investigation should be short, must not get in the way of recommendations and should have tight terms of reference.  We need to find out who did what, when, where, why and how with regard to the HSE CervicalCheck and possibly the Minister's Department.<\/p>  <p>  There is a jigsaw for where we are going with regard to cervical cancer.  The priorities are the recommendations, HPV, and herd immunity and extending vaccination to boys.  That is one component.  The second is the review of the slides by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which is critical.  The third relates to Mr. Justice Meenan's work.  I hold the Taoiseach, not the Minister, accountable for this.  On more than one occasion, the Taoiseach did not know what he was talking about.  He did not know what he was talking about on \"Six One News\" when he said that the women affected would not have to go through the courts, the laboratories would be chased and they would settle with the women.  He was wrong and I knew the second he spoke that he was wrong.  He subsequently met Vicky Phelan.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan's work has two components.  The broader component is due in a number of months but his first findings will be in a couple of weeks.  I do not believe the judge can achieve a great deal other than making recommendations, which means the Taoiseach has overpromised a second time.  I find it almost impossible to envisage a scenario in which women will not end up in the courts again and that is disgraceful.  Please bring that message back to the Taoiseach.<\/p><p>The fourth component of the jigsaw is what we need to discuss in the coming weeks as regards investigating who did what, when, where and how in the HSE and other organisations, the issues related to a forum to deal with what clinicians did or did not do and, in particular, the manner in which they behaved.  In addition, there are elements related to how contracts were managed with the laboratories.<br\/><br\/>I am delighted with what Dr. Scally said about the laboratories.  I dare say it helps the Minister and all of us in this country in ensuring we have a screening programme.  We must all behave responsibly in the future in order to have a screening programme.  I welcome that, but we need to ensure there will be an investigation into how the contracts were managed, or not.  I will come back to that point.  <br\/><br\/>Before I speak about the laboratories, I wish to deal with one other matter, namely, the commentary over the summer on the purpose of some of the work being done by many of those affected in this country.  It almost amounted to revisionism.  The view was that their pursuit of justice and their legal rights was, in some way, damaging the future of screening.  That insinuation was wrong and affected people who had ensured the matter became public in the first place.  As far as I am concerned, such revisionism should be avoided.  I know Vicky Phelan, Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh and their number one priority is not self-interest.  They have families or, in the case of Lorraine, she does not because of what happened.  Their number one priority is ensuring screening is available for future generations, my children and everyone else's.<br\/><br\/>I welcome what the Scally report states about the laboratories, but I have some questions.  I am concerned about the manner in which the contracts were managed by the HSE.  The <i>laissez-faire <\/i>manner in which the contracts were managed by the HSE must be investigated.  We know of 221 cases.  There are accepted errors in some cases.  We all know that negligence must be proved, but in some cases we know what happened.  Has CervicalCheck or the HSE investigated what happened in these cases?  It is such a simple question, but it is so obvious that it does not occur to people.  We know of cases, as they are public.  As of today, have they been investigated?  In any scenario where a public body has such issues, surely it looks at its contracts and investigates what happened in each and every case?  Surely, it looks for patterns and examines every detail.  I deliberately raise these questions with the Minister.<br\/><br\/>The new information provided in the Scally report on CPL and outsourcing to other laboratories across the United States is very welcome.  No provision was made for this.  How did the HSE or CervicalCheck not know it?  Who was monitoring the position?  Who was not doing his or her job?  That is not acceptable.  We have had scenarios where the CervicalCheck service was in operation, contracts were in place and we now know outsourcing took place about which CervicalCheck did not know.  We now know that there were errors and issuing about how women were dealt with.  I am still not sure who in the HSE has been investigating that matter, who has gone through the contracts and whose job it was to look at the contracts and ensure there was quality assurance because there was not.  That is a component of an investigation, with who did what, where and when in the HSE, in addition to the other issues I identified.  We will need some inquiry to be agreed to.  It should be agreed to in the next two weeks consequent on the Minister, me and others meeting patient advocates and those who have been the victims, to whom reference has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900041#TT00300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537372500,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Ruth Coppinger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900042#UU00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1537372500,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am not being smart, but I hope it is obvious that I am a woman, that I have access to CervicalCheck services and that I support the screening programme.  I have received a lot of criticism for scaremongering.  I am not scaremongering; rather, I am querying why the outsourcing issue has not been properly addressed.  Privatisation and outsourcing are at the core of the crisis women face in this country.<\/p><p>Yesterday I attended a protest outside the gates of Leinster House with a busload of women from Cork whose organisation was called Women's Lives Matter.  A number of women in the group had been misdiagnosed and had false negatives returned.  They were very upset that they had not been told properly by the clinicians.  They were also very upset at the scandal concerning disclosure, but most of all they were extremely upset that their lives and future ability to have children had been jeopardised by outsourcing.  They demand the repatriation of the service.<\/p><p>The Scally report shows that there was a deep problem with outsourcing, even though Dr. Scally himself said to me that he did not have a problem with the continued outsourcing of the test to the US laboratories.  He said that if he was a woman, he would have faith in Quest Diagnostics.  I refer to his report to indicate why I believe it shows that there was always a problem with outsourcing.  First, the US laboratories were not ISO accredited.  I tabled two parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health in May and he said they were accredited.  It may be the case that they were ISO accredited in May 2018, but they were not ISO accredited when the contracts were awarded and renewed from 2008 onwards.  That is a fact.<\/p><p>There are different standards in the US laboratories than there are in ISO accredited laboratories.  US laboratories perform 100 screens a day, whereas generally the accepted norm and standard in Irish public laboratories is 60 a day.  There is a big difference already, one that could jeopardise the scrutiny of the tests.  Irish laboratories have screeners who are educated to degree level and often go on to undertake postgraduate studies in cervical screening.  They are overseen by clinical pathologists, which is not the case in the US laboratories.  According to Dr. Scally, the cost of the service in the tender from the State to the US laboratories was overemphasised.  The Irish laboratories scored very highly when they tendered, except for costs.  They were not as cheap as the US laboratories.  CPL, the company that settled with Vicky Phelan, was found to have problems on the site in 2011 that were not adequately addressed, yet we still awarded it another contract in 2012.  We may never know why and how that happened because we discovered from Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report that the tender documents had been destroyed in 2017.  Will the Minister, please, explain why that would happen?  I worked in the public sector, in the library service, and we had to keep a record for years and years of every penny that came into or went out of the library, even though libraries do not normally handle money.  Why would the tender documents have been destroyed?<\/p><p>Outsourcing is at the heart of the issue.  I have asked the Minister twice about it.  I asked Mr. Tony O'Brien when he was <i>in situ<\/i>as director of the HSE.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste here one day and the Minister for Finance who had replaced the T&aacute;naiste one day during Leaders' Questions if he could, please, tell us the laboratories from which the 221 false negatives had come.  I was assured I would receive the information.  I asked the clinical professionals if it was difficult to find out.  They replied absolutely not because each slide had its own identity and as soon as a problem was triggered, the first thing that would have to happen was an audit at the point where the slide had originally been tested.  The audit has to happen in the laboratory from where the slide came.  Could we, please, get a simple answer to the question of  from where the 221 false negative slides came?  I believe that is at the heart of the matter.  <\/p><p>The definition of outsourcing and the privatisation of women's health are at the core of this problem.  The reason I raise the issue is the Minister is about to sign off on, if he has not already done so, the continued outsourcing of the service to Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology, a subsidiary of CPL.<\/p><p>Is that not the definition of insanity - doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900042#UU00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537373100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>It is a recommendation of the Scally report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900043#VV00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1537373100,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to address that issue, please, because I am worried about the future of the service as well as its past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900043#VV00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1537373100,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Many people found it highly ironic that at a time when the country was voting in the referendum on the eighth amendment and many Members were campaigning to put women at the centre of their own lives and healthcare, the Government was ensnared in a scandal which involved women's health and views being utterly diminished.

There were two levels of accreditation and many of the labs did not hold the international standard.  CPL, which is owned by Sonic Healthcare, examined 300,000 Irish samples, but one third of those were outsourced to other labs, with the tests being carried out in places such as Honolulu, Las Vegas, Victoria and San Antonio, without the knowledge of CervicalCheck.

This is of current relevance because Sonic Healthcare is the mother company of MedLab Pathology, which is proposing the outsourcing of testing of Irish samples to Australia.  In terms of quality assurance and the visits that were made, it is true that Dr. Scally states that the labs met the standards for the country or region in which they were located but they were not up to international standard.  The local standards varied depending on location.  CPL was asked about its standards in 2011, but Dr. Scally states that there is no record of what happened when errors were identified in regard to the under-reporting of low-level cervical cancers, which is very dangerous because those cancers might develop further.  Consistent error by a pathologist responsible for training others was identified but nothing was done.  No consideration was given to the wider impact of that on the training of other staff.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is the fiddling of figures by Quest in 2014.  Some 1,224 false negatives were identified.  I will have to rush through these figures as I am running out of time.  Quest claimed an error rate of 3.19% but the Scally report identified the rate as 17.6%.  This may be explained by labs in different countries with differing testing and definitions of abnormality being used.<\/p>  <p>  Cost is another major issue.  Why did costs become an increasingly relevant consideration in contracts being awarded?  In 2008, it made up 20% of the criteria but by 2010 it was 35% and by 2012 it was 40%.  The country was in a bailout programme, things had to be cut and cost became far more important.  Does the Minister claim that that would not impact on the testing of women's samples?  In 2016, there were mini-competitions in which cost accounted for 80% of the criteria.  This is doing medicine on the cheap.<\/p>  <p>  Quest Diagnostics has generated profits of &euro;7.7 billion and Sonic Healthcare had net revenue of &euro;3.5 billion.

I have read all 170 pages of the report and it would be helpful if Members had more time to go into its details.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the comprehensive report and the blunt, clear language of Dr. Scally.  He overstepped his brief, however, when he said we do not need a commission of inquiry.  That was not for him to say.  I checked the terms of reference and do not think he was asked to give an opinion on that.  That was one mistake.  He was asked to scope the issues and the questions that arise from this scandal.<\/p>  <p>  I am not a Member of this D&aacute;il to reassure women that they should have cervical smear tests or any other test.  That is not my job.  My job is to ensure that we have an open and accountable system which instills confidence in women and allows them to make up their own minds.  That is what was and is sorely lacking in this matter.  It is the responsibility of this House to ensure that confidence is engendered by having open and accountable systems rather than on the reassurance of Members.  I will leave it to women to decide what they wish to do based on the information available to them in an open and accountable manner.<\/p>  <p>  The report raises serious issues.  As has every speaker, I thank Vicky Phelan, without whom we would not be discussing this today.  I also thank Dr. Scally and his team for meeting women affected by the scandal throughout the country and abroad.  He met 67 women and their supporters in my city, Galway, 130 in Dublin and 60 in Cork.  He examined more than 12,500 documents.  On occasion, he had to apply pressure to access those documents and needed an extension of time.<\/p>  <p>  He has carried out a scoping exercise.  I fully agreed with the scoping exercise when it was proposed by the Taoiseach.  I thought it the best and wisest way to go prior to any investigation to establish the issues.  Dr. Scally has repeatedly pointed out throughout the report that there are other issues regarding the outsourcing of samples from American labs to Honolulu in Hawaii and many other cities and that, apparently, CervicalCheck and the Health Service Executive knew nothing about that.  He wants more time to examine that issue among others.  He also highlights an absence of documentation in one of the laboratories and also in Ireland following the procurement because it has been destroyed.  As such, he can only reach limited conclusions.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the comments by Deputies that outsourcing is a major problem, notwithstanding that the report contains some positive comments in that regard in terms of the standards being good, based on Dr. Scally's observations.  The contract stated that the labs should have the IPL accreditation but they did not.  No one seemed to think that was a problem.  The labs had accreditation under the American system and met those specifications but that is not what was specified in the contract.  They did not have what was specified in the contract.  The contract also seems to have been loose enough for the tests to be sent to Honolulu and for the labs not to inform CervicalCheck, the national screening service, Mr. Tony O'Brien or whoever was in charge.<\/p>  <p>  This scandal involves a whole systems failure to which I will return because I am not happy that some person, organisation or government allowed it to happen.  I will address it now in case I run out of time.<\/p><p>The comment was made by the women that, when we rolled out CervicalCheck in 2008, we also guaranteed the banks in the same month.  As we pulled back on resources, staff and money for cervical smear tests, we had no problem rolling out money for the bank guarantee.  Notwithstanding that, they struggled on gallantly to provide a screening service as an independent entity, reporting to an independent board with an independent chair that had oversight and outside monitoring.  Subsequent Governments of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il in their wisdom saw the need to change and allow the Health Service Executive to change its structure, with the resulting consequence that there was less accountability and no independent board to which to report.  In fact, before the board was abolished, we had directors of services talking to civil servants in the health sector.  There was no accountability whatsoever.  We have not had a single accountable person in CervicalCheck for the past number of years.  I ask the Minister where the responsibility lies for that.  We have also had a number of vacancies.<\/p> <p> We then had an open disclosure policy that was really a close policy.  It was a case of do not tell, or only tell if it we have to, and only after all of this correspondence between CervicalCheck and the consultants and general practitioners, and we will not tell the women.  It was a case that we had a policy of open disclosure but that it really meant that we do not tell at all because there might be screaming headlines and difficult issues we have to cope with and, in true Irish fashion, on a certain level we will not cope with anything like that.  It was a case that we will pretend it is not happening and if the person is dead, just put it on their medical notes.  That is what is reported throughout this report.<\/p> <p> Those of us in the D&aacute;il asked for mandatory disclosure.  The Minister saw fit not to support us and now we will have to bring it in by way of legislation and force the situation.<\/p> <p> There were serious governance gaps at every level.  There were serious problems with a risk register and what was put on a risk register.  A systemic failure was not identified as something that should go on a risk register.  Can the Minister imagine that?<\/p> <p> There was an absence or a limited amount of public health medicine and a limited amount of input from public health physicians.  Parallel with the bank guarantee, the withdrawal of the money for the service and the outsourcing at the lowest cost, which I will come back to, we were getting less and less accountability.<\/p> <p> I sat on a health forum for ten years.  I became a member when it was set up and spent ten years of my life on it.  In my first year on the forum we were under pressure from the people working in the laboratory in Galway and elsewhere not to outsource this service.  They said not to outsource, that they were in the process of building up their expertise, and that this should remain in Ireland or else they would envisage serious problems.  Notwithstanding that, it was outsourced.  Now, Dr. Scally, who is very cautious and gives positive results to the laboratories on what his limited time allowed him to do, confirms that one of the firms, the Australian one, Sonic Healthcare, has been in the process of repatriating the system to Dublin with one of its companies because it sees it is far easier to have it based in the country rather than going to New York, for example, with Quest Diagnostics, where there are delays of two or three days and so on.  If we read Dr. Scally's report we see that even the private companies are coming back to Dublin.  I cannot recall the actual name of it.  The CPL one is gone.  It is the sister company that is now back in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900043#VV01700","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1537373700,"counter":414,"content":"<p>MedLab Pathology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900044#WW00200","nonspeaker":"A Deputy"},{"type":"speech","time":1537373700,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank the Minister for taking this debate.  There are a number of issues regarding this report and the first and most important concerns open disclosure.  Mandatory open disclosure will now be part of the patient safety Bill, which will come before the Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny next Wednesday.  That will be a very important meeting in terms of defining open disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding CervicalCheck, and I am not in any way trying to explain what happened, there is a difference between organisational open disclosure and individual open disclosure.  In terms of what happened in CervicalCheck, the lines of responsibility on disclosure were blurred.  They should have been clarified and quickly identified.  The failure to identify the lack of open disclosure in CervicalCheck was because there was no independent oversight of the scheme and there were no patient advocates on the structures of CervicalCheck who would have spotted that difficulty very early on, because when one openly discloses an incident, it is usually contemporaneous.  Something happens and, within a few days, it has been identified that there has been a problem and one openly discloses.  CervicalCheck, however, referred to historical events that had happened several years ago.  It failed to identify the difficulties that would pose and who was to be the responsible person regarding disclosure.  That has led to this failure.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty was in respect of disclosing to women but also the communication gaps that developed within CervicalCheck regarding where the lines of responsibility lay and the appalling shortcomings in the manner in which disclosure was eventually made when the scandal broke.  It was rushed, ham-fisted, amateurish and did not reflect very well on the medical profession.<\/p>  <p>  The second point is that Dr. Scally identified CervicalCheck as a dysfunctional organisation that lacked governance and accountability, that there was no clear responsibility among the various sectors in CervicalCheck and no clear job description.  There was a lack of clarity in the way people should function within the system, in particular, how information was transmitted up and down the line.  Dr. Scally identified a whole systems failure, and he was restrained in identifying particular individuals.  If particular individuals are to be found wanting, I have no problem with that, but the blurring of lines in terms of the organisation, governance and accountability of CervicalCheck make that very difficult.  There was nobody in charge.  There was an absence of governance and poor oversight by the HSE.<\/p><p>There is an absolute urgency in reinstating the HSE board.  I note that the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill will also come before the D&aacute;il very soon.  It is absolutely essential that we have a reorganised, slimmed down, very clear governance structure within the HSE, not just in respect of its board but going right down through the organisation.  It is a substantial part of the Sl&aacute;intecare report that there has to be huge governance reform within the HSE.  As we have spoken about that on many occasions I will not go into it again.<\/p> <p> There is a necessity for no-fault compensation in respect of what happened. To have women go through the adversarial court system, as we have seen Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and others do, is not fair.  We are talking about dealing with people who have offered themselves voluntarily, who are perfectly healthy when they go for screening, in the same way that when children present for vaccination they are perfectly healthy children.  If they suffer an injury, whatever the case may be, there should be no-fault compensation.  They should not have to go through the adversarial system.  Mr. Justice Charles Meenan is to report on alternative methods.  We have to look at how we deal with people who are injured by our health system.  They should not have to go through the adversarial system.  Gabriel Scally identifies that.<\/p> <p> Another aspect of the report is data sharing.  There was a breakdown in data sharing in that the National Cancer Registry and cervical screening service had different lists of people who had cervical cancer and they were not sharing that information with each other.  Even the gathering of data was a problem in respect of CervicalCheck and the gathering of data is a big problem in the health service in general.  We discussed that briefly at our health committee meeting this morning.  Data is king.  Without data, we cannot plan a health service.  That was a deficiency within CervicalCheck.<\/p> <p> I refer to a journalist who wrote about this during the week.  He wrote that the shortcomings of CervicalCheck indicate a whole-of-system failure, a wider failure within the health service, where the welfare of patients got lost in the political and bureaucratic manoeuvres operating in a cocoon of detachment.  That summarises what happened here.  There was no outside vigilance on what was happening within cervical screening.  People got locked into a bubble and were not thinking properly or putting the patient at the centre of the service.  It is so important, whatever service we provide, that we put the patient at the centre.  That is why it is important that we have two patient advocates on the HSE board.  We should have two patient advocates on every board at local, regional and national level to make sure this does not happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900044#WW00400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537374300,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I am happy to make a few remarks on this very important issue this afternoon.  The Scally report has laid bare a scandalous catalogue of failures right across some of the most sensitive areas of health care in this country.  The women and the families who have been affected and, in some cases, utterly devastated by these failures are the true heroes of this entire sorry saga and their bravery cannot be commended enough.<\/p>  <p>  The report indicates that we have reached a tipping point in the level of dysfunction that afflicts the HSE.  We have all known that for a long time and the Minister must know it after two years in office.  When will he do something about it?  Dr. Scally observed how apparent it is that there are serious gaps in the governance structures of the screening services.  In the specific case of CervicalCheck, there was a demonstrable deficit of clear governance and reporting lines between it, the National Screening Service and the higher management structures of the HSE.  This confusion, according to Dr. Scally, complicated the reporting of issues and multiplied the risks.  We need to let that sink in.  Here we have a so-called healthcare service that actually multiplied the risks to women and their families.  They were going in there for checks in their own interest.  As the Deputy from Galway stated earlier, she is not here to tell people to go for checks; it is up to people themselves but they must have confidence.  To think that this is where they ended up - how can we have confidence?<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally also noted that there were serious gaps in the range of expertise in the professional and managerial staff directly engaged in the operation of CervicalCheck.  In one of his recommendations, Dr. Scally says the Department of Health and the HSE should revise their policies in respect of document management.  The implication here is that HSE document management at present is not reliable and does not ensure accountability.  I honestly feel that is a deliberate act at this stage, so that there cannot be any accountability.  Indeed, Dr. Scally says the view was expressed to the scoping inquiry by some working within National Screening Service that screening was downgraded after being absorbed into the HSE and that they felt they had little influence within the HSE as a whole.  That is a common practice.  We have seen that no matter what service is absorbed into this monstrosity, it just gets lost.  There are lots of good people who have been absorbed into the HSE but it is such an unaccountable and unwieldy organisation now that it must disbanded.  <\/p>  <p>  Among other findings, the report noted that there continues to be a somewhat negative relationship and clear disconnect described by the programs between themselves and the HSE chain of command.  Issues of isolation, suspicion, lack of trust or support and poor or non-existent communications were cited.  We are going to continue with this.  The Minister walked into Cashel hospital one day with Deputy Healy, myself and others and he was shocked to see it lying idle.  There are so many instances and the Minister has done absolutely nothing about it - an abject failure.  Then there was the selective leaking of the report.  I am not blaming the Minister but it was only a handful of people who had it.  That was despicable as well.  It is a case of covering backsides all the time and allowing the HSE senior management and the Department to cover themselves and then wheel in the barristers in court if anything happens.  It is despicable, degrading and disgusting.  The Minister is presiding over that.  I have called on him several times to resign and if he had any moral compass he would do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900045#XX00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1537374300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>To clarify, there are 26 minutes left and the Order of the House gives the Minister 20 minutes.

It is excellent and extremely comprehensive.  It has established many of the facts and truths of the CervicalCheck issue.  I believe it has gone a very long way to answering many of the questions we have all had over recent months.  The most important thing about the report is that it puts women and families front and centre in respect of this entire matter.  Most importantly, Dr. Scally met with the women and families concerned.  He listened to them and recorded their views and feelings.  He really gave them a very strong voice in this whole process.  Their experiences as recorded by Dr. Scally are undoubtedly a disgrace and raise many important issues for us.<\/p>  <p>  The most significant finding and one of the most significant recommendations is the need for early legislation for mandatory open disclosure.  It is extremely regrettable that, at the end of last year, the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il conspired to delete the provision for mandatory open disclosure and, instead, as a result of a strong lobby, went with a voluntary disclosure regime.  The shortcomings of that have been shown up very starkly.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the heads of the patient safety Bill.  It provides legal liability in respect of disclosing basic information to patients.  It is very important that we get clarification from the Minister that the legal liability will actually apply to individual clinicians and not to healthcare providers.  That, I think, is the obvious interpretation of the heads of the Bill as they stand at the moment but it is not good enough.  The Minister has to go much further than that.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is absolutely critical in changing the culture that Dr. Scally discovered.  He has lifted the lid on a highly paternalistic culture which, as he said himself, was bordering on misogynist, in respect of many of the 30 consultants who were involved in this.<\/p><p>Stephen Teap referred to the God complex that was a factor in this matter.  We are all too familiar with the God complex that some members of the profession display.  Not only did these doctors fail to disclose key medical information to their patients but when, thanks to Vicky Phelan, this issue came out into the open, the attitude and approach of those consultants were disgraceful.  There must be early follow through in respect of those clinicians engaging with and apologising to the women and families concerned, as recommended by Dr. Scally.  <\/p> <p> Dr. Scally found major shortcomings in CervicalCheck relating to governance, quality assurance, risk assessment, understaffing and accountability.  This was only a microcosm of the HSE.  Dr. Scally said that everywhere he went within the HSE, there were problems.  Many of these issues have been addressed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report but we need to ensure we take the steps recommended by Dr. Scally with the principal one being the reinstatement of the independent oversight board.  It is important to point out that 88 Members of this House voted to abolish that independent oversight board five years ago.  There must, therefore, be accountability in here as well in other places.  The political mishandling of this issue needs attention.  There was certainly competitive outrage and many of the comments and much of the behaviour of Members of this House, including members of the Government, did little to help the situation.  <\/p> <p> The issue is how the Government and Minister respond to these 50 recommendations.  The Minister needs to tell us what mechanism he will put in place to ensure those recommendations are implemented swiftly and we keep the focus on this issue until they are implemented in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900045#XX00600","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537374900,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I want to focus on one important political point that has not received much attention.  There is a clear recognition that a mistake was made in 2011 when the HSE board was abolished.  That mistake must be rectified and Dr. Scally puts that front and centre.  I say this because to a certain extent, we must be careful that in our work we do not always view the public service as bad or believe that structures relating to it will inevitably be bad.  At the time, the then Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, said he would take all the responsibility, that he was sweeping away all those structures and that he would be the great single-handed orchestrator of everything.  We must be careful in the political system and we must work with our public servants to make sure we deliver the services our people need.<\/p>  <p>  This colours my second comment, which is that the Scally report has done the country a great service because it highlights a problem in our public service relating to the nature of communications between doctor and patient, particularly, as has been said on several occasions here, between male doctors and female patients in terms of the sharing of information.  It concerns attitude.  It is very hard to define that, to regulate for it and to be scientific about what empathy is, how one listens and how one fulfils the Hippocratic Oath in sharing information that belongs to a patient with him or her.  There is a huge amount of learning here because how we share data in the modern world is of increasing importance, as is the ownership of data.  The ability to get access to one's data, particularly health data, should be enshrined after this crisis - this terrible disaster for those patients.  Hopefully, we will get one good thing out of it, namely, a system under which patients have full transparency and access to data.  Where the State makes a mistake, and in some instances the mistake will be unavoidable because there will be screenings that are inaccurate, we must develop a mechanism whereby the State can share information about those failings without it becoming a legal wrangle and where it is not doing down the State or the public service to admit mistakes.  I hope this is at least one positive outcome of what has been a terribly trying process for the more than 250 women involved.  <\/p>  <p>  The way in which the report was written, with the women and their comments being put centre stage, was correct.  It indicates the general approach we should take in terms of the medical profession, the sharing of data and how the public administrative system works.  Dr. Scally has done us a great service, as have those women who did an incredibly difficult thing in speaking publicly about their tragedies.  They have done us a service, as has Dr. Scally.  We should live up to that in the work we do from now on.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900046#YY00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1537374900,"counter":425,"content":"<p>It is important to commend the bravery and determination of Vicky Phelan and the other women involved.

I also welcome the certainty of mandatory open disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally rightly highlights the outrageous treatment of women by their doctors and correctly states that the doctors involved should apologise to the women involved.  That must happen.  We also need accountability for this debacle.  I have no doubt that we need a full public inquiry that can compel witnesses and documentation.  Without such an inquiry, senior management, Ministers, Secretaries General and chief medical officers will be able to avoid having to take responsibility for what has happened.  Without such an inquiry, having to make fundamental changes to the health governance model can also be avoided.  I believe this model is at the root of this scandal.  It would also mean that there would be no investigation of the highly problematic outsourcing of these tests, which is a very important point.  Without such an inquiry, similar outrages and scandals will happen in the future.

That is what I want to do.<\/p>  <p>  This is a scandal about women not being told and about what Dr. Scally called a laudable audit in terms of its objectives being botched in terms of its execution and the pain it caused.  I take Deputy Connolly's point about it not being the job of Members of the Oireachtas to promote screening but there were Members of the Oireachtas - not Deputy Connolly - who allowed the perception that laboratories were not safe to seep out.  I do not know about the Deputy but the largest number of queries I received in my office and from women in my own life involved queries about how safe their smear tests would be in terms of the labs to which they were going.  Dr. Scally, who we asked to do a job, said they are safe, which is a really important point for us to make.  <\/p>  <p>  All Members focused on implementation, which is key to this.  I was asked what the implementation structure will be.  Dr. Scally has offered to continue to work for the next 12 months on the delivery of the recommendations and to oversee their delivery from an external point of view.  I have taken him up on that offer and intend to meet him in the next week or so to finalise how best to do that.  Patients will be involved.  I would suggest that he attend the Oireachtas Committee on Health.  He has already been invited by the Chairman and I know Dr. Scally would be very willing to attend.  I suggest that, through that committee, the Oireachtas could play an oversight role in making sure we are making progress and sending reports.

Therefore, outsourcing is not at the heart of this scandal.  We can have ideological debates all day long about outsourcing, but the source of the scandal is non-disclosure of personal information - women's information - that was withheld from them.

Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall is entirely correct and I will work with her and anyone else in this House to ensure it will apply to individuals.  They did not do this in the United Kingdom where they watered it down.  We need it to apply to individuals and, I believe, institutions.  That is my intention and it is Dr. Scally's recommendation.  I will work with the Deputy and others to make sure it will happen.<\/p>  <p>  As we have all said, we do not just need legal change, we also need cultural change.  While it might not have had legal underpinning, clearly the policy of open disclosure was not implemented and was contradictory.  I do not buy into the narrative that we blame all doctors and that all doctors are bad.  We have many dedicated healthcare professionals.  However, the ones who said what we read in the report and the ones who said what Deputy Joe O'Reilly illustrated to me on the issue affecting women who used transvaginal mesh - those who speak to women like that - have let us all and their profession down.  We need a cultural change.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear that there will be a further investigation because Dr. Scally is clear on it.  While I do not have it in front of me, from memory, there are at least three places where he calls for a further inquiry.  The CPL laboratory is not used today and we cannot let anyone suggest it is.  That is one issue.  <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of procurement in general, Dr. Scally is not suggesting anything was illegal, but, clearly, more work needs to be done on the issue of procurement and contracts.  He also makes the point about having a common data set in order that we can see the same data about all of the laboratories in a transparent way.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald asked about the issue of leaking.  Let me say whoever leaked it was absolutely cruel.  While I do not speak for the patient advocates, like many in the House, I have got to know them extraordinarily well.  Obviously, the report was not leaked, but someone who knew something about some element of it leaked it.  It was suggested that was the report.  It caused huge upset and was absolutely cruel to do it.<\/p>  <p>  On governance, I agree with the points made about the HSE board and that there is a need to have two patient representatives on it.  We need to use the report as momentum in delivering in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Catherine Connolly and Alan Kelly asked about the continuance of the audit.  Dr. Scally said the idea of an audit was laudable and we all get that, given that we know the way that it was done was so poor.  There were two key recommendations on the issue of an audit among his 50 recommendations, recommendations Nos. 26 and 27.  They state, effectively, that patients must be at the heart of developing and designing audits.  We will work to deliver this before an audit recommences.  It is very important that the audit be correct and that we do not see a repeat of the mistakes made.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of political mishandling, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall makes a fair point.  I include myself in that regard.  Mistakes were made by everyone, including me.  I think many of us made mistakes in trying to do the right thing, but there are serious lessons to be learned by all of us, on all sides of this House, and elements of the media in how we deal with an issue in a calm, rational manner and establish the facts, which is what the people affected always want to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900047#ZZ00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1537375500,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I would like to come back to the women involved and the briefing.

The changes encompassed by these amendments are required to provide for an extension of the mortgage interest deferral relief for local property tax liabilities for one year in respect of 2019 LPT liabilities.  The proposals also involve continuing to provide for the administration and collection of LPT by employers in line with PAYE modernisation changes which are due to come into effect on 1 January 2019.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that provisions concerning the LPT are not appropriate for inclusion in the Finance Bill.  As the proposed provisions must have an operative date of 1 January 2019, they must be provided for in law before that date.  Hence, we propose their inclusion in the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018.<\/p><p>It is currently possible to defer, in certain circumstances, the payment of LPT liabilities.  Deferral is most commonly availed of by property owners whose annual income is less than &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether this is a married couple, civil partners or certain cohabitants.  The income threshold can be increased in the case of property owners paying mortgage interest.  In relation to such mortgage interest payees, the higher income threshold will cease to apply for tax years after 2018, unlike the standard income threshold which will continue for an additional year.  The next valuation date for LPT is 1 November 2019, which will determine tax liabilities for the years 2020 to 2021.  Arrangements in this regard are being considered as part of the review of LPT being carried out by an inter-departmental group.  Consideration is also being give to how payment deferrals will operate in future.  Pending the Minister's consideration of the report of the review group and any Government decisions that may arise therefrom, the higher income threshold applied by section 133 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 is being extended until 31 December 2019 in line with the standard income threshold.  This proposed amendment is contained in section 36.<\/p><p>The bulk of the proposed amendments are necessary to allow for the continued collection of LPT when the PAYE system is modernised with effect from 1 January 2019.  There are a range of methods for paying LPT and, as many people choose to have their LPT liability deducted from their wages under the PAYE system, this will be affected by the PAYE modernisation project.  This project is the most significant reform of the PAYE system since its introduction in 1960 and is designed to deliver benefits for employees, employers, policy makers and the Revenue Commissioners.  PAYE modernisation is designed to ensure that employers, employees and Revenue will have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information available relating to payment of wages, income tax, PRSI, USC and LPT deductions.  This will ensure the right amounts are collected at the right time from employees and that employers pay their correct liabilities when required.  It will further allow Revenue to manage taxpayers' records in an effective manner to ensure individuals pay only the correct amount of tax and receive the full benefit of their entitlements during the year.<\/p><p>The PAYE modernisation changes were introduced by the Finance Act 2017 and involve a move for employers to a real-time electronic system for engaging with Revenue from 1 January 2019.  As will happen with income tax, PRSI and USC, employers who are directed to deduct local property tax from the salary of a liable person will be required to notify Revenue of the making of the relevant deduction on or before the making of salary payments to that liable person.  Employers must also file a monthly return to report the local property tax deducted each month.<\/p> <p> The changes to the collection of local property tax mirror income tax changes introduced in the Finance Act 2017.  The changes do not make any changes to the local property tax system itself.  Rather, they simply involve a change to the way in which the local property tax deducted by employers is reported to Revenue and the documentation to be used for this purpose.  The tax itself will be deducted at the same time as heretofore and the amount will be exactly the same, with no change in rates, computation or reliefs.<\/p> <p> The amendments related to local property tax are procedural and technical in nature and are necessary to facilitate the continued operation of the PAYE system, including the deduction of local property tax by employers and its remittance to Revenue.  The legislative changes underpinning the continued administration and collection of income tax under PAYE modernisation were enacted in the Finance Act 2017.  The changes proposed for the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018 simply mirror for local property tax the changes already enacted for income tax in the Finance Act 2017 in this regard.<\/p> <p> I hope my remarks have been of assistance to Members.  We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage of the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018 tomorrow to discuss further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900048#AAA00900","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537376700,"counter":462,"content":"<p>It is important to put the motion in context.  We are not discussing the substance of the Bill or indeed of the proposed amendments at this point.  What we are discussing is a motion which would allow the committee to consider the amendments in question.  That is my understanding of what the House must decide on.  In this sense it is a technical question on which the House needs to decide.  From a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective, we have no difficulty supporting the motion to allow the amendments to be taken on Committee Stage of the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018, which will be taken tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to express the serious disappointment of our party with the delay in bringing forward this legislation.  We are now heading for the first anniversary of the announcement of this initiative for the provision of finance for the construction of residential developments.  It has taken this long.  I know the process of drafting legislation, taking it through all the various channels within the apparatus of Government, is not quick or straightforward.  I ask the House to consider, however, the evidence given by representatives of the Construction Industry Federation to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight yesterday.  I asked them about the environment for finance, for construction, and they made it clear that while the pillar banks are lending a certain proportion of the costs of developments, perhaps up to 60%, the balance, as the Minister of State well knows, in many cases is coming from international funds and is very expensive debt.  It can be 10%, 12%, even 14% or higher; therefore, this Bill and what it provides for is urgently needed.  That is why we want to see Committee and Remaining Stages taken as quickly as possible.  Obviously, we must get this right, but we need that funding to be available.  It is quite a modest measure overall but is necessary and important.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth remarking on the proposed amendments which give rise to this motion.  They are related to the local property tax, which would not normally sit within this Bill but rather within more relevant legislation.  I understand, however, that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that the Finance Bill is not the appropriate place for these changes and that, because these amendments were not envisaged and were not really part of the original Bill as published, this motion is required to allow the committee to take them.  The amendments themselves are technical in nature and provide that mortgage interest deferral relief can continue through 2019, pending further changes to the local property tax.  This really just allows for a continuation of the existing system for mortgage interest deferral relief, providing for the higher qualifying thresholds, which would allow people to defer the LPT bill.  This deferral mechanism is a very important provision for many families paying for mortgages and in many cases paying high interest rates.  We therefore support the retention of this relief through 2019 and in advance of whatever reforms being brought in being enacted.<\/p>  <p>  We are very much aware of the PAYE modernisation programme, which will come into effect on 1 January next year, and the provision whereby LPT can be deducted from salary by an employer.  That this has a legal basis through 2019 is important and is a measure we support.  Under the existing provisions, as I understand, it is due to end at the end of this year, whereas any change to the LPT will not kick in until 2020, following the re-evaluation if it takes place, as is currently envisaged, in November 2019.<\/p>  <p>  We look forward to the review of the LPT.  We made a submission as a party in this regard some months ago.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the proposals we made, which included increasing the qualifying income threshold by which people could avail of the deferral mechanism because it is quite low.  It is as low as &euro;15,000 for a single person who does not have a mortgage.  There are many people, particularly elderly people, with high fixed costs who may have a modest occupational pension on top of the State pension but for whom the LPT bill is a serious burden.  I do not think it comes as a cost to the State if that deferral mechanism exists.  The money will be collected.  It is the first charge on the property, and consideration should be given to increasing the deferral thresholds.  We have suggested such an increase.  Similarly, we have suggested a change to the rate of interest charged - or the interest penalty, as such - for a deferral, which is currently 4% a year.  I understand it is simple interest but, given the environment of very low interest rates we are in, I do not believe this is justified.  I think the Government should look to reduce it.  We have suggested 2%, which in our view strikes the right balance between there being some cost associated with a deferral but not an unnecessarily punitive one.  We will come to these issues when the LPT is actually being reviewed.  I am not sure if the Minister has the report yet.  The Sunday newspapers certainly seem to have it, or have received leaks from it in recent weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900049#BBB00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1537376700,"counter":463,"content":"<p>We do not have it yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900049#BBB00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1537376700,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister of State will publish it and we can all consider it when it becomes available.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, we look forward to debating the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill on Committee and Remaining Stages.

I got a call last week asking if I would have a problem with this Bill going through the D&aacute;il without debate.  I said I did have a problem with it going through without debate because it deals with two issues that are of considerable importance to the people of this country.  One of these issues is the local property tax, a tax which, frankly, is despised by huge numbers of people, which I resolutely oppose, and which is causing very great hardship for huge numbers of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Although this particular measure just talks about extending the deferral period for people, we need to point out that, in most cases, these people have to defer it because they do not have enough money to pay it.  I was just checking the Revenue statistics for this.  In discussing the local property tax we need to point out that 96% of the deferrals being sought in respect of the property tax, and for which there is now going be an extension, are sought by people because their incomes are so low that they cannot afford to pay it.  This was our point about the property tax when we marched, when we opposed it and when we encouraged a boycott which the Government cleverly got around by handing the tax over to Revenue.  The Minister of State should not think for one minute that bringing in the heavy hand of Revenue to collect it from people forcefully makes it okay.<\/p>  <p>  It is certainly not okay for people who are clocking up a debt in respect of this property tax, a debt arising from the fact that they do not have enough money to pay it.  What is fair about that?  That debt is clocking up and it is now going to clock up an extra year.  Those who cannot pay it are probably glad that they can defer it for an extra year but the debt is clocking up.  These deferrals are for people whose income is less than &euro;15,000.  How does anybody survive on &euro;15,000, never mind pay a property tax?<\/p>  <p>  It is worth taking the opportunity to say this tax was justified at the time it was introduced on the basis that it would be a sustainable source of income and that it would be a progressive tax.  The proposers said that it was a tax on wealth.  It is not.  It is a tax on the least well off who are then forced to defer it because they cannot pay.  To that can be added the fact that 85,000 have it taken forcefully out of their wages by their employers at the behest of Revenue.  Why?  The Minister of State can be certain that it is because they are low-income workers who cannot afford it.<\/p>  <p>  Is Deputy Mick Barry speaking on this?

This is a market-based policy aimed at fixing a housing crisis which was caused by the market in the first place.  It aims to route more public resources to private developers who have failed to invest during the greatest housing crisis the State has ever seen.  The Bill aims to finance developers to whom, in many cases, banks will not lend at the moment.  The Bill provides for a better deal for developers than that currently offered to them by the banks.  Why else would they use the proposed new lending system?  In this sense the Bill aims to nationalise risk.  It would be far better to use the &euro;750 million which the Bill provides for loans to developers for direct State-led investment on public lands.  In this way, social and genuinely affordable housing can be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Just a few days ago, property developer Cairn reported its 2018 half-year results.  The report showed that Cairn owns zoned landbanks suitable for more than 14,000 homes.  Some 95% of these are in or close to Dublin.  It completed just 399 homes up to September 2018, which represents less than 3% of its zoned home capacity.  In its report it stated \"housing market conditions remain very positive\".  What better illustrates the fact that the housing crisis benefits the wealthy few at the expense of the many than that particular quote?  Cairn also tells shareholders that the shortfall in new homes required during the past five years was more than 100,000 homes and that a large shortfall is expected to remain for many years.  This is good news for Cairn, which says that it expects to achieve average new home sale prices of &euro;428,000 in 2018-2019, far above what is affordable for most people.  It is no surprise, therefore, that Cairn reported a sevenfold increase in profits to &euro;18.1 million in the first half of 2018.  The total assets it owns are now worth &euro;1 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Developers like this are brimming with confidence.  They are allowed to continue hoarding land and drip-feeding the supply of new homes to make sure that prices and profits keep rising and that the crisis keeps going.  The Home Building Finance Ireland Bill will achieve nothing other than making more public funding available to increase developers' profits.  Developers are part of the problem, not the solution.  The Government needs to stop throwing public funds at them.  We oppose this Bill and demand that developer-owned zoned landbanks be brought into public ownership and developed rapidly with genuinely affordable housing.  A manufactured housing crisis will not end until we have new public house building on a large scale.  The Government needs to stop greasing the palms of its developer friends and start building public homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900050#CCC00800","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1537377300,"counter":474,"content":"<p>It is almost a year since home building finance Ireland was first announced.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, told us that it would deliver 6,000 homes with funding of &euro;750 million.  It has not delivered any houses yet.  At the time, the Minister of State might remember, I thought that maybe this might be a worthwhile exercise because I thought the funding would be given to the builders.  I find the Government's failure to deal properly with the housing crisis and the dysfunctional nature of how housing is supplied in this country soul-destroying at this stage.  We have had a problem for a long time.  It did not start under the Government.  It started a long time ago, but it is continuing under the two Governments there have been since I was elected to the House.  They have failed to deal with it properly.<\/p><p>This proposal is about lending money to people to build.  The Government's Land Development Agency will seek to have buildings provided on State lands, with the figures of 10%, 30% and 60% for social, affordable and private housing, respectively.  Considering that private developers and landbankers are sitting on so much land as they watch its value rise, why is the Government giving in to them and providing them with State land on which to build private housing?  I am all for building private housing.  However, the State is not the one that should be building it.  I am okay with the Government giving money to builders to build houses on condition that it would be affordable.<\/p> <p> What is affordable?  Last week the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, spoke about an affordable price being between &euro;325,000 and &euro;350,000.  That is not affordable for most people today.  The price will not stand still either.  There is a big difference between the builder and the developer, but the Government keeps mixing them up, as did the previous one.  The developer is looking for a profit of between &euro;60,000 and &euro;80,000 per unit.  The builder is not.  The Minister of State and I know plenty of builders who, if they made a profit of &euro;10,000 on every unit they built, they would be happy bunnies.  However, that is the not the case with developers.  The Government talks about engaging developers, but it is not going to small builders who can work for a fair price.  Instead, it is going to the big boys, just as NAMA did.<\/p> <p> The principle on which NAMA has been working for the past four years is not much different from this proposal or that for the Land Development Agency.  NAMA has given money to its favourite chosen ones to build on its land.  For example, it funded a development at Maryborough Hill in Cork, where the price of four-bedroom houses starts at &euro;470,000.  Why would a State body give money to a developer to provide housing at a cost of &euro;470,000?  I cannot understand it.  NAMA funded the Piper's Hill development in County Kildare and got Sean Mulryan to build it.  The price of a three-bedroom house starts at &euro;345,000.  NAMA funded the Coill Dubh development in Malahide where in 2016 four-bedroom houses were going for &euro;465,000.  There are other schemes, several of which I have mentioned before, where the position is the same.  There is no rationale for this and it is actually inflating the price.  The Government is throwing diesel on the fire by allowing the likes of NAMA to fund developments where developers can end up charging a price that is unaffordable for most people.  It does not stack up.<\/p> <p> The Government has an immense amount of land on which to build.  It claims, however, that local authorities are not fit for purpose when it comes to housebuilding.  I cannot understand why it does not make them fit for purpose.  They cannot build the housing, meaning that they will hire builders, not developers, to do so.  Why does the Government not opt for that model?  If the expertise is not available in the local authorities, why will it not provide it in and have it run on a county basis?  The local authorities could then hire builders in their areas to build schemes and provide houses at a certain price.  They could pick one builder out of ten at a fair price.  It is not rocket science.<\/p> <p> Since 2011, the position has got worse.  The Government is not dealing with the issue in the right way.  I am frustrated because I know how the industry operates and where the bodies are buried.  The Government is just throwing diesel on the fire, which does not make any sense.  I wish it would stop listening to the wrong people.  It is listening to people who have a vested interest in housing being very expensive.  I can guarantee that within three years from now the price of property will fall again.  We have not dealt with the fundamental problems of the last recession and are not handling this matter properly.  We are moving in the wrong direction and walking into trouble.  We are not going to be supplying affordable housing in the next couple of years, which is crazy.  Somebody needs to get a grip and stop listening to the vested interests who want property to be very expensive.<\/p> <p> In July I brought forward a Bill which proposed a 25% tax on land banks.  That is where the expensive supply of housing starts.  Fine Gael obviously represents a better-off clientele than other parties.  I can assure the Minister of State that 99% of Fine Gael supporters would benefit from cheaper housing if the Government dealt with this problem.  The kids of the wealthy cannot get mortgages and cannot afford most of the houses which have been built.  It is nuts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900050#CCC00900","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537377900,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2018: Order for Second Stage","time":1537377900,"counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900051#DDD00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537377900,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to amend the Coroners Act 1962 and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537377900,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900051#DDD00400","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537377900,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2018: Second Stage","time":1537378500,"counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900052#EEE00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1537378500,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who very much regrets he is unable to be here in person, I am pleased to have this opportunity to move the motion regarding Second Stage of the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2018.  The Bill makes a series of amendments to the Coroners Act 1962, in a far-reaching and important modernisation of our coronial law.<\/p><p>  First, the Bill will significantly strengthen and clarify the powers available to coroners in the reporting, investigation and inquest of deaths.  Second, it responds to the Private Member&rsquo;s Bill brought by Deputy Clare Daly regarding maternal deaths, and addresses similar concerns that have arisen in some perinatal or infant deaths.  Third, it will provide for a wider scope of inquiry, where necessary, at inquest, and makes a range of other changes that will enhance our compliance with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Minister, I wish to acknowledge the contribution of Deputy Clare Daly, through her earlier Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, on the issue of maternal deaths.  Arising from her Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, significant work was undertaken in the Department of Justice and Equality to introduce a suite of reforming legislative provisions in addition to her proposals.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is deeply committed to these reforms and he has informed me that Deputy Clare Daly and her office kept in very regular contact with his Department to ensure that this Bill reached the floor of the House at the earliest opportunity.  I again thank Deputy Clare Daly on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for her steadfast commitment to these issues and for her work.<\/p><p>Deputy Clare Daly's Bill addressed the findings of inquests and inquiries in a number of high-profile recent cases that have caused great public unease.  Some maternal deaths occurring in hospitals, which should have been reported to coroners - because they raised issues of medical error and were &quot;unnatural deaths&quot; under the Coroners Act 1962 - were not so reported.  I am conscious that these cases remain live for many of the people present tonight.  Bereaved families and, in some instances, even coroners, experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining basic information that should have been provided to them.  This was, and is, not acceptable.<\/p><p>Deputy Clare Daly&rsquo;s Bill received broad support from all sides of the House and was not opposed by the Government.  The Government Bill I am introducing tonight accordingly incorporates all the amendments sought by the Deputy regarding maternal deaths.<\/p><p>This Bill will require mandatory reporting to a coroner, mandatory post mortem examination and mandatory inquest in all cases of maternal or late maternal death.  It also will extend the legal aid scheme for family members at certain inquests to cases of maternal or late maternal death.  The coroner will have a discretion to make an exception to mandatory inquest, after consulting with the family, if having regard to specified conditions, including the views of the family, the coroner is satisfied that the death is a natural one.<\/p><p>In addition, the Bill provides for mandatory reporting to a coroner of all stillbirths, intrapartum deaths, and infant deaths.  As I mentioned, this requirement responds to similar public concerns, which have arisen in a number of cases regarding perinatal and infant hospital deaths.  However, we are not proposing mandatory post mortem examination or inquest in these particularly sensitive cases.  Post mortem examination and inquest in such cases will remain, as currently, at the coroner&rsquo;s discretion.  The wishes of the bereaved parents are a key consideration for coroners in such cases.<\/p><p>These provisions fit logically into the overall purpose of the Bill, which sets out in a more clear, comprehensive, specific and stringent manner the legal framework for reporting and investigation of certain deaths.<\/p><p>Section 6 specifies the situations where a death must be reported to the coroner.  They include any death which appears to be violent or unnatural, where the circumstances may in the public interest require investigation or simply where the death is unexpected and the cause is unknown.  In addition, the Bill inserts a new Schedule setting out specific types of death which must be reported to the coroner, including, for example, all maternal or late maternal deaths and all infant deaths.  Section 6 also sets out clearly what persons are legally responsible for reporting a mandatory reportable death to the coroner, and provides for updated penalties where this is not done.<\/p><p>  In a limited range of situations, which I will outline shortly, the Bill provides for mandatory inquiry or mandatory inquest by the coroner.  I should emphasise that in the vast majority of other cases, mandatory reporting does not result in a post mortem examination or an inquest.  Most reported deaths are cleared by the coroner, but mandatory reporting does ensure that in situations of concern or doubt, coroners have the necessary information to assess whether the death is one that requires further inquiry.<\/p><p>Regarding post mortem examination, section 16 inserts a new section 33A which sets out in a clearer, more comprehensive and more stringent manner a limited range of situations where a post mortem examination is always required.  These include deaths which following inquiry by the coroner, appear to be violent or unnatural, or where the death is unexpected and the cause is unknown.  They will also include, more specifically, any death occurring in State custody or detention, any maternal death or late maternal death, as well as certain deaths where a post mortem examination is a statutory requirement.  The coroner retains a discretion to direct a post mortem examination into other deaths, under proposed section 33.<\/p><p>Regarding inquests, section 7 amends the 1962 Act to expressly set out the situations where an inquest is already required by law - including where the death appears to be violent or unnatural, or to have occurred unexpectedly and from unknown causes, or in certain situations where an inquest is a statutory requirement - and specifies that, in addition, an inquest must be held into any death occurring in State custody or detention, and into any maternal death or late maternal death.  The coroner retains a discretion to direct an inquest in other cases under section 8.<\/p><p>The Bill introduces other important reforms.  It strengthens the coroner&rsquo;s powers to summon witnesses to an inquest, to direct production of relevant documents or to enter premises and take possession of relevant records.  It updates sanctions for a person obstructing an inquest.  It also requires family members to be informed regarding post mortem examinations or inquests.<\/p><p>I wish to inform the House that, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, the Government has agreed to priority drafting of a number of further amendments, which the Minister intends to bring forward on Committee Stage.  Subject to the advice of the Attorney General these will include: providing a statutory basis for a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth where there is cause for concern, for example, arising from matters raised by the bereaved parents; permitting a coroner to seek directions from the High Court on a point of law relating to his or her functions; providing a power for the coroner to direct a hospital or other health institution to make available relevant medical records of a deceased person for the purposes of the post mortem examination; and empowering the Minister to make regulations, which will be developed together with the Minister for Health and relevant professional organisations, to guide the best conduct of a post mortem examination for coronial purposes, and the proper storage and ultimate disposal of human tissue or organs removed for the purposes of the post mortem.<\/p> <p> Many of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions build on an extensive review by the Department of Justice and Equality of the Coroners Bill 2007, which also proposed to modernise and strengthen coroners&rsquo; powers but had become, in some respects, outdated.  The 2007 Bill also provided for a major administrative restructuring of the coroner system.  Due to the major challenges then confronting public finances, this aspect of the 2007 Bill was not progressed following Second Stage in the Seanad, and now needs significant updating.  We must, however, continue to examine the optimum organisation of the coroner service.  Further elements of the existing law and structures will require significant improvement.<\/p> <p> I will now address the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard provision stating that the principal Act referred to in the Bill is the Coroners Act 1962.<\/p> <p> Section 6 of the Bill inserts into the principal Act a new Part IIA on reporting of death.  It consists of two proposed new sections.  Proposed section 16A sets out comprehensively the general types of deaths that must be reported to coroners.  It should be read in combination with the new second schedule contained at section 28 of the Bill, which sets out a list of concrete examples of mandatory reportable deaths.  This list expressly includes any maternal death or late maternal death and any death of a stillborn child, a death intra partum or an infant death.  There is a power for the Minister to amend the list of reportable deaths by statutory instrument.<\/p> <p> Proposed section 16B sets out comprehensively the various persons who are under a duty to report a mandatory reportable death to the coroner.  Reporting does not mean the death would automatically be subject to a post mortem examination or an inquest.  A doctor reporting the death to the coroner must indicate whether he or she is satisfied, in the circumstances, to certify that the death was due to natural causes.  Where no cause for concern arises, such a certificate is sufficient under the Coroners Act.  The section also updates the penalties for failing to report a reportable death.<\/p> <p> Section 7 updates section 17 of the principal Act to provide that an inquest is mandatory if the person has died in State custody or detention, and also in all cases of maternal death or late maternal death.  Section 7 also provides for the possible exception to mandatory inquest in maternal death cases, subject to a number of specified conditions.  The coroner must be satisfied that the death was a natural one and there are no matters of concern requiring inquest, after consultation with the bereaved family and taking account of four specified conditions, including the outcome of the post mortem examination, the family&rsquo;s views and whether sufficient information has been provided to the coroner regarding the death.<\/p> <p> Section 8 amends section 18 of the principal Act to provide that the coroner has discretion to inquire into the circumstances of death and if the coroner thinks proper, to hold an inquest if a medical certificate of the cause of death has been provided but the coroner considers that the certificate is not completed in a satisfactory manner.<\/p> <p> Section 9 is a significant provision, which extends the scope of the inquest to include establishing \"the circumstances in which the death occurred\".  This is a key issue in certain inquests, for example, those occurring while the deceased was in State custody or detention, and for strengthening our compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will remain the position that an inquest does not make any finding of civil or criminal liability.<\/p> <p> Section 10 requires the coroner to give at least 14 days&rsquo; notice to family members and interested persons regarding the holding of the inquest.  Section 12 modernises the current provision for identifying the body of the deceased person.<\/p> <p> Section 13 of the Bill amends section 30 of the principal Act, to delete the restriction that an inquest shall be \"confined to ascertaining the identity of the [deceased] person ... and how, when, and where the death occurred&rdquo;.  This change flows from the new provision at section 9, widening the scope of the inquest.<\/p> <p> Section 14 amends section 31 of the principal Act to include reference to the findings made at inquest, in that section&rsquo;s prohibition of censure.  Section 16 replaces sections 19 and 52, and amends section 33, of the principal Act concerning post mortem examinations directed by the coroner.  It introduces four new sections, 33A to 33D, providing for: a modern process for directing the post mortem examination; a requirement for information about the post mortem examination to be given to a family member; a more detailed statutory framework where there is a mandatory post mortem examination; the making and reporting of a post mortem examination by a pathologist; and a new power for the coroner to direct a further post mortem examination of the body of the deceased, if the coroner thinks necessary.<\/p> <p> Section 17 amends section 37 of the principal Act to provide that if a witness fails to attend the inquest without reasonable excuse, the coroner can seek a High Court order directing the witness to attend.<\/p> <p> Section 18 amends section 38 of the principal Act.  It will empower a coroner to direct a witness to reply on oath or affirmation, or to answer a question, and to direct a person to produce to the inquest documents or objects in that person&rsquo;s possession or control.  It also allows the coroner to seek a High Court order that a person comply with the coroner&rsquo;s direction.<\/p><p> Section 20 amends section 40 of the principal Act to remove the requirement that the coroner must sit with a jury in every road traffic death case.  This change has long been sought by coroners.  Currently, the jury requirement even applies in straightforward cases where no other vehicle is involved.  Coroners advise that it is increasingly difficult to empanel juries for such a large volume of cases.  The coroner would instead keep the discretion to empanel a jury in any road traffic case, where appropriate.<\/p> <p> Section 22 provides a significant new power for the coroner, acting under a warrant from the District Court, to enter and inspect premises and to take copies or possession of any document or material relevant to the inquest.<\/p> <p> Section 23 is a new provision whereby the coroner may obtain advice and assistance from an expert, if he or she considers it necessary, on a particularly specialised subject relative to the death.<\/p> <p> Section 26 extends the scheme of legal aid in the principal Act for a family member of the deceased at inquest, introduced in 2013 for certain categories of deaths, to cases of maternal death or late maternal death.<\/p> <p> Section 27 inserts a new provision whereby if a body corporate commits an offence under the Coroners Act, its officers may also be personally liable if they consented or connived in its commission.<\/p> <p> Section 28 provides for the new Second Schedule, which sets out for the first time in statutory form a specific and detailed list of concrete examples of deaths that must be reported to a coroner.<\/p> <p> The proposed changes to the law in the reporting of deaths will ensure clarity for responsible persons, including hospital authorities, and will support the development of transparent and accountable oversight for checking and investigating certain types of death.  Most importantly, they will support timely and transparent provision of information by health and other authorities to bereaved families.  The Minister hopes that, with the co-operation of all sides, we can facilitate the Bill's swift passage.  I commend the Bill to the House and thank the Acting Chairman for the extra time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900052#EEE00200","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537379700,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I allowed the Minister of State to run over for a few minutes.

I also mentioned how the trust that women placed in our health system had been let down.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill, which strengthens and modernises the law governing coroners' inquests.  I pay tribute to Deputy Clare Daly, who proposed a set of changes in 2015.  Her proposal was prompted by inquests into maternal deaths between 2007 and 2013 that returned verdicts of medical misadventure.<\/p>  <p>  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, supports the requirement that a maternal death automatically be the subject of an inquest.  The Bill will allow a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth where there is cause for concern, for instance, raised by the bereaved parents.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2011 and 2013, there were 27 recorded maternal deaths.  That is almost 14 per year.  It is a high number.  Of these, only three were the subject of an inquest.  I have reason for being close to this matter, as one of those three involved a friend who was married to another friend of mine.  She was Nora Hyland.  I remember her death in February 2012 well.  Many times afterwards, I sat with her bereaved husband and her motherless son, a very small baby who had been born approximately two hours before Nora passed away.  I remember trying to understand the grief, the trauma and the many unanswered questions as to why this lovely woman had died.  The other two cases that were eventually granted inquests were those of Savita Halappanavar and Sally Rowlette.<\/p>  <p>  I will mention one other woman, Dhara Kivlehan, who suffered complications in Sligo and was referred to Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, where she died.  I mention her specifically because I spoke to Stephen Hyland an hour ago about the difficulties he went through at the time.  When I was first elected to the D&aacute;il two and a half years ago, he texted me to say \"Well done\" and that he might need to contact me about an automatic right to an inquest after a maternal death.  This debate was effectively arranged at the last minute, so I rang him to say that I would now have the opportunity to repay our friendship and discuss the situation.  He told me that lives could have been saved had there been an automatic inquest.  Sadly, Dhara died after being referred to Sligo and then brought to Ulster.  Her family had to fight and fight to get an inquest.  During that fight, another woman died, Sally Rowlette, who had also been referred to Sligo.  After both inquests were concluded, it turned out that both women had died of the exact same syndrome.  Had an inquest been held into Dhara's death, the hospital would have known what to watch out for and Sally's life could more than likely have been saved.  The doctors would have recognised the symptoms.<\/p>  <p>  Here we are five years later.  The proposed changes should have happened before now, but at least they are being made now.  Other changes also need to be made, but we need to move on this and discuss the good elements proposed in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill addresses a key problem, one that the Minister mentioned, that continues to cause great public unease.  In a number of high-profile cases, and some not-so-high-profile cases, of maternal and perinatal deaths, deaths occurring in hospitals that should have been reported to coroners because they raised issues of medical error and were unnatural deaths under the Coroners Act 1962 were not actually reported.  This has certainly led to inconsistencies in the way in which maternal deaths have been recorded in official statistics.  A strengthening and modernising of the current law will allow lessons to be learned to prevent the recurrence of errors and such deaths.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will allow a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth where there is cause for concern raised in particular by the bereaved parents.  We must remember that these are incredibly sensitive and private matters for traumatised mothers, husbands, partners and families and need to be dealt with in the most sensitive, but professional, manner.<\/p><p>They should not have to fight to obtain basic information at a time when they are at their most vulnerable.  Families have wasted years fighting for inquests into the deaths of their loved ones.  The fact that it has, in the past, proved difficult to persuade a coroner to hold inquests into maternal deaths has resulted in a lack of transparency about the incidence and causes of maternal deaths.  This prevents lessons from being learned which could prevent the recurrence of errors.  The inconsistency with which maternal deaths have been recorded has led to significant under-reporting of these incidences.  I was quite shocked when I learned of 27 maternal deaths within two years. <\/p> <p>Decisions of the European Court of Human Rights have stressed the obligation of states to investigate unexplained deaths or those that occur in circumstances that involved official persons or authorities.  The court has explicitly pointed out that the State's obligation can extend to deaths than occur in hospitals, to be able to establish the cause of death and any liability on the part of health professionals.  It is clear that this legislation is required to ensure Ireland is compliant with the European Court of Human Rights.  On a broader note, bereaved families and coroners have experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining basic information which should have been provided to them.  They should not have to fight to get this information.  The increased powers afforded to coroners by this Bill is welcomed.  My party will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to help strengthen these provisions.  A complete reorganisation of coroner services under a national coroner services body, as envisaged by two previous Bills, including a Government Bill in 2007 and Deputy Clare Daly's Private Members' Bill in 2015, is not provided for in this Bill.  This Bill did not go through pre-legislative scrutiny and so it is not clear what the Government's rationale is for limiting the extent of the overhaul.  We want to know why.  Once the Government has outlined the reason for this, we will consider the merits of that decision or decide not to support that and to bring in our own amendments on it.<\/p> <p> It is important to look at the most significant and important provisions.  The first is to provide for new categories of deaths that must be reported to a coroner, including maternal deaths and late maternal deaths.  The definition of late maternal death is the death of a woman more than 42 days but less than 265 days after the end of her pregnancy.  Other new categories include stillbirths, deaths of infants during birth or in the first year of their lives, deaths by suicide, deaths by drug reactions or overdoses and deaths that may be due to healthcare-acquired infections.<\/p> <p> The Bill allows inquests to examine the circumstances surrounding a death and not just the cause of death as is currently the case.  This will not entail the coroner considering questions of civil or criminal liability but the coroner will be concerned with establishing the circumstances of the death as distinct from making findings in respect of it.<\/p> <p> The Bill enhances the powers of the coroner to procure post mortem examinations; to obtain documentary and other evidence; to summon witnesses; to apply for search warrants; to take evidence from a witness who is likely to be outside the State at the time of an inquest at any time before the inquest; and to obtain expert advice or assistance.<\/p> <p> The Bill introduces new offences for failing to abide by requests of the coroner.  Failure to answer a question at an inquest is an offence and there will be a new offence of giving false or misleading evidence to an inquest.<\/p> <p> There will be improvements for families of deceased persons, including for families of deceased persons to be kept informed about the work being undertaken by a coroner.  Communication is vital for families that are going through grief.  I mentioned the Scally report earlier.  A doctor's response to a woman when she asked when she would know was that she would see it on the news headlines or television.  We do not want that here.  The Bill provides for civil legal aid to be provided for families of deceased persons.  I acknowledge that the Minister indicated that he will, subject to advice from the Attorney General, seek to put forward amendments on Committee Stage to authorise coroners to inquire into stillbirths where there is cause of concern; to allow a coroner to seek directions from the High Court on a point of law in relation to the performance of their function; to provide for coroners to direct a hospital to make available the medical records of deceased persons; and to provide for the Minister to make regulations on the proper storage and disposal of any material removed during post mortem examination.<\/p> <p> When the Minister of State spoke earlier, she mentioned the public unease that all of these very sad cases brought about.  She was right in that because there was huge public unease.  We have to remember the private grief, trauma and sorrow of lost daughters, sisters, wives, partners, mothers and friends.  I would love to stand here and say that we will never have a maternal death again.  Of course we will but we have to ensure that when there is a maternal death, all the supports needed for the mother's family will be met and there will be a post mortem examination into the death and all the circumstances surrounding it.  I commend this Bill and I again commend Deputy Clare Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900054#GGG00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537380300,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I join with Deputy O'Loughlin in thanking Deputy Clare Daly, who I know had her own Bill covering mandatory inquests for maternal deaths.  I believe in many ways that her work has forced this onto the Government's agenda.  I hope that Deputy Clare Daly is happy with this legislation and that the families who have suffered with regard to maternal death are happy with it too.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe it is incredibly important that the remit of inquests is extended to look beyond the medical cause and into the circumstances leading to the death.  Issues relating to deaths can be tragic and it is vital that a coroner can look at these matters holistically if the situation necessitates it.  I am glad that this Bill will eventually extend the powers of the coroner when requesting witnesses and evidence and allow for questioning if required.  I feel that the powers this Bill gives to the coroners are proportionate to the job they have to do, especially in cases where a thorough investigation is needed, such as in the case of a violent death or medical misadventure.  In such cases, as we have seen many times before, such as in the cases of maternal deaths and others, coroners' powers have proven to be ineffective in investigations.  This Bill seeks to gives the coroner powers of warrant, of search and seizure of documents, and also penalises those who refuse to co-operate with inquests.  I am glad to see that mandatory reporting to the coroner will be extended where cause of death is unknown and if deaths are somewhat suspicious or unnatural, such as where a death has occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or by unfair means, by misadventure, or in other areas.<\/p>  <p>  As stated at the outset, this Bill responds to Deputy Daly's Bill introducing mandatory inquests in all cases of maternal death or late maternal deaths, and extends legal aid to family members of the deceased.  As it currently stands, maternal deaths are treated as deaths which must as a rule or practice be reported to the coroner.  However, inquests are not automatically granted in these cases.  Between 2007 and 2013, eight inquests were held following maternal deaths.<\/p><p>All eight cases resulted in rulings of medical misadventure.  It is the duty of the State to investigate deaths that take place in suspicious circumstances or in circumstances that leave them open to question.  Too many families in this State have been left facing the wall of bureaucracy on their own without any supports.  However, if we are to correct the situation and ensure there are mandatory inquests, then we must also address the failures which lead to the need for inquests.  For instance, Ireland has the lowest number of consultant obstetricians per 100,000 women in the OECD.  That is one consultant obstetrician for every 597 births per annum.  To illustrate how poor the service we provide to women is, the comparable rate in Scotland is one obstetrician for every 268 births.<\/p> <p> The shortcomings in maternity services are numerous and have directly led to heart-rending incidents involving mothers and children, including in some cases tragic death.  As legislators, we must acknowledge that while it is right to ensure there are mandatory inquests in the event of maternal deaths, we must also act on the national maternity strategy and other relevant measures.  The national maternity strategy has no statutory underpinning and huge swathes of it have not been implemented.  We must also address the issues while ensuring there are mandatory maternal death inquests.  However, it is unfortunate that the Bill does not appear to facilitate what has become known as Jake&rsquo;s amendment.  That would bring about a change in coroner legislation that my colleague Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn has been advocating for many years.  In 2013, 14 year old Jake McGill Lynch was prescribed the antidepressant, Prozac.  He ended his life using a firearm.  Jake was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, and was given the antidepressant drug despite research stating that the drug has no benefit for children with Asperger's and despite the emerging evidence of harm.  The coroner in Jake's case rejected a suicide verdict.  That was due to an email that Jake wrote 24 hours before he took his own life.  When writing to a friend he conveyed his concerns about the medication he was taking, and said that he was feeling worse because of it.  The Bill Senator Mac Lochlainn introduced some years ago proposed to amend the Coroners Act in order that it would be possible to return a verdict of iatrogenic suicide, which is essentially suicide brought on by side effects of prescribed medication.  Despite many assurances to Jake's family from Ministers for Justice and Equality, the Bill does not cater for the measures they wish to see included.  Sinn F&eacute;in will submit an amendment on Committee Stage to introduce the measure.<\/p> <p> That will not be the only way in which we will seek to strengthen this legislation.  I am sure many will agree with us that we should include a provision to provide a statutory basis for a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth where there is cause for concern, for example, arising from matters raised by the bereaved parents.  We also believe it is essential that this legislation provides for the Minister to make regulations on the proper storage and disposal of any material removed for the purposes of a post-mortem examination, including return to a family member for disposal where requested and appropriate, and to provide power for the coroner to direct a hospital or other health institution to make medical records of the deceased person available for the purposes of a post-mortem examination.  Those are just a number of areas in which we will seek to be constructive and to strengthen the legislation.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to look at an issue before Committee Stage to see if there is scope for it in this Bill.  While it might be the case there is not, we wish to have the issue examined.  I refer to a situation whereby the family of missing persons would be allowed to deal with any immediate financial issues for missing persons, and to allow a family to apply for a declaration of presumed death to a coroner or the Circuit Court.  That is a very sensitive issue.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, introduced a Bill in the D&aacute;il entitled the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill.  The Bill aims to provide for the effects in civil law of persons who are missing, including arrangements for interim management of a missing person's property, and to provide for the civil status of a missing person where the circumstances of his or her absence leads to a presumption of death.  I may correspond with the Minister in writing on the issue to ascertain if it will be possible for such a measure to be included in the Bill.<\/p> <p> Overall, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the aims and objectives of the Bill.  I again thank the many Deputies who in one way or another have been raising issues concerning inquests into deaths in the State for many years.  This legislation is the result of their tireless pursuit of justice on behalf of many bereaved families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900055#HHH00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537380900,"counter":490,"content":"<p>It is absolutely incredible in some ways that we are dealing with a situation where the coronial service is operating under legislation dating back to the 1960s and in spite of the considerable changes that have taken place in society since then, we have not been able to get our act together to modernise the legislation.  I am aware that secondary legislation behind the scenes did change the situation somewhat.  I had the privilege of attending a coroners' conference two years ago.  I know the good work they do, how under-resourced they are and how they have striven might and main to demand of this House that legislation be changed to allow them to do a job they could do in the public good.  In that sense it is tremendous in some ways, while shocking in others that we are operating against that backdrop, but at least we are here now with the first legislation that I hope will be enacted by the House to update the situation somewhat.<\/p>  <p>  I will not go very deeply into the details of the legislation.  The Minister has done that and other speakers have also done so.  However, the provisions in the Bill do arm coroners more and give them more power, which is to be welcomed.  I reiterate the point made by the Minister that we have been in discussions about the amendments that, unfortunately, did not make it into the original draft of the Bill, but there has been a commitment by the Minister and the Department to ensure that when we reach Committee Stage, some important amendments will be included.  I assure people in the Gallery that we have gone over those amendments that will be included in the later Stages with a fine-tooth comb and, by and large, we are very happy with them.  I thank Brendan McNamara and Madeleine Reid in particular.  This House is very good at criticising the Department of Justice and Equality in particular, which comes in for a justifiable kicking a lot of the time, but it is also very important to recognise the good work done.  Any delays to the Bill were not as a result of the staff at the coalface.<\/p>  <p>  Neither were the delays due to the Ministers either, given that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, said it is a priority for him and it was most definitely a priority for the previous Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who elevated the Bill as a key project item for the Department.  One could ask what that says about society that in spite of not one but two Ministers prioritising this important area, it has been an almighty uphill battle to get where we are today and to get a recognition, which was not there in 2015 when we introduced the legislation.  That was despite the fact that the Government of the day largely welcomed the Bill but it had reservations about many clauses in terms of mandatory inquests in cases of maternal death which are now being incorporated in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  While that is great on one level, it is a tragedy that it has taken so long for us to get here.  We must be honest.  The only reason it is here is because of the heroic struggle led by the people in the Gallery in support of the victims of the lack of mandatory inquests, namely, the people who have been at the coalface, whose human tragedies have been turned into a movement to try to change the law for the betterment of others.  It is quite incredible to meet the families of the women who died in maternity hospitals.  I will mention them all later.  I refer to people like Sean Rowlette who lost his partner in childbirth and came home to three children, including a new baby, who had to run a farm and who probably never did a household chore in his life before.  He had to deal with all that, raise his children on his own and he still had the courage and the decent humanity and empathy to turn his grief into something constructive in order that no other family would have to do that.  That is what people like the partners of many of the women who died, the midwives and the foot soldiers in the Elephant Collective have done to get us here.  I have no doubt but that this would not have happened without their efforts.<\/p><p>That is a recognition of them but it is also a shocking indictment of our system.<br\/><br\/>We have a problem with women in this country: the women are not the problem but, rather, the healthcare that is given to them before, during and after they give birth.  Our health system has infected women with hepatitis C, taken hacksaws to their pelvises, unnecessarily removed their wombs and refused them abortions in the most unspeakable circumstances.  The pain of women affected by the recent vaginal mesh scandal was dismissed as being in their minds.  Women went to doctors and reported their appalling pain and problems but not a single doctor reported that to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which continues to prescribe vaginal mesh for the treatment of women.  Women have been refused treatment and treated as incubators even while their families begged the State to let them go.  The State has threatened to imprison women who did not want to undergo an unwanted caesarean section.  It has insulted women and ignored them when they tried to speak up.  It has left them traumatised and reeling.  After all that is done, the State inevitably gears up for another go at women, dragging them and their families through the courts.  That is the backdrop to this issue.<br\/><br\/>This is particularly shocking in the case of maternal deaths because it involves healthy women who entered our hospitals with the justified expectation that their experiences in hospital would not leave them psychologically or physically scarred.  They justifiably considered it almost unimaginable that they would die in hospital.  They held the justified expectation that, should something go wrong, they and their families would be dealt with honestly, openly, respectfully and transparently.  How often is that expectation fulfilled in our health system?  It gives me no comfort to say that it is rarely lived up to.  It took the victims of the hepatitis C scandal years to have their issues addressed.  The victims of symphysiotomy are still fighting for justice in the latter years of their lives.<br\/><br\/>Women have walked into our maternity hospitals and walked out days later with post-traumatic stress disorder.  According to Nurture, a charity which supports women, thousands of women experience post-traumatic stress every year following treatment in our health service.  We are told that the Coombe and Holles Street hospitals are not war zones, although some of the midwives in the Public Gallery may disagree with that.  However, if they are not war zones, what causes the post-traumatic stress suffered by pregnant women in our hospitals?  Among the 15 problems identified in that regard are impersonal treatment, problems with hospital staff, not being listened to and a lack of information or explanation.  Dismissing, ignoring or denying information to patients has real lifelong consequences for them.  It is not minor but, rather, a frightening mark of the paternalism that still infests our maternity services that we are so far behind the curve in terms of being honest with women about what is happening to them and why.<br\/><br\/>Families whose healthy babies suffered catastrophic birth injuries leading to lifelong disabilities have had to fight for a decade or more to get resources for their children.  It has taken ten or 15 years for the HSE finally to cough up.  A sample of 30 baby deaths due to negligence in Irish hospitals between 2008 and 2016 was compiled.  In each of the cases in which an apology or settlement was recorded, it was received three to nine years after the baby died and many of the cases involved no admission of liability.  Why are innocent people subjected to this abject cruelty?  Why is it happening?  We can re-examine such issues but part of this discussion should be about looking forward.  What causes those delays and hesitancies?  Is it to keep insurance companies happy or premiums down?  Is it institutional inertia?  Is that why our hospitals subject people to what in some ways constitutes arbitrary torture?  All of the international evidence indicates that if doctors and healthcare staff are open and honest with patients when something goes wrong, the patients are far less likely to sue.  It suggests that many of those who sue do so to get answers rather than redress.  I make that point because it is very relevant to inquests and getting information.<br\/><br\/>Exactly one year ago, Deputy Wallace and I sat down with senior officials of the HSE to discuss mandatory open disclosure.  The officials were totally against it.  The only reason we were given a meeting with them was that some of our amendments to the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 were unexpectedly accepted and called for mandatory open disclosure.  Suddenly, the officials wished to meet us to tell us it was a bad idea, without offering any supporting information for that view, and to persuade us to reverse the amendments.  Now, of course, mandatory open disclosure is the order of the day because of the CervicalCheck scandal.  Everybody wants it, including those who voted it down last year when we had the chance to provide for it in legislation.  It is a sad indictment of this House that victims could have obtained answers in the past 18 months if we had enshrined it in legislation at that stage.<br\/><br\/>This Bill is very much aligned with the push for open disclosure because we need a health system that works for women and their families and does not compound their suffering by denying, defending or covering up in the face of tragedy.  That is why we need mandatory inquests and mandatory open disclosure.  We need pre-action protocols to get the lawyers out of our hospitals.  That is not news.  A recent editorial in the <i>Irish Medical Journal<\/i>stated that in many hospitals the medico-risk management department is larger and better staffed than the library.  There is something deeply wrong with a system that spends more on damages and legal fees than on funding our maternity services.  This Bill should be part of a suite of measures to address that.  There is often discussion of a litigious culture in this State.  Is it any wonder that people are forced to take recourse to the law when they do not get answers?  This Bill is a start in addressing that issue.  It has been a long road to get to this point but the Bill will move things onward.<br\/><br\/>I became involved in the issue of maternal deaths more than seven years ago, in May 2011, when I was contacted by AIMS Ireland, which sought help in raising parliamentary questions as to why there had not been a full inquiry into the tragic death of Bimbo Onanuga in the Rotunda Hospital in March 2010.  We have stayed in touch with the warriors who are present in the Public Gallery since we first tabled questions on that case.  We did what we could to support them in the effort to get an inquest for Bimbo.  On 12 December 2012 the coroner finally agreed to hold an inquest.  In November 2013, after four long days of hearings spread over eight months, he recorded a verdict of medical misadventure in Bimbo's death.  I attended the inquest, which was shocking and devastating in equal measure.  What is more shocking is the fact that before her inquest took place six women lost their lives in our maternity services in the autumn of 2012.  There were inquests into only two of those deaths.  In the autumn of 2014 three further inquests were held, each of which returned a verdict of medical misadventure.<br\/><br\/>The onus was on all of us to do everything we could to prevent more tragedies and step up the fight in honour of the women who died and their families, so we introduced the Bill in 2015.  It has been a long road since then.  Between 2007 and 2014 the families of Tania McCabe, Evelyn Flanagan, Jennifer Crean, Bimbo Onanuga, Dhara Khivlehan, Nora Hyland, Savita Halappanavar, Sally Rowlette, not satisfied with the partial explanations offered to them by the HSE, had to fight tooth and nail for inquests.  They needed to know why healthy women who attended early and appropriately for ante-natal care and were fully in the care of our system died.  They needed to know that for all of the reasons earlier pointed out by Deputy Fiona McLoughlin and in order to learn lessons and prevent it happening to other women.  That is the step we must reach.  Two or three maternal deaths occur in all categories in Ireland each year.  We need to know in full what happened and what lies behind the deaths.  We cannot rely on confidential or internal inquiries and so on because hospitals and the HSE hide the truth behind them.  It is timely and relevant that we are having this discussion on the back of the earlier statements on the Scally report.  We need public inquests for the families involved in these awful tragedies in order to enforce genuine accountability for the terrible failures in the known cases but also in all the cases where an inquest should have been held but was not.<\/p><p> The pain does not go away for people.  Only last week, I happened to meet a Polish man, who has lived in Ireland for many years, whose wife died in childbirth in 2011.  That man's family, story and name has not appeared in any statistic or book, and I will not reveal them here tonight, but his pain is as fresh today as it was seven years ago.  He still has not got answers.  Because of what happened during the traumatised birth of the child, the child was also damaged at birth.  He has been raising that child alone for the past seven years.  He has not got any answers since the time he was sedated in the chamber as he begged the staff to save his wife's life, only for it to be too late.<\/p> <p> There are cases where people never got the answers.  I want to put on the record the names of the partners of the women who championed this issue but I do so in the spirit that there are names of women, their partners, their families and their children who have not made it onto the D&aacute;il record who never got an answer.  I mention the names of those we do know out of respect also for those we do not know.  They are Sean Rowlette, Michael Kivlehan, Abiola Adesina, Aidan McCabe, Stephen Hyland, Francis Crean, Padraic Flanagan, Praveen Halappanavar and Alan Thawley.  Let us be clear.  Since we introduced this legislation the first time, Malak Thawley has sadly died an unnecessary death that had to be dragged out through litigation by her partner, Alan, yet it happened again.  The reason people sacrificed their time and energies and laid bear their most personal tragedies was to ensure it would not happen again.  That is the reason we are here.<\/p> <p> People want to thank me but there is no need.  I am an office, a brand.  The brains behind my office are the ones who did the work, namely, Aideen O'Sullivan, who is in the Gallery, and also Liz Cassin and Ronan McCourt in my office, who regularly fight this battle and liaise with all the people we have had the honour to campaign with.  There is no need to thank us.  That is our job.<\/p> <p> However, the people in the Elephant Collective have been tireless campaigners in the run-up to this Bill.  They travelled the country with their \"Picking Up the Threads: Remaking the Fabric of Care\" exhibition.  They have written letters, postcards and press statements and they have talked to local councils.  We have the privilege of knowing that many local councils the length and breadth of this country, with members of all parties and none, have supported their call for mandatory inquests in cases of maternal deaths.  Those in the Elephant Collective are the most amazing group who have ever come together.  Their work on this campaign, and their doggedness, tirelessness and kindness have been incredible.  It is a lesson in terms of the type of approach we should have in our health service: that of caring, collective empathy and human understanding.<\/p> <p> Everybody makes mistakes.  The best health service in the world will make mistakes.  Women will go into hospital healthy and happy and they will die in childbirth this year.  Sadly, that is a fact of life, but we can minimise those cases if we learn the lessons, and mandatory inquests are part of that.  To that end, this legislation will be a testament to Jo Murphy-Lawless, who is retiring tomorrow - that is why she is making me cry - having given a lifelong service to women, and pregnant women in particular, and to student midwives.  Trinity College Dublin has been so lucky to have the brains, the passion and the commitment of this tiny woman who is an absolute giant.  The fact she is retiring from this active phase of her life with Trinity College and going on to bigger and better things is an incredibly fitting testament to her that we are here tonight.  We owe it to her to ensure that we try to get all Stages of the legislation passed and enacted before Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537382100,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The next slot is the Rural Independents.

I support that going forward.  <\/p>  <p>  The death of a loved one can be a deeply distressing time.  It has been brought to my attention that when an Irish person dies abroad, his or her death cannot be registered in Ireland.  That is heartbreaking for the families and loved ones of the deceased, and I sympathise with any family left in that position.  That is such a difficult time for the family, and we need to consider ways of supporting bereaved families and allowing for these deaths to be registered in Ireland.  According to my information, registration of the deaths of Irish people who have died abroad is short of being resolved and has cross-party support.  Why has this not happened?  This is an urgent issue that needs to be looked into.<\/p>  <p>  When a person passes away in Ireland, this Bill retains discretion for the coroner, having consulted family members of the deceased, to hold an inquest into the death.  If the coroner is satisfied, taking account of the specified matters, including the views of the family members, that the death was natural, an inquest will not be needed.<\/p>  <p>  In the cases where an inquest is required, it should be carried out in a timely and efficient manner.  Having spoken to some of my constituents who have relayed their experiences to me, I know these families can have problems receiving farm payments, etc. if the farm is in the bereaved's name until the inquest is completed.  It is important, therefore, that strong supports are put in place for such families.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill further provides for mandatory reporting to a coroner of a stillbirth death or an infant death.  I have 100% sympathy for any parent who loses a child and the Bill should not place an additional burden on grieving parents at such a difficult time.  I ask that this part of the legislation be examined and implemented in a way that will not cause further distress to grief-stricken parents.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the Bill will make provision for information to be provided to a family member of the decreased.  It is important that families of the decreased be kept informed during this difficult time.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome also that the Bill will widen the scope of an inquest from investigating the proximate medical cause of death to establishing the circumstances in which the decreased died.  It will provide new powers for a coroner to enter a premises with a warrant to inspect a copy or seize documents required for a coroner's inquiry into the death of a person and it will direct a witness to answer questions at an inquest.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, I support the amendments in the Bill but stress that they need to take into account the difficulties of the families, the loved ones and the bereaved.  These amendments should help to support people who have been bereaved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900058#LLL00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1537382100,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Mandatory reporting and having automatic inquests on all maternal deaths should be enshrined in law.  Very shortly following my election to this House, I met a lady in Ennis, Ms Martina Hynan, who brought to my attention that all maternal deaths did not require a mandatory inquest.  I was quite shocked to hear that.  I worked as a junior doctor in the Coombe hospital and if a maternal death occurred in that hospital it was taken seriously by the medical and nursing personnel, who viewed it as a failure on their part that somebody would die in the maternity services.  I understood the internal inquiries led to inquests at a later date.  I was quite shocked to find that was not the case.<\/p>  <p>  Martina Hynan is an artist who is part of the Elephant Collective, which is a multimedia expedition that travels around Ireland.  It commemorates the deaths of those who died in our maternity services and tries to heighten awareness of those deaths.  I was impressed by her.  I also saw Anne Marie Green's documentary, \"Picking Up the Threads: Remaking the Fabric of Care\", again highlighting the issue of those who die in our maternity services or shortly after their deliveries.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill mentions indirect maternal deaths, direct maternal deaths and late maternal; it covers all aspects of care.  It is shocking that, in 2018, we not have automatic mandatory reporting.  Those ladies, and men, who have campaigned tirelessly for this legislation visited county councils throughout the country.<\/p><p>Deputy Clare Daly has mentioned many councils - Clare, Sligo, Donegal, Wexford and probably many others - that have endorsed the campaign to have mandatory inquests on all maternal deaths.  I know Deputy Daly does not want to be thanked but we Rural Independents Deputies generally end up speaking after her and we do want to thank her for all the work she has done in this regard and in many other campaigns.  It is very important that this aspect of the Coroners (Amendment) Bill is taken seriously.  If amendments need to be made to it, they should be made.  It is absolutely essential that women get proper care but also that the families of those women who died, their husbands, parents and the children who were left behind, get answers on what the circumstances were in respect of their deaths.  That does not in any way imply that there was any negligence in those deaths but it is very important that they are properly investigated so that those in caring roles can learn from what happened to prevent it from happening in the future.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House and hope it makes a rapid passage through the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900058#LLL00400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537382700,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this very important Bill and also to thank Deputy Clare Daly for her input and her long-standing work on this matter.  The coroner services, which are operated by the local authorities, are in many instances the final verification of what happen to a family's loved one and on all occasions it is a very sad time for families.  So many families have to endure and wait for this inquest which in some cases takes a very long time.  I would ask that going forward these inquests be expedited.  If they go on for a long time while families are getting back and starting to live without their loved one, the inquest brings it all back again maybe two or three years later.  That is not good enough; inquests should happen a lot sooner.<\/p>  <p>  The key provisions of the Bill include clarifying that the purpose of the inquest goes beyond establishing the medical cause of the death and establishing the circumstances in which the death took place.  In the case of farm accidents or road accidents, it is very final and very sad to know how the person died medically, but it is very important to determine what caused the accident so that we could eliminate that cause or prevent a case like it ever happening again.  Another key provision is strengthening the coroner's powers to summon witnesses to an inquest and to direct a witness to produce documents and evidence and to answer questions.  I think that is only fair because, again, families are waiting for the truth and that is very important.  In some cases, witnesses may be after travelling from very far away.  When the inquest takes place they have to travel a very long distance and maybe they do not have finances.  Things like that have to be taken into account and it should be possible to try to help or finance someone who is having a difficulty coming to the inquest.<\/p>  <p>  Another key provision is new powers for the coroner acting under a warrant from the District Court to enter and inspect premises and to take copies or possession of documents or material relevant to the inquest.  That is very important because otherwise cases and the truth will not be made available.  There will be appropriate penalties for witnesses not co-operating with the inquest and I believe that is very important also.  <\/p>  <p>  At this juncture, I would like to thank our own coroner in Kerry, Terence Casey, who retired last year after giving more than 20 years' service to south Kerry.  He did a wonderful job in tough conditions.  It is always tough when we go through the real aspects of what happened.  We need good people to be able to withstand what they see.  We are also very lucky, in respect of farm accidents and road accidents, that we have Inspector Jim O'Brien, who operates out of Tralee and is doing a tough job brilliantly.  He has vast experience and is most helpful.  We respect him for his expertise and his honesty and the great work that he is doing.<\/p>  <p>  There is greater clarity and transparency in the mandatory reporting of certain types of death including a detailed list of specific examples of mandatory reportable deaths.  I hope that suicide is not going to be one of these mandatory reportable deaths.  Suicide is such a tragic death when it happens in a family and I do not think the general public needs to know what happened in those instances, that it was suicide.  Families are going through enough and are trying to retain their dignity.  I think it would be very unfair on these people if it had to come out publicly that their loved one's death was caused by suicide.<\/p>  <p>  It will be an offence for a responsible person not to report a mandatory reportable death to the coroner.  That is very important.  There is to be updating and modernising of the provisions regarding post mortem examinations to take account of forensic developments and current practice.  That is very important as well because as technology has improved we need to make provisions for it.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting on the provision of Deputy Clare Daly's Private Members' Bill regarding maternal deaths, I think that is most important and should have been there before but at least we hope it is to be in place going forward.  When a couple loses a baby before it is born, in mid-birth or whatever, that should not be public knowledge to anyone beyond the family.  It is very tough on a couple who may be trying to have a child and loses it before it comes into the world.<\/p>  <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak and I support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900059#MMM00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1537382700,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le Teachta Clare Daly.  I thank Deputy Daly, although she said she did not want any thanks, and her team and the other people she mentioned as well.  It is not only this piece of legislation; Deputy Daly has championed many a piece of legislation since coming in here.  I worked on one or two of them.  We can differ on many issues but she is tenacious and she will fight the battle to have these very sensitive and delicate issues sorted out.  I want to support her on that.<\/p>  <p>  The principal changes proposed in the Bill include new categories of deaths that must be reported to a coroner.<\/p><p>These include maternal deaths and the deaths of children during birth or in the year afterwards.  It is such a sensitive, delicate and emotional time.  One can never understand such a tragic loss unless one is involved.  We cannot walk in those people's shoes so it is timely that we make necessary changes in a sensitive manner.<\/p> <p> It concerns deaths of children during birth or in the year afterwards subject to limited exceptions.  These exceptions are very important.  The powers of the coroner to investigate not just the approximate cause of death but also the surrounding circumstances are very important.  I salute coroners for the job they do, which is not an easy one.  I also salute jurors who turn up.  Normally the same people turn up.  However, I have issues and campaigned in the last D&aacute;il with some siblings whose loved ones died, mainly by suicide.  In respect of the media having to be present, I know it is public and transparent but I appeal to the media not to report the minutiae where the circumstances are harrowing.  I salute Trudy Lawlor, a renowned singer from County Laois who lost her brother to suicide, who has championed this cause and who has done so much work to make inquests user-friendly because they are not user-friendly.  This Bill and others do not address it, which is a pity, but we might be able to introduce some amendments.  First, the inquest should not be held in an adversarial courtroom, which courtrooms normally are.  A courtroom is a cold place that intimidates people.  Anyone going into a court, be they a juror or observer or, worse, on a charge, is intimidated.  We tried very hard with the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, to move inquests to a different location such as a hotel or some other place with a soft ambience away from that adversarial environment with lawyers where other cases are taking place.  It is not a suitable venue.  We must be sensitive to the families who have been traumatised enough and as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, might have waited for the inquest for six, 12 or 18 months.  It must be removed from that cold and archaic system.  I am not saying we should lock the press out but the press has strict guidelines because there is no need at times to report some of the gory details of a sad and tragic accident or, worse, a self-inflicted death.  It must be changed.<\/p> <p> There will be increased powers for the coroner to procure post mortem examinations and to obtain documentary and other evidence.  This is vital and long overdue.  Sadly, there have been cases that have never been solved because of a lack of powers for the coroner.  This must be done.  There is provision for families of deceased persons to be informed of decisions relating to examinations and inquests and for civil legal aid to be provided.  Of course, they must receive civil legal aid.  It is a cold enough place.  The coroners do their best but it concerns the whole system.  The loss of a loved one is so traumatic and we need to have full disclosure.  Getting the balance between deciding what are important facts to discover, what the family must go through and what the public needs to know is a sensitive and delicate matter.  I know it must be transparent.<\/p> <p> Farm accidents and road fatalities are very difficult for families.  It is punitive if the inquest goes on for so long that insurance claims, payments or income are affected.  The spouse and children might be left without any income waiting for this.  We must always be conscious of that.  Strengthening the powers is very welcome.  Inquests must take place in the most sensitive venue and there are plenty such places.  We know that with counselling and other issues.  We have moved on a lot from the inception of the State and must ensure these sensitive issues are dealt with sensitively.  It is not a matter of skipping any laws but making it more user-friendly for those unfortunate people or families who must live with the loss and grief and also try to get the result of the inquest.  I wish the Bill well and hope there might be room for amendments to deal with the issues to which I referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900059#MMM00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537383300,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I join the other Deputies in congratulating Deputy Clare Daly, her team and the people who have been campaigning on the reporting of maternal deaths.  I commend the Deputy on that work.  I will not go into the details of it because it is not an area in which I have expertise but I hope they will not mind if I use the opportunity to raise an issue and, hopefully, raise amendments that we will present to the Minister and Department on another related area concerning the Coroner's Court in which I do have an interest and some experience that might improve the coroner's process.  This concerns fatalities from cycling accidents.  It could apply to other traffic accidents but I have a particular interest in that area.  I know we mentioned a great academic - a giant from Trinity College mentioned by Deputy Clare Daly.  My comments are very much based on the analysis of Dr. Mike McKillen from Trinity College who, on behalf of the Dublin Cycling Campaign, has been trying to attend as many coroner's hearings as possible relating to road fatalities in Dublin involving cyclists in recent years to use that avenue or mechanism to ensure that we learn the lessons of each tragedy that occurs and that we try to understand what is happening, why so many cyclist fatalities are happening and what we can do to avoid them.  In talking to Dr. McKillen, the amendments we will present will come directly from that experience in the Coroner's Court.  They are coming from a very positive and constructive attitude and approach.  The timing of this Bill is very useful for us.  I am thinking very much of Luby Maryori Ramirez.  I could name a host of other people who, unfortunately, have been involved in tragic deaths on the roads but I will mention her.  She died in March 2017 on the roundabout from Whitehall Road and Templeville Road.  Typically, so many of these incidents and cycling deaths involve an accident where a truck turns left and the cyclist is caught under the wheels.  We all know of other cases.  Several friends have died in such circumstances.  The inquest into Ms Ramirez's death happened two or three weeks ago.  It was attended by Dr. McKillen.  Arising out of that, our suggestions are very practical and specific and I hope this Bill might be a useful opportunity to provide that insight into the running of the Coroner's Court.<\/p>  <p>  These suggestions are very practical but that is what we need.  In many instances in such hearings, evidence is presented to the jury often in respect of the vehicles involved, the mechanical evidence around the nature of the vehicle, the technology or the state of the vehicle.  Based on our experience - I am talking about Dr. McKillen - that evidence is not presented in a public way.  It is not on the record and we believe it should be.  We believe that sort of evidence should be presented not just as evidence for the coroner and jury to consider but be made available publicly, which is not the case in our experience, so that the knowledge is shared and the full evidence is presented in a very public way.<\/p>  <p>  These suggestions are very technical and specific and I will return to them on Committee and Report Stages if they are ruled in order.  In respect of the evidence that is often presented in the Coroner's Court regarding traffic accidents, young garda&iacute; might report on the evidence but it is often uncertain as to what their real expertise and their training is regarding the understanding, reporting and analysis of road traffic accidents.  There is a real science around the recording, reporting and understanding of what is happening on our roads and what happens when fatal accidents or indeed any accidents occur.  Dr. McKillen's experience in attending all these hearings is that it is often very uncertain as to what experience or expertise a Garda has and a lack of understanding of the training and development of the skills of the Garda.<\/p><p>I am not blaming the garda&iacute;.  They are put in an unfortunate situation if they end up attending a coroners court where they do not have skills and expertise.  One of the recommendations we have in that regard is that the relative experience, expertise and training of the garda&iacute; in such circumstances should be shared and made clear to improve the quality of the forensic analysis, reporting and understanding of what is happening in such fatal cases.<\/p> <p> I listened with interest to the Minister of State refer in her speech to section 20 and the possibility of removing juries from dealing with some traffic fatalities where it is clear what happened, for example, a single vehicle accident.  I am slightly nervous about weakening the provisions of any analysis of road fatalities, although I fully accept the difficulties that may arise where a jury cannot be empanelled and there is a series of adjournments, which is the last thing we want the family to go through.  I accept, therefore, the need to be flexible.  We need to raise the importance and significance of, and the attention given to, the coroners court process because 160 fatalities is an intolerable number.  We should use the process to bring in people with expertise to understand how we could avoid these accidents.<\/p> <p>  In addition, we believe there is a case to be made - and we will try to draft an amendment on this - that in coroners court cases involving traffic accidents, particularly cycling accidents, although every fatality is a tragedy, there should be a provision that, for example, the National Transport Authority or another suitable authority such as a local authority should have a road engineer with expertise on hand to give evidence to the coroners court regarding what might be possible.  I will give an example to demonstrate why we call for that.  Following a tragedy on a roundabout, one might hear it said at the coroners court, \"Nothing could be done.  You can't put a cycle lane through a roundabout\", when the cycling fraternity campaign knows that it is possible.  It requires a different design perspective in terms of how our roads are designed, and that needs to be brought into coroners' reports.  In that way, the highest level expertise is available to the coroners so, if there has been an accident at a particular junction, a complete reconfiguration of the road is possible.  One needs the best experts in the court to present that evidence, so the coroner's findings and direction to the local authority has real effect.  In our experience, that is not happening under the current system, as noted in the report of Dr. McKillen to the cycling fraternity.  We are looking for a technical provision where the highest level of advanced road design engineering capability the State has is directed in such a way as to ensure it appears in any such hearings.<\/p> <p> These are technical but important provisions.  A final point is that the scheduling and information relating to coroners' hearings are often not easily available.  Dr. McKillen might only hear of a coroners court hearing if the family directly communicates to say, for example, it is coming up next week.  We would like greater public notice and provision for NGO organisations such as the Dublin Cycling Campaign or others interested in road safety, including the Road Safety Authority, to attend and contribute, and to have clear notice regarding such hearings.  They are of huge public importance, particularly to those who are involved in trying to reduce the level of road fatalities.<\/p> <p> I hope that is not inappropriate.  The Bill relates to the issue of technical and other important amendments to the coroners process.  It is correct to add some of the experience we have on how we might reduce road fatalities and improve the process of coroners reports in that regard.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900060#NNN00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537383900,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Eamon Scanlon.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, which aims to strengthen and modernise parts of the Coroners Act.  I welcome that the Bill allows for wider scope of inquiry and seeks to address public unease regarding high profile cases, including maternal deaths.  In the past, deaths relating to maternity care that should have been reported because there were issues of medical error, and were unnatural deaths, were not reported.  Bereaved families experienced difficulty obtaining basic information with which they should have been provided.  The increased powers afforded to the coroners in the legislation are welcome in this regard.  In particular, I support the requirement that maternal deaths will now be the subject of an inquest.  The introduction of mandatory reporting, post mortem examination and inquests into maternal deaths will now, hopefully, deliver the transparency, accountability and oversight that is long overdue.  Hopefully, no more families who have had loved ones lost to them will have to struggle and fight to get the answers they are entitled to.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Clare Daly and her team for pursuing this Bill, and the families who have had to suffer in the absence of these rights and powers.  The Bill will also allow a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth where there is a cause for concern, for example, if this is raised by bereaved parents.  In effect, all stillbirths, perinatal deaths and maternal deaths should now have to be reported to the coroner.  I believe this is the way it should be and it is not before time.

I knew Michael Kivlehan and his wife, and Sean and Sally Rowlette.  I remember being in the hospital that night with Sean Rowlette as his young wife, a healthy woman, was in a hospital bed on a life support machine, with him having to make the decision as to when they would turn off the machine.  Honestly, it is unbelievable to think that happened.

My officials have taken note of other questions and we will come back to the Deputies at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin, the reason we have proceeded with the reform of the coroners law in advance of reorganising the entire coroners system is to ensure the urgent changes needed on reporting deaths, including maternal deaths, and changes to the legislation on coroners' powers can be made quickly.  As I indicated earlier, the Minister is also considering optimal organisation of the coroner's service.<\/p><p>While this may take further time, we all agree that the urgent measures contained in the Bill are needed now.<\/p> <p> Deputy Clare Daly referred to the delay in bringing the Bill forward.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has acknowledged that it has taken much longer than he wished to finalise the legislation for publication.  I acknowledge that the Deputy thanked the Minister, his predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and my officials, Mr. Brendan McNamara, Ms Madeleine Reid and Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Hennessy, who accompany me in the Chamber.  Deputies Clare Daly and Fiona O'Loughlin also referred to the need for the legislation to bring about a change in communication and culture.  I agree with them that ignoring people and dismissing their concerns must change.  We must deal with patients and their families with empathy and respect.  Deputy O'Loughlin raised the Scally report.  I add my abhorrence at the treatment by some doctors, as outlined in the Scally report, of women in a disgusting, misogynist manner.  We need basic humanity in all areas in our hospitals to deal with patients and their families.<\/p> <p> Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to missing persons.  I have noted the Deputy's views on the Private Member's Bill proposed in this regard and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister.  However, I understand the proposer of that Bill has agreed, following advice, that a reference to the role of coroner is not required to achieve the Bill's objectives.  The Deputy referred also to iatrogenic suicide.  The Minister says that the introduction of a verdict of iatrogenic suicide at an inquest was proposed on Second Stage of a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Member's Bill in the Seanad on 18 October 2017.  The Government opposed the proposal and the Seanad voted not to approve the Bill.  The Government cannot accept a proposal now to introduce a verdict of iatrogenic suicide.  The position remains that the proposal, while well-intentioned, risks an inquest apportioning liability to a medical practitioner who may have prescribed the treatment or medication for the deceased person.  A coroner's inquest cannot consider questions of civil or criminal liability.  Section 30 of the Coroners Act 1962 provides against such considerations specifically.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the Private Member's Bill was legally unsound in that a new verdict would be capable of ascribing criminal liability to a person or persons who would be readily identifiable.<\/p> <p> I note in response to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's concerns that we all agree that it is desirable to reduce the delays in the holding of inquests, which can occur despite the best efforts of coroners.  The strengthening of coroners' powers and other reforms contained in the Bill should help to reduce unnecessary delays.  I have taken note of Deputy Mattie McGrath's proposal that the Coroner's Court convene at a less adversarial and more sensitive site.  We listened with interest to Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments on cycling fatalities.  One change proposed in the Bill is relevant, namely section 14, which introduces the possibility for an inquest to make general recommendations arising from a death in the interests of public health and safety.  That is all of the answers I have now but my officials can revert to anyone who wants further questions answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900061#OOO00500","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537384500,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2018: Referral to Select Committee","time":1537384500,"counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900062#PPP00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1537384500,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091900062#PPP00400","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537384500,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537384500,"counter":510,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 September 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
