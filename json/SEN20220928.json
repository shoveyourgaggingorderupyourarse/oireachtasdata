This matter was billed as being for the Minister for Transport, but I know that the Minister of State is very competent and able and has his hand across all aspects of government.<\/p> <p>My matter relates to the ambitious Galway hydrogen valley project.  On 14 April 2022, I met, as did a number of Oireachtas Members, with the Taoiseach at the Port of Galway conference on renewable energies and the opportunities particularly for the west of Ireland.  The Taoiseach spoke very supportively not only of the Galway hydrogen valley project but also of hydrogen generally and the challenges that face our ports.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, I read in one of the national newspapers last weekend that there are still huge challenges, particularly with the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, which, basically, will be the marine planning authority in time.  I read about how we need to be prepared, ready and responsive to the challenges of renewables.<\/p> <p>The Port of Galway has a plan or project called the Galway hydrogen hub, GH2 for short.  It has enormous potential and is a game-changer for the west.  I support it and commend the Port of Galway on its ambitious plans for the first hydrogen valley.  The hydrogen valley recognises the ecosystems that link hydrogen, research, production, distribution and transport for end users as well as the challenges facing all those associated with this project.  Everything is doable, however, and that came out very much at the conference.  The potential is enormous, as I said, for the hydrogen valley in Galway.  It will deal with and enable renewable strategies.  Sustainability and decarbonisation are key objectives for the Government and are now at the very heart of public transport policy, and that is important.  I acknowledge genuinely the Government's progressive steps in this area across all Departments in respect of renewable energies.  The focus, as the Taoiseach said, is on supporting this project in Galway.  It is very well supported by the private sector, industry, Galway City Council and all the stakeholders, and they were present in large numbers at that conference and engagement with the Taoiseach.  The challenges in this regard, as I said, are renewable energies.  It is clear there is a future for sustainable growth.  This is clearly an exciting project.<\/p> <p>Finally, I pay tribute to the Port of Galway and its board, the city councillors and the stakeholders, who are really committed to this hydrogen valley plan for Galway.  When I left for the west for those few days and visited a number of sites, it was clear to me that the region is energised and, indeed, that the west is awake.  This is a wonderful project.  I would like to hear what plans, energy and focus the Department of Transport is giving to this very important project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#A00800","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Senator is right to be excited, interested and encouraged by what is being done in Galway.  It is really positive.<\/p> <p>As he rightly noted, sustainability and the need to decarbonise lie at the heart of transport policy, as set out in commitments under the programme for Government, the national development plan, NDP, the whole-of-government climate action plan and key strategies such as the national sustainable mobility policy.  Against the backdrop of a shift away from fossil fuels and towards clean and green energy sources and fuels, renewable hydrogen has rightly been identified as one of several technologies with the potential to decarbonise hard-to-abate transport sectors.  Those include the long-haul road transport and the maritime and aviation sectors.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who apologises that he cannot be here, has a strong understanding of this potential role for renewable hydrogen as part of a wider energy sector transition.<\/p> <p>The Minister has also a keen awareness of the need to identify the best investment and policy landscapes within which renewable hydrogen might be deployed to support transport decarbonisation objectives.  This requirement, supported by strong evidence and data and industry insights, is particularly important, because while the Government's political commitment is clear, the policy framework to implement and support the delivery of green hydrogen in Ireland is in its early stages of development.<\/p> <p>In that context a hydrogen strategy is being developed as a key priority within the national energy security framework by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The strategy will outline the pathways towards the production of green hydrogen and its use in Ireland's energy mix.  The consultation for the strategy is under way and it will be considered on a cross-governmental basis before being finalised this year.<\/p> <p>Pending the publication of the planned national hydrogen strategy, the Department of Transport has put in place a range of initiatives and measures to support potential early movers in hydrogen mobility.  These include grant support for the purchase of heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, some of which we have seen in action already; an accelerated capital allowance tax incentive for purchasers of hydrogen vehicles and associated refuelling equipment; hydrogen bus technology trials on suburban public service obligation routes in Dublin and Cork, including in my constituency; and a proposal that, from 2023, green hydrogen should receive quadruple credits or certificates that could be offset against the national obligation on supply of renewable fuels for transport with the potential to create a market value of benefit to suppliers of green hydrogen for use in transport.<\/p> <p>Building on these initiatives, the Department engages with many industry stakeholders in an advisory capacity concerning policy on the development of green hydrogen as a future renewable energy for the transport sector.  The GH2 consortium the Senator mentioned is among those groups, and the Department has engaged with the consortium since 2021.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Policy advice recently provided by the Department has included a statement of the current policy context for renewable hydrogen in transport to inform the consortium's proposed hydrogen valley project.<\/p><p>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure Ireland is at the cutting edge of scientific and technological innovation, the Minister for Transport has also identified renewable hydrogen for transport as a key element of his Department's climate research programme.  To that end, working with counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive and as part of the Government's shared island initiative, the Department has commissioned research on the potential for cross-Border co-operation to inform the approach to implementing hydrogen refuelling infrastructure across the island.<\/p><p>The first phase of this research is underway and is assessing the options concerning safety regulations for possible future hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, including best practice and guidance on interoperability and delivery.  A second phase of research, which is expected to be commenced next year, will involve a feasibility study concerning the delivery of transport refuelling on a cross-Border basis on the island of Ireland, including examining the criteria for optimising location and use.  Within the overarching framework of the Government's forthcoming hydrogen strategy, these research projects will support and inform the next steps in the consideration of hydrogen development for transport and the possible future procurement of the delivery of public hydrogen refuelling infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#A00900","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.

My Commencement matter relates to the loss of commercial rates as a result of the closure of Lough Ree power station in Lanesborough in 2019, with which the Minister of State will be quite familiar.  It has been a major blow to employment and local economic activity in the regions of County Longford, Offaly and Shannonbridge, which suffered a negative impact from the loss not only of commercial rates but of the plants themselves, as well the potential loss from suppliers of the plant, including Bord na M&oacute;na.  Lough Ree power station paid a total of &euro;1.2 million in rates annually to Longford County Council.  It was the single biggest ratepayer in Longford and accounted for 15% of the rate base.  To sustain a loss of that magnitude in one year and to compensate on the income side, we would need to pass on an increase of 13.5% in rates to balance the books.  I do not think that would be acceptable.<\/p><p>Indeed, we were the first county in Ireland to vary the local property tax, LPT, rate upwards, at 15%, a decision made when all local authority members in Longford came together to maximise potential funding for other projects where matched funding was needed for projects throughout our county.  We ring-fenced the 15% increase for the local authority to allow us to apply for projects and ensure we have matched funding for them.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister of State, through his Department.  The council successfully resolved this critical issue for the financial year 2022.  Without that support, there would have been a severe impact on the ability of the council to respond to the challenges it faced.  It has meant the council has been able to operate with a level of certainty in what has been a very challenging year.  Businesses in the county are recovering at a slower pace than many urban settings.  Coming out of Covid-19 and additional challenges facing the sector, such as inflation and the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis, compound the impact of the loss of the guaranteed income from the Lough Ree power station.  However, the support the Department has given over the past couple of years has allowed the council to continue to respond with confidence, undertake the regeneration projects we spoke about, invest in our housing stock and continue to support communities and businesses throughout the county.<\/p><p>However, the financial jeopardy caused by the decision to close the power station and the resulting loss in rates remains a difficulty for 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026.  I was elected to the House in 2020 and in September 2021 I sought a guarantee.  I have asked for a commitment from the Department and Government to provide certainty to Longford County Council until 2026.  The just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey, stated two and a half years ago that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt would be extremely unfair in circumstances over which they had no responsibility and for a decision which was not expected until 2027 that they should be burdened with this sudden loss.<br \/><br \/>I recommend that an urgent engagement takes place with the Chief Executives of the councils concerned with the funding Departments so that a suitable emergency arrangement can be agreed to alleviate the rate losses over the period 2021-2026. <\/blockquote> <p>While we have successfully received the rates every year, the decision is not made until the end of September.  Our department of finance in the local authority is putting together financial projections for the year ahead.  The situation creates uncertainty.<\/p><p>I wish to take this opportunity to wish our head of finance, John McKeon, well.  He has been ill for the past number of months.  He is a prudent financial officer in Longford County Council.  We look forward to seeing him back in the chair in the finance sector of Longford County Council.<\/p><p>We should get, and need, certainty today.

I wish to be associated with his comments on John McKeon.  I spoke to him yesterday and he is out of hospital after seven months.  That is a huge achievement for him in terms of getting through his illness.  He is a credit to the local authority in Longford.  I am sure he will be back at work shortly.  I look forward to engaging with him again.<\/p> <p>As I said, I thank Senator Carrigy for constantly bringing this issue up with my office.  I acknowledge the funding pressures on local authorities generally, and specifically the negative impact on the commercial rates income caused by the closure of the Lough Ree power station in Longford.  It is recognised that the authority was very reliant on rates from the now closed power station which, as the Senator said, accounted for approximately 16% of the rates receipts for the county in 2019.  To alleviate this negative impact, my Department has provided compensatory funding to the local authority at a cost of &euro;1.4 million in 2021 and &euro;1.3 million in 2022.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am pleased to confirm that this arrangement will continue in 2023, with support of &euro;1.3 million being secured as part of the recent budgetary process.<\/p><p>As committed to in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, the move to 100% retention of local property tax, LPT, will take place in 2023.  All equalisation funding will now be met by the Exchequer to ensure that all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their baseline.  This increased equalisation requirement will come to &euro;118 million in 2023.  The LPT allocation to Longford for 2023 will be &euro;8.9 million and this will include &euro;6.9 million of equalisation funding from the Exchequer.  As the Senator may be aware, all local authorities have the opportunity to increase or decrease their basic rate of LPT by 15%.  I acknowledge the elected members of Longford County Council for recently taking the decision, as the Senator outlined, to increase the rate by 15% for 2023 and 2024.  This upward variation on what is a relatively low base will lead to almost &euro;300,000 in extra income for 2023 alone, which should be of great assistance in what is a challenging financial time ahead.<\/p><p>The Government is making a significant contribution of &euro;333 million in 2023 to support the local government sector.  A large portion of this figure, totalling almost &euro;199 million, will go towards assisting local authorities with the cumulative effect on pay costs arising from the national pay arrangements and the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  This allocation will ensure the sector will have the necessary resources, in terms of people, to perform its functions and provide in excess of 1,000 essential public services to citizens.  Furthermore, as in previous years, my Department will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of any additional pay increases that are confirmed for 2023.  While the individual allocations for 2023 have yet to be confirmed, it should be noted that Longford County Council will receive &euro;1.6 million towards increased payroll costs for 2022.<\/p><p>I am very aware of the current financial environment in which local authorities are operating and, in recognition of this ongoing pressure, additional support of &euro;60 million has been secured for the sector as part of the budgetary process. This funding is additional to the &euro;333 million already secured towards LPT, payroll and other miscellaneous schemes.  The purpose of this additional funding will be to assist Longford County Council and other local authorities in meeting the increasing costs involved in providing a wide range of services.  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the issues facing the sector at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#B00700","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that commitment to funding but, as I stated, multi-annual funding is needed.

Mr. Kieran Mulvey, the just transition commissioner appointed by the Government, recommended that a multi-annual arrangement be put in place up to 2026.  That is the minimum needed.  We do not want our finance department to be doing the books again next year and trying to prepare for the year ahead without knowing what the financial situation will be.

It is welcome that an additional &euro;7.3 million is being allocated to TG4.  Slightly separate but equally important is the establishment of the new media fund, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, the film, television, animation and content creation sector continues to boom.  The Government has in place an audiovisual action plan that was adopted in June 2018.  The report of the Future of Media Commission sets out several objectives in respect of where media and content creation in Ireland will go.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which will soon be passed by these Houses, will result in the establishment of a new media commission.   As part of that, there will be a content levy fund to help with production.  All of that is positive but we need to look at the longer-term strategy.  How can we ensure that Ireland becomes a global hub for content creation, attracting international film and television production, but also look at how we can support culturally significant Irish production?<\/p> <p>There is a lot of good news in the creation of new studio space.  For instance, there is the development of Hammerlake Studios in Mullingar.  More recently, An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved planning permission for Tara Studios, just north of Gorey, on my home turf, which will be the largest film and television production studio in the country.  In a short time the amount of studio space in Ireland will almost quadruple.  We have excellent independent production firms based here but there is also strong interest from streaming companies and other international production companies in coming here.  We have all the right conditions.<\/p> <p>It is important that we get clarity in respect of where responsibility lies between the new media commission and Screen Ireland with regard to film development and promotion, and also whether there is a role for the Arts Council.  In the context of the review of section 481, it is concerning that the Department of Finance always regards it as almost cost-neutral.  We need to look at those figures again because there is a genuine benefit to the economy from having international film production based here.  It is not just the money that brings into local economies where the films are being shot and what is generated here domestically, it also relates to tourism and the image of Ireland that is projected internationally.<\/p> <p>We are extremely lucky.  At the moment, \"Vikings: Valhalla\" is being shot at Ashford Studios, while we culturally significant and beautiful films such as \"An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in\" have been produced.  This is a real boom time for the Irish content creation industry but we need to look at where we are going in the next decade.  By the way, content creation is not confined to film, television and animation.  We need to consider how we will provide content for the metaverse and to support some of those new technologies.

Culture and creativity are and will remain at the heart of Government policy, but our continuing priority is to ensure this creativity is allowed to thrive with the necessary supports.<\/p> <p>The audiovisual action plan was launched in June 2018.  This is an industry-wide, long-term plan under the Creative Ireland programme, developed to support the Government's ambition to enable Ireland to become, as the Senator wants, a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation.  The tax incentive for the screen industries the Senator mentioned, section 481, has been a cornerstone of the Irish screen industry since its implementation in various forms in 1987.  Its legacy speaks for itself in the creative and cultural value it has generated, both in terms of discovering and supporting new Irish voices, as well as showcasing Ireland's power as an international partner and a cultural force across film, television and animation, not to mention a breath-taking location offering historical and natural beauty.  As the Senator will be aware, the Minister for Finance announced the extension to section 481 beyond the current end date of 2024, until December 2028, which gives certainty to the sector.<\/p> <p>The economic value of section 481 is also important in what it brings to our industry in terms of infrastructure, upskilling and further training for crew.  It cannot be underestimated in this endeavour.  I heard what the Senator said but research has shown that 87% of mobile productions confirmed that they would have not located their production in Ireland without the support of this incentive.<\/p> <p>The pilot basic income for the arts scheme was introduced in September for 2,000 artists.  Some 204 of these are recorded as working in film, which is the third largest category after visual artists and musicians.<\/p> <p>The Department recognises the enormous success of the Irish screen industry to date and the economic and cultural power that this sector produces both at home and abroad.  The Department has been proud to support Screen Ireland throughout and, in particular, to provide further supports in the budget.<\/p> <p>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, was delighted to showcase and promote the Irish screen industry during a recent trade mission to Los Angeles.  One of the main reasons we have a consulate in Los Angeles is that the film industry, and the creatives and investors connected with it, are located in the area.  The purpose of the meeting was to build on those international partnerships by updating key industry partners on the continued evolution and success of the sector in Ireland.  The Minister was able to emphasise and continue the ongoing Government support for the Irish screen industry.<\/p> <p>Last year was a record year for screen production in Ireland.  This is extraordinary post Covid and demonstrates resilience and innovation in the industry in Ireland.  The &euro;500 million spend in 2021 on jobs and local goods and services was the highest ever achieved.<\/p> <p>In film, the Cine4 scheme has produced incredible feature film work in the Irish language, from the sweet and heartwarming recent release \"R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank\" to, as the Senator mentioned, an scann&aacute;n &aacute;lainn \"An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in\", a cuireadh le ch&eacute;ile agus a taifeadadh i mo Dh&aacute;ilcheantar f&eacute;in.  That is obviously a box office record-breaking milestone for Irish-language cinema.  It has been remarked upon in incredible reviews the world over.  The growth of local Irish TV drama has almost tripled in production spend since Screen Ireland began to support the sector with development funding in 2015.<\/p> <p>The Minister and the Government remain committed to supporting the Irish screen industry and continue to engage with Screen Ireland and stakeholders on issues important to the sector.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne and the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sports and Media on the recent launch of the report, A Safe and Respectful Working Environment in the Arts.  It was highly appreciated.  Well done to all involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#D00200","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I am glad to hear of that strong commitment.

In the review, perhaps the Department of Finance underestimates the potential benefit of section 481.  However, I am glad the research recognised that without section 481, we would not have the current levels of film production based in this country.  I am heartened to hear about the existing production.  The audiovisual strategy and reports from the Future of Media Commission will have to inform that debate.

It recognises how united the screen industry proved to be by pulling together and working towards a common goal.  The screen industry in Ireland provides a tangible economic benefit to our country through jobs, skills development, regional development and production spend on local goods and services.<\/p> <p>There is an even more essential cultural value in supporting Irish creative talent, telling Irish stories on screen and connecting with audiences at home and around the world.  In uncertain times, we turn to the artist as a guide.  Artists provide us with shared experiences that remind us all of the importance of identity, community and belonging through the stories they tell.  Times come and go, people come and go and the economy goes up and down but the things created - art, poems, movies and books - stay and offer all of us lessons in times of difficulty.  <\/p> <p>We will continue to engage with key stakeholders and professionals to understand the challenges in the sector.

It was attended by hundreds of people &ndash; there was standing room only with people out the door - concerned about the future of Clifden District Hospital, which is used for respite convalescence and has been used for palliative and end-of-life care as well.  There is concern because individuals in the community were told by the HSE to take their loved ones out of the facility by 3 p.m. on Sunday or 3 p.m. on Monday.  This causes huge concern in the community.<\/p> <p>Issues regarding rostering and difficulties between unions and management on the amalgamation of practices between St. Anne&rsquo;s nursing unit and Clifden District Hospital have had an impact.  It is now clear that there is more to this.  Issues with recruitment and the availability of nurses and physiotherapists seem to be at the heart of the problem.  This is reducing the number of referrals from Galway University Hospital, GUH, which is impacting on the ability to have convalescent and step-down facilities.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Government intervene with the community healthcare organisation, CHO, to ensure that it has an appropriate recruitment programme in place for Clifden District Hospital, that it engages with local doctors regarding palliative and end-of-life care and that it ensures there are referrals from GUH for local people who wish to be cared for and visited by their families in the local community.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was certainly always the case in Clifden District Hospital pre-Covid.

It is great to have a collaborative approach.  It is very effective.  I am acutely aware of the significant healthcare role that Clifden District Hospital plays and the excellent level of care and support which it provides to patients and their families in the local community and surrounding areas.  Just after the meeting the Senators organised on Sunday evening, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v contacted me at approximately 6.10 p.m. to explain the issue to me, exactly as the Senators have done.  I asked that evening for a briefing note from the HSE for first thing the following morning in order that I would know exactly what was happening.<\/p> <p>As the Senators have said, in recent years, Clifden District Hospital has been primarily designated to provide convalescence care to patients stepping down from acute hospital.  However, with the evolution of Sl&aacute;intecare and the transition of care from acute to community settings, the need for step-down beds has reduced.  In fact, the demand for step-down care is currently an average of less than one patient per day.<\/p> <p>Clifden District Hospital also provides respite beds to allow family carers in the community a welcome break.  Following a meeting with local politicians and residents in July, Community Healthcare West repurposed some of the convalescence beds to accommodate those requiring respite.  I have been advised by the HSE that the average respite demand and occupancy is approximately three beds per night.  This brings the total average occupancy of Clifden District Hospital to 3.2 beds per night.<\/p> <p>In the Clifden area, St. Anne's community nursing unit is a designated centre registered with HIQA to provide a home for older people.  My understanding is that it is approximately 1.5 km from Clifden.  Unfortunately, St. Anne's has faced significant challenges over many years to secure sufficient nursing staff, despite national, international and local recruitment drives.<\/p> <p>In recognition of service needs in the Clifden area and in order to seek to redress the nurse staffing shortage, HSE Community Healthcare West commenced a process two years ago under the Croke Park public service agreement.  In August 2022, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission conciliation services, Community Healthcare West informed the Irish Nursing and Midwives Organisation and SIPTU that it would be issuing a common roster, which commenced on 26 September, covering both Clifden District Hospital and St. Anne's community nursing unit sites in order that staff could be assigned across both sites, based on service needs.  The change in rosters involves a change in shift start or finish times of a maximum of 30 minutes and working in one of two locations less than 1.3 km apart.<\/p> <p>I have been advised by the HSE that one of the staff representative bodies communicated with the HSE on Friday, 23 September to suggest that it had instructed its members not to co-operate with the revised rosters.  Community Healthcare West is committed to ensuring the safety of its residents and patients and, accordingly, put contingency arrangements in place in light of any potential action by staff from 26 September onwards.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, over last weekend, the HSE was unable to secure cover to fill the rosters due to gaps in St. Anne's community nursing unit which the HSE required to fill to ensure the safe care of residents and patients.  Community Healthcare West therefore started to develop contingency arrangements for the patients in Clifden District Hospital.  Patients and their families were contacted by HSE nurse management and all patients were offered the alternative option of Merlin Park University Hospital should they wish to avail of respite this week.  I understand it is approximately 80 km away, which is a long distance.  Day care services will continue as normal.<\/p> <p>I will clarify that Community Healthcare West has not advised that respite services will end in Clifden District Hospital but simply took contingency measures following advice it received that staff may not co-operate with the new roster.  The contingency measures will be implemented only if there are insufficient staff available.  In these instances, alternate respite slots can be sought at a later date or patients can be accommodated with a respite bed in Merlin Park.  There are no plans to cease respite services in Clifden District Hospital at this time.  I have asked the HSE to keep me updated on any developments.  I will come back with a further reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#E00400","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's reply is similar to what we have received in communication over a long time.  There are no plans to cease services but it is happening.  Services are being reduced and it is not possible to get palliative care.  There is no physiotherapy and therefore there are no referrals.  Of course the referrals from GUH have dropped because physiotherapy is not available for those who need convalescence and step-down care.  This is the crux of the problem.  There is a problem with recruitment that needs to be addressed by the community healthcare organisation, CHO.  I ask that the Minister of State intervenes with the CHO to ensure there is adequate recruitment to the facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#E00500","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>We appreciate the Minister of State coming here.

The first is staffing.  There has to be a dedicated approach to try to find staff in the short term to continue these services.

My focus will be there.<\/p> <p>I have every intention of speaking with the chief officer in Community Healthcare West to see exactly what is happening on the ground.

I want to acknowledge the work done by all Ministers in particular, in getting this budget passed last night.<\/p> <p>There were issues mentioned in the budget debate pertaining to education.  We had a significant debate in this House in the past few weeks regarding school transportation.  I was hoping there would be some light shed on the conversation we had with the Minister about a budget for affected children who had not been picked up so far in the school transportation scheme.  Will the Deputy Leader use her good offices to inquire about that proposal with the Minister for Education?  The Minister said she had been talking to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, about getting a budget in place.  Can we get an update on this proposal for a budget to pick up the children not covered by the school transportation scheme?  It is a huge issue in my part of the world.  There are hundreds of kids who are not yet sorted.  Will the Deputy Leader use her good powers to come up with some kind of timeline for when we can resolve this issue? <\/p> <p>We had an usual and unfortunate announcement two days ago regarding Shell pulling out of the country.  Shell was a major backer of two important offshore wind farms; one off the coast of Clare and one off the coast of Cork.  It was part of our policy to make sure we would be sustainable going forward in order to reach our targets of proposed renewable energy in 2030 and 2050.  These two wind farms were not even reaching 3 GW.  I am not sure of the correct terminology.  To have Shell pull out at this stage is really significant and we need to have a clear debate about where these two major proposals are going.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has continuously said that the wind potential we have off the coast, particularly the south coast, was going to be a key factor in making sure we reach those guidelines.  I am genuinely concerned by this announcement by Shell.  It is a global powerhouse when it comes to renewables.  It has switched from fossil fuels in the last five years and has a huge concern in Scotland when it comes to renewable energy.  For Shell to now leave the Irish market has a worrying effect when we take into consideration our cost-of-living issues regarding fuel prices.  I call again on the Deputy Leader's good offices to arrange a debate with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about how we are going to deal with the renewable resource we have and what work can be done to make sure key actors like Shell will not leave the market again.  If they do, the knock-on implications mean reaching our targets will be unachievable without this kind of investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#G00500","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I will address the first point that Senator Lombard raised regarding school transport.

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, was very understanding of the situation so many families and students found themselves in.  My understanding is that this funding is in place and that the task now is for Bus &Eacute;ireann to sort the extra buses and drivers.

The clarification yesterday that 16- to 18-year-olds in third level education will be able to avail of this extension, as indeed will mature students over 23, was particularly significant.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That was particularly significant yesterday.  In my own area of Kildare there will have been some disappointment that the extension of the short-hop zone was not mentioned.  That is something I am certainly very committed to for up to 50 km, indeed it is now Fianna F&aacute;il policy, as is the extension of the medium-hop zone to 75 km.  <\/p><p>A number of us met a lot of different people around Leinster House during our pre-budget meetings.  One of the groups that had a profound impact on me was the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  The Deputy Leader will know Laura Reid Costello, whom we would have known before she had her traumatic injury.  She is a wonderful woman, full of energy and vitality, who is inspirational in so many ways.  It is incredible to see how far she has come in the last three years.<\/p><p>I was also fortunate to meet Dr. Rosie Mangan from Daingean in Offaly, who had a most unfortunate car accident while she was doing research in Brazil and had to be airlifted back to Ireland.  Their asks were really important.  Rosie has to travel four hours every day from Daingean to a place called An Saol in Dublin.  We all know that the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire does incredible work but it really can only take a small number of people at any particular time.  An Saol does really excellent work.  Brain injury surpasses many diseases as the major cause of disability.  The vast majority of people under 65 who are in nursing homes are there because of acquired brain injury.  We absolutely need to do everything we can to help support this cohort, including ensuring that An Saol receives extra funding.  Only two out of our nine community healthcare organisations have dedicated teams in respect of acquired brain injury.  This commitment was made back in 2019.  We need to follow up on it.  I would appreciate if the Deputy Leader could organise a debate in the Seanad on acquired brain injury.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#G00600","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I welcome to the Visitors Gallery, James Stokes from Kildare, who is on a placement with the Ceann Comhairle.

He is very supportive and favourably disposed to Ireland and its various circumstances.  It will be an interesting visit to the House which I welcome.<\/p> <p>On local government funding, today Fine Gael's Senator Carrigy made a really strong case on the shortfall of funding for Longford.  I salute him for it.  In the local government press clippings that I review every morning, I see we have situations in Roscommon, Galway city and county, Cork and Longford just to name a few.  They are the considering the challenges across their local property tax.  The local property tax baselines are meant to be under review in the coming months but there is a shortfall, and local authority budgets are coming up.  Local authorities are finding they do not have sufficient finances to roll out their services.  Overnight, Cork County Council talked about not being in a position to provide core activities in terms of cleaning, cleansing and various essential works in its own area because of a shortfall funding gap of &euro;24 million.  That is challenging.<\/p> <p>Most of us in this House have been members of local government.  We know the challenges around the finances of local government and the pressures that the elected members of our city and county councils come under in balancing their books.  They do not want to be cutting services.  They want greater efficiencies and it is important that we talk about greater efficiencies when we talk about additional resources for local government finance.  Senator Carrigy touched on something very real to Longford.  Indeed the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, was here today and is very committed to it.  However, it is a bigger issue and we cannot just have special arrangements and special local authorities.  We need to address the issue comprehensively.  How are we going to have a proper line of sustainable funding for the future of local government?  If we are serious about providing greater powers to local government we have to address this issue.<\/p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach, who has gone, and the Clerk of the Seanad, Martin Groves, and his team for the enormous work they have done to date on Seanad 100.

I thank Martin and his team both in the Seanad Office and built around him, as well as the team that have produced the wonderful booklet we will see later and the impressive line-up of activities for Seanad 100.  We are going to have a great celebration that is appropriate and measured and that relates to our core activity and our pioneering legislative work in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is going to be a great period from now until the end of the year.

My colleague, Senator Boylan, referred to it yesterday as well.  I hope we all share concern about the growth of far-right governments in Sweden and now in Italy.  It is important for people to speak out.  It concerns me that prominent parties both in the European People's Party, EPP, and in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, are actively coalescing with these fascist parties.  The Liberal Party, a member of the ALDE group, is actively planning to coalesce with the Sweden Democrats, an outrageously right-wing, far-right racist group.  Similarly we see Forza Italia from the European People's Party doing the same.  I know enough good people in the EPP and ALDE to know that an awful lot of the people do not share those views.  However, they have to speak out.  It took years for people to speak out about Viktor Orb&aacute;n when he was in the EPP.  We should not take that long.  There is this horrific trend towards far-right governments.  It is important for all of us to speak out and, I hope, agree on a common platform of keeping fascists out of government.<\/p> <p>On an altogether more local point, I have frustration and good news on bus services in Limerick.  I have to sing the praises of the Clare-Limerick Local Link group, which has worked in collaboration with a number of elected representatives and is working actively on a new bus service to link a small townland called Montpelier with my village of Castleconnell.  People were cut off from their own parish by a swift change in Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  In fairness to the National Transport Authority, NTA, after I contacted it, it immediately linked in with this group.  We had a really positive meeting last week and are having another one this week in Castleconnell to marry the needs of these residents with the residents who want to go to university, and potentially join up a new bus service that will serve an awful lot of people in the catchment area of Castleconnell and Montpelier.  It is really welcome.<\/p> <p>I am so frustrated that while we can see what can be done, the people of Castletroy in Limerick are still waiting for a replacement bus service that was disbanded in early July by Dublin Coach.  We have a massive new student population arriving in the University of Limerick who are dependent on buses in Newtown, Castletroy and Monaleen.  The same National Transport Authority that responded so well on the first issue is just dragging its heels.  It has told me funding is approved to replace the service but I cannot get any answer from the NTA about when that service will come in or how negotiations are going.  We are three months on, there is a large, growing population in Castletroy and they have no bus service.  I do not know how other colleagues have experienced the National Transport Authority.  I know there are good people working in there but I do feel frustrated in terms of accountability at times.  This should not be rocket science.  If there is funding in place for a bus service it should not take three months for that service to be put in place.  Perhaps that is something we could revisit and debate at some stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#H00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I rise today to speak about two things.

It began its detached street work in the past six to eight months.  Street work and outreach work were used in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s when there were no resources and services in communities such as Tallaght.  It was a way to work with people in their communities, at the shops or in the fields.  It was usually with the most marginalised.  Those who need the most help are usually the furthest away from it.  Sometimes we need a special type of intervention.  Sometimes this can involve some of the young men and women who are probably seen as problematic by other members of the community.  They should be the people targeted by those working in youth work to bring them closer to the services.  The new detached youth work street team in Killinarden, Glenshane and Jobstown is doing amazing work.  I have watched them with some of the young men nobody has worked with for years.  They are now running 10 km and holding their own football tournaments.  These men were hanging around the shops, smoking, selling and doing all sorts.  They are beginning to be engaged again with a very targeted intervention.  It would be nice for us to look at some of these scenarios and see how we can enhance funding and the development of specific targeted work such as this.<\/p><p>It would be great if the Leader could write to the Minister for Health on my next issue.  I was a key worker and worked in addiction services for a long time.  I used to be able to make referrals for the people the service was supporting, for example, into Cuan Dara, which is a HSE-funded service.  Some of the policies always had something written in that referrals would have to be done by an addiction counsellor.  The understanding of most was that most communities cannot afford addiction counsellors and neither can the people themselves.  Community services cannot afford to hire addiction counsellors.  We have addiction practitioners who have been working for ten, 20 or 30 years in the field.  Some of the HSE-funded residential treatment places are no longer taking referrals from those working in addiction services.  They are enforcing a policy whereby it must be done by an addiction counsellor.  This means far fewer people are seeking residential places.  There are many projects in a precarious situation because they cannot support the next stage of recovery for those they are working with.  The HSE or HSE-funded projects have decided to impose a rule that referrals must be made by an accredited addiction counsellor.  There is just no access to accredited addiction counsellors.  It feels like a policy that should not be used.  We should be able to recognise the qualifications, history and knowledge of those working for addiction services.  They are best placed to make these referrals themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#H00500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy Leader will indulge me when I congratulate my fellow county woman, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, on achieving one of the most striking aspects of the budget yesterday, which was the announcement there would be free primary school books from September.

It is directly in line with the philosophy of Donogh O'Malley to provide free education, Paddy Hillery to introduce community schools and Brian Lenihan to introduce free school travel.

It is based on reaching out in friendship and co-operation to people who do not share our religion or political views.  The shared island project threatens nobody.

The support for it has been niggardly.  Some of the most nationalist journalists in the northern papers have thrown cold water on it consistently.  They have referred to it as weak.

It has gone from 9% to zero and this will give the industry a fighting chance to survive.  What will help the industry to survive is people buying newspapers.  Yesterday when the Minister for Finance was making his announcement in respect of the reduction from 9% to zero, at the very same time he was trying to give the newspaper industry a chance, we saw Mediahuis release an announcement that it was closing one of its newspapers, the <i>Fingal Independent<\/i>, a newspaper I worked at for a decade.  My heart went out to all of the journalists and employees of the publication, which has been in existence for more than 40 years.  To make this announcement during the budget speech, when the Minister was giving the industry a chance, was a pure disgrace.  It is a warning sign to many other local newspapers throughout the country of the perilous state in which they find themselves.  Perhaps the industry that campaigned so hard for a break will give its own employees a break and think twice about shutting the door not only of a newspaper but what is a local record for many communities the length and breadth of this country.<\/p><p>I welcome the announcement at the weekend by the GAA that former President Mary McAleese has agreed to chair the integration process between the GAA, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association.

Between 2008 and 2019, there was a 56% reduction in the granting of special exemption orders, SEOs, which allow nightclubs and night venues to open from 12.30 a.m. until 2.30 a.m.  They cost &euro;410 per night, plus legal fees, and are a complete racket.  They make it almost impossible to run venues, particularly on a Sunday night.  They are not transferable, which means that if an act, a DJ or a band is cancelled, the venue cannot get its money back and the dates cannot be changed.  An SEO is required per night of opening from 12.30 a.m. to 2.30 a.m.  There is nothing special about opening until 2.30 a.m.  Ireland is a modern European state.  We should have a system that reflects that.  The introduction of an annual charge at a nominal fee for nightclubs, night and cultural venues and the creation of a dedicated nightclub and night venue licence are the grounds on which we should be discussing the sale of alcohol Bill.  I hope the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, will publish that Bill as soon as possible.  I have been talking to people in the music industry today.  They say that people should not be told that the fees are being waived because it has been a difficult couple of years.  They say that the fees should be abolished because it is a ridiculous system and it is a racket that bleeds money from the cultural system into court and legal fees and excise duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#J00500","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#K00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I apologise to Senator Malcolm Byrne.

It is only now that the HSE has decided to seek a replacement.  We know how much of a shortage there is of speech and language therapists.  It is not acceptable, for those families and young people who are impacted and need access to a speech and language therapist, that the HSE did not make alternative plans quickly enough while knowing this post would be vacant.

I want to put on record of this House that this is a massive budget for carers.  People from Ahascragh, Strokestown and Roosky rang me this morning - I did not ring them - to say that this will bring a massive improvement to the lot of carers.  Let us put it on the record that Government Members, members of my own party and my Senator group, have been working consistently on this to make it happen for carers.  It has not achieved everything, but it has achieved a lot and we will achieve more for them in the years ahead.  Let us put this on the record and let us keep it straight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#K01200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Iarraim ar an gc&eacute;ad cainteoir eile, an Seanad&oacute;ir Dolan, at&aacute; as an D&aacute;ilcheantar c&eacute;anna.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#K01300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, is doing a press conference in the Department of Education.

It is crucial this measure is implemented as soon as possible.  Concerned families in Roscommon and Galway have been in touch with me.  It has been four weeks since schools went back and it is now nearly October.  Families cannot find a way to bring their children to and from school.  They have had to give up jobs.  We know how stressful things have been for them over the past four weeks.  I am delighted to hear the Minister has brought forward this budget.  She has secured more than &euro;100 million, &euro;90 million of which is for one-off additional funding measures for heating in schools and &euro;10 million of which will be allocated to fuel for school transport.<\/p> <p>The Minister has also very clearly indicated there is an understanding from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that costs will be met around children and families who have applied for bus tickets.

Ireland's signature is conspicuously missing from that letter and I would like an explanation from the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as to why that is the case.  If he will not introduce an energy price cap at a member state level, why will he not at least support such a price cap at an EU level when 15 member states are calling for it?  They are doing so because they know the only way we can put downward pressure on the inflationary pressure that is coming and give certainty to households is to have a price cap.

That has an impact on our disability services, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and schools.  Families are telling us we simply are not supporting them with what they need.  It was announced in the budget that psychology traineeships for counselling psychologists would be funded in the same way as clinical psychologists.  That means that, when they are doing their traineeships, they get 60% towards their university fees and a salary.  However, educational psychologists have been left out.  There are three streams, only one of which was funded up until now.  People received a salary for the hundreds of hours they worked and funding towards their fees.  Counselling psychologists will now get that funding, but educational psychologists have been left out.  I do not see the sense in that.  It costs &euro;15,000 a year after people have done their undergraduate degree.

Senator Lombard welcomed yesterday's budget.  We can all agree it was a significant budget, with a level of spending not surpassed by any previous budget.  My view and that of my Government colleagues is we have delivered on the promises we made to look after the most vulnerable, to give a break to all families and households, and to try, as best we can, to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures every single person in the country is dealing with, no matter where they are.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of school transport, as did Senators O'Loughlin and Dolan.  It was welcome that in yesterday's budget the Minister, Deputy Foley, secured additional funding to put on extra bus services for those students who have yet to receive a school bus place.  It is important to acknowledge that, when school transport was made free for this academic year, it was with the best of intentions, and many families benefited to the tune of more than &euro;600, which is a huge cost saving for many families throughout the country.  The demand for bus places was not anticipated at the level that transpired.  There have been particular bottlenecks in some parts of the country in getting spaces, in particular for those with concessionary tickets.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, has secured extra funding and it will now be the job of Bus &Eacute;ireann to secure extra drivers and buses to get children to school.  We are probably moving to a place where we no longer have eligible and concessionary bus applicants.  Any child who wants to get a bus to school should be facilitated, not just because it is greener and better for the environment but because there should be an offering that ensures every child gets that service.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin spoke about the extension of the 20% reduction and 50% reduction in fares for children on public transport, which applies to private services.  She made a particular point regarding short hop zones which have not yet materialised.  It is something for which she is pushing.  She also spoke about the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, one of many organisations she met in pre-budget discussions and which left the biggest impact on her.  She referenced Laura Reid Costello, whom I know, and Dr. Rosie Mangan.  Both women acquired a brain injury and are now advocating on behalf of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland to try to get extra services, in particular for An Saol, which does fantastic work.  She has requested a debate in the House on acquired brain injury, and that debate will be facilitated at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan welcomed the Order of Business, in particular Lord John McFall's address to the Seanad.  He raised issues around local government funding, which we will all be very aware of, and the need to bridge the gap where local authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to provide basic services like keeping areas clean and tidy and providing services to citizens.  He also thanked Seanad staff for all of their work in terms of preparing for Seanad 100.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about the rise of the far right, which Senator Byrne answered very eloquently.  He also acknowledged those in glass houses should not throw stones.  He spoke in particular about bus services in Limerick, Castleconnell and Montpelier, his local area, and the ongoing issues with providing bus services in rural areas, something with which I am quite familiar.<\/p> <p>Senator Ruane spoke about community safety and police safety in the context of recent debates we have had in this House and wider society.  She wanted to draw attention to some positive news, namely, interventions that are working well such as the detached street work in west Tallaght, something that is reaching out to those who are among the most marginalised in our society who need to be brought back in.  I was not aware of the issues around the accredited addiction counsellors versus addiction practitioners.  If the Senator wants to talk to me after the Order of Business, I might be able to set up a meeting with the Minister for Health and see whether we can progress that.  The experience of practitioners working in the field for decades should not be discounted.  I do not know why there has been a change in policy to enforce the outdated requirement to refer people on.  There should be no barriers to getting people the help they need.  I ask the Senator to speak to me after the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan wanted to congratulate his county colleague, the Minister, Deputy Foley, on what was a monumental investment in education.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Primary school books across the country will now be free of charge.  He spoke about the move being in the vein of Donogh O'Malley bringing in free second level education or the introduction of free school transport in terms of the focus on ensuring equality of access to education for every child in the country.  He also called for a debate on the shared island unit and I have made that request.<br\/><br\/>Senator Maria Byrne welcomed the announcement by Ryanair of 2,000 jobs up to 2030 and, in particular, the fact that 200 of those jobs will be at Shannon and there will be an investment of &euro;10 million in a new hangar at Shannon Airport.  She wished Mary Considine and the team at Shannon Airport the very best with that investment.<br\/><br\/>Senator Cassells spoke about the budget announcement of the reduction in the VAT rate on local newspapers from 9% to 0%.  I agree with the Senator.  All present understand the importance of local papers.  They are the papers of local record, reporting on local government, local sports and local issues.  If we did not have local media, we would not have that record for future generations.  I know the announcement has been very much welcomed by the industry.  I take on board his comments regarding the <i>Fingal Independent<\/i>.  It is unfortunate that that announcement coincided with the Minister's budget announcement yesterday.  I concur with his remarks on the former Uachtar&aacute;n, Mary McAleese, and wish her well chairing the integration process between the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, the Camogie Association and the GAA.  It is long overdue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Warfield spoke about the night-time economy.  I concur with his remarks.  In many areas across the country, there is such a significant cost burden associated with having a late licence that many venues choose not to hold such a licence.  In my home town of Castlebar, there are no premises with a late licence because it is not seen as viable or sustainable and, as a result, there is no night-time economy in the town after 11.30 p.m. or 12.30 a.m., depending on the day.  I suggest that the Senator table a Commencement matter to the Minister for Justice on that issue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about the HSE decision-making process.  All Senators would agree that if a person such as a speech and language therapist has given advance notice of going on maternity leave, the HSE is on notice then to get a replacement to fill the post for the duration of that maternity leave.  It should not be hiring a replacement when the person has already gone on leave, leading to a gap in services in a local community.<br\/><br\/>Senator Conway welcomed the budget announcement yesterday, particularly the abolition of the inpatient hospital charge.  The abolition has been welcomed by the Irish Cancer Society, which did a fantastic job campaigning for it.  The Senator also welcomed the free school bus provision.<br\/><br\/>Senator Murphy spoke about the budget and made the point that, in particular, it was a good budget for carers.  I absolutely agree with his remarks.  It represents &euro;1,600 back into the pockets of carers, which is approximately &euro;30 a week.  It is a significant increase that has been welcomed by many carers across the country.<br\/><br\/>Senator Dolan spoke about school transport.  I have dealt with that issue.  I concur with her remarks in respect of it being a much-needed investment.  Senator O'Loughlin helpfully informed the House that, in getting these extra buses and bus drivers on stream, those who had concessionary tickets previously will be prioritised in the roll-out.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boylan spoke about the energy commissioner and the letter that was sent.  I am not sure why the Government did not sign up to that.  As regards a price cap domestically, I think the T&aacute;naiste spoke on this issue this morning.  There are concerns that if a domestic price cap is implemented, the State will pick up the tab at the other end.  It is not as though it does not get paid; it has to be paid for by somebody.  There is a concern that if we are heading into a global downturn, which looks likely, prices could come down.  The Government believed the best way to assist citizens here was with the energy credit of &euro;200 that will be paid at the end of this year and a further two payments of &euro;200 in the new year.  That is &euro;600 of direct payments to every household in the country to try to meet the increasing cost of energy, which is a significant recognition on the part of the Government that this is a real problem for people and is putting a lot of pressure on them.  That coincides with increases in welfare payments and fuel allowance, as well as the expansion of fuel allowance to take more people into the bracket.  Every effort is being made to ensure we protect households, particularly the most vulnerable, by trying to offset the increased cost of energy.<br\/><br\/>Senator Currie spoke about therapeutic services for children.  Not a week goes by in this House without that issue being raised.  All Members are receiving representations on it.  It is heartbreaking.  Parents are at their wits' end.  They are so exhausted that they can barely fight for services for which they should not have to fight.  The issue in respect of educational psychologists not being included would be a good one on which to table a Commencement matter.  It probably warrants a broader debate in the House, so we might seek to have statements on it in the coming weeks, but I also suggest that the Senator table a Commencement matter on it.  It is something we have to get to grips with because we are losing precious time as each year goes by.  It is not early intervention if it is happening at eight, nine or ten years of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#L00400","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy Leader for that comprehensive and individualised set of responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#M00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664357400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Address to Seanad \u00c9ireann by the Rt.

I wish to speak also to amendment No. 58, which is a Government amendment in the group.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 58 proposes changes to the application of the 2015 Act, including decision support arrangements and the validity of advance healthcare directives, AHDs, to persons whose involuntary mental health treatment is regulated by Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  This matter was raised in the pre-legislative scrutiny report back in April and has been raised throughout the various Stages of this Bill, including by Senators in the Second Stage debate.  I am pleased to be able to introduce these amendments today and show the commitment my colleagues in government and I have to making progress on this matter.<\/p> <p>I stress that the amendments being introduced today are not the final word on this matter and acknowledge that more is needed to achieve full parity of care.  While it remains the case that fundamental reform of involuntary care under the 2001 Act is a matter for the reform of that Act under the Department of Health, the amendments being introduced today signify an important move away from a paternalistic, best-interests approach and extend supports to cohorts previously excluded from the supports under the 2015 Act.<\/p> <p>Persons whose involuntary treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Act must meet the definition of \"mental disorder\" within the 2001 Act.  I am using the terminology used in the Act.  Nowadays we would regard it as inappropriate, but, with regard to what I am talking about amending, I have to use the definitions contained in the Act.<\/p> <p>Under the 2001 Act, a person may be treated under Part 4 if there is an immediate and serious likelihood of that person harming himself or herself or another person or where, in the opinion of the relevant clinicians, treatment is required to improve the condition or a condition would deteriorate without treatment.  Reforming treatment considerations where a person may be likely to cause harm is a more complex undertaking than can be achieved in this Bill, despite all the efforts that have been made.  Therefore, I cannot, at present, extend decision support arrangements to the A category spoken of, nor can I extend it to persons whose detention arises from a referral from the criminal justice system, due to several complex technical and legal issues.  However, along with Senators present and advocates, I remain committed to continuing to move towards parity in this area.  I look forward to the fundamental reforms that the Minister for Health will bring to the 2001 Act, which I know Senators are involved with and will address the necessarily more fundamental reforms related to how the law should address the issue of possible harm.<\/p> <p>In dealing with the amendments before us, I must address the 2001 Act as it stands.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to extend the Act's provisions in their entirety in that regard.  Notwithstanding this, amendments I am introducing today will extend the provision of assisted decision-making supports to those treated under the B category.  This will ensure a clinical view of a person's best interest will no longer, by itself, be placed above that person's own will and preference and that a person's will and preference will prevail.  This represents a significant extension of the provision, and I hope it will benefit the treatment of those whose treatment has not to date been within their control.<\/p> <p>On the question of a significant extension of the application of advance healthcare directives, I acknowledge there is more work to be done.  With regard to our very extensive engagement with the Department of Health over the summer, we believe this is as far as we can go in this legislation.  The remaining elements may be addressed within the reform of the 2001 Act, which I am aware has been subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny.  I hope to get a full draft of the associated Bill from the Department of Health shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#T00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I am very grateful to Ber Grogan of Mental Health Reform for helping out with much of this over the past few months.  I am also very grateful to Dr. Fiona Morrissey of NUIG, who has also been very helpful to me.<\/p> <p>An advance healthcare directive is a statement set out by someone when he or she has the capacity to make decisions about his or her will and preferences for care and treatment in the future.  The directive comes into effect if and when the person becomes unwell and no longer has decision-making capacity.  People can make advance healthcare directives regarding a broad range of issues, such as the types of medication they prefer and types of therapies that work best for them, in addition to refusals of treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy or certain medications that cause intolerable side effects for them.  An AHD enables a person who experiences mental illness to make plans while healthy.  If complied with, it gives people the peace of mind of knowing that their wishes will be respected even when they are at their most vulnerable and unable to fully advocate for themselves.  They are essential tools used to uphold the dignity and agency of people experiencing mental health difficulties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are a source of security and safety amid the fear and chaos that can accompany mental ill health.

This is a cause of major anxiety for people who are impacted by this.<\/p><p>Irish research on AHDs undertaken by Professor Fiona Morrissey was extremely helpful to me in developing my understanding of this issue.  The research shows that they can reduce involuntary admissions and promote recovery.  It is a phenomenal piece of work that Professor Morrissey has done.  AHDs improve outcomes, save the State money and protect people from potential harm.  As the legislation currently stands, people who have been involuntarily detained will have their AHDs disregarded.  This is a massive betrayal of trust and it cannot be allowed to continue.  Removing the greatest protection of an individual&rsquo;s agency and freedom to choose, a document that is made under conditions of health incapacity creates a significant risk of abuse.<\/p><p>The Minister knows that Ireland has obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability, UNCRPD.

They have been casting an eye over it, advising and putting forward different ways in which it could be tied in with human rights.  A question has come up on which I ask the Minister for clarity.  It may just be my reading of this but I am not at all clear about how the Government amendments address the AHD exclusion for involuntary people.  AHDs were always legally binding where a person was not detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act.  The text still states that the AHD shall be complied with unless the person is detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Act.  From my reading of this, it still excludes involuntary people from legally binding AHDs.  When this legislation was going through various discussions and Stages I understood that the Government would only exclude people detained under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  However, the wording here seems to suggest that those detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 will also be excluded.  Is this a technicality or am I and others misreading it?

The idea that a document that is legally binding in many circumstances and is put together when the person has absolute capacity could be suspended in any circumstances is appalling.  Has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, been consulted on this?  I expected these amendments to be more strongly in support of people with mental ill health.  As much as we desperately need to have this Act in place for many good reasons, I question the wisdom of proceeding if it has to be done in conjunction with mental health legislation that will not come before the House until some point in the future.  The idea that people in the State will find themselves in a position of absolute powerlessness when they could have had a voice, one which they had put in place themselves, is unacceptable.  I am deeply uncomfortable with codifying that.  I would like to understand whether this has been proofed by the IHREC?  Some of the cases described to me on the telephone are outrageous.  We cannot have an inherent bias in how people are treated when they have mental ill health.<\/p> <p>I have now become alive to all that it happening in the committee chaired by Senator Black.

My understanding is they have gone or are going through the pre-legislative scrutiny process with the committee.  Once that pre-legislative scrutiny process is over, the outcome will influence the final draft that will be brought to Cabinet.  The process is advanced and we are awaiting the final draft of the legislation to come to Cabinet.  I can seek a little more clarity from the Minister for Health before Report Stage when I will be able to give more clarity.  It is a matter within the remit of the Department of Health but, as I stated, the heads of Bill have been done and a pre-legislative scrutiny process has taken place.<\/p> <p>In regard to the questions from Senators Hoey and Seery Kearney, under the 2001 Act where a person's treatment is involuntary, it is regulated by Part 4, which is divided into two subsections.  The first is where there is deemed to be an immediate and serious likelihood of the person harming himself or herself or another person.  The second is where, in the opinion of the relevant clinicians, treatment is required to improve a condition or a condition would deteriorate without treatment.  Under the existing legislation, both of those circumstances allow for involuntary detention under Part 4.  As the Bill originally stood, in both of those circumstances an AHD would not apply.  The amendment I am bringing forward today will allow an AHD to apply in the second of those circumstances, where, in the opinion of the relevant clinician, treatment is required to improve a condition or a condition would deteriorate without treatment.  Where a person is detained under this subsection in Part 4, the exclusion contained in the original 2015 Act on the applicability of AHDs will no longer apply.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, it will still apply under the first subsection.

We absolutely see the importance of AHDs and of legislating for the situations about which Senator Seery Kearney and others have spoken.  However, part of that requires changes to, and a much broader revision of, the 2001 Act.  That is within the remit of the Department of Health and will require a systematic review and revision of that legislation.  We have advanced the situation by broadening the application of AHDs and narrowing the exception that is provided for in the Act.  There is a strong recognition within the Department of Health that it needs to take up its part of the work now in respect of the revision of the 2001 legislation.

There is also the question of where we stand in regard to the ratification of the optional protocol to the UNCRPD and whether these amendments will be acceptable in that regard.  Do people have a right to take litigation outside the State when there is a cultural bias against people with mental ill-health?  That bias is a fact that has been proven again and again.  Unfortunately, in some instances, the people who are giving evidence as to how they are being discriminated against are the very people who are not being believed and who, due to their particular condition, find themselves labelled as lacking in capacity.  They are in an incredibly vulnerable position and now we have this provision being left in legislation that disempowers them even when they have put a document together and have capacity.<\/p> <p>There is a combination of issues, which include denying people the power they could have, our slowness to ratify the optional protocol and our refusal to make provision to empower people within the Bill.  The approach is not centred on the very people to whom this legislation is intended to give a voice.  We should ensure that the most vulnerable are supported by the legislation and that they have a voice all the time.  They do not have a voice and we are managing to codify that deficiency.  I am a member of a party of government, which means one takes the hits and votes with the Government even when one personally disagrees with a particular measure.  I will find it very hard to do so today but I will do it because I do not believe in suddenly picking and choosing the issues on which one supports one's party.

The reason the Bill was not passed before the summer was to allow for a pause in which we engaged extensively over the summer with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Health on this specific matter.  There was a focus, in particular, on the issues that arise when people are detained under the Mental Heath Act and the basis for their detention is that they are a risk to themselves or to somebody else.  We looked at people's ability in that context to refuse treatments that might lessen their potential risk to others and the balance that can be achieved in that regard in the law.  The legal advice I have received is that this balancing mechanism is best done through reform of the Mental Health Act, not in this Bill.  The second category of persons, who are not covered by the relevant Part, are those whose involuntary detention is due to the opinion of the relevant clinician that treatment would improve their condition or their condition would deteriorate without treatment.  Under the amendment I am bringing forward, those persons will be able to rely on the provisions of their AHD.<\/p> <p>The Government has made a commitment to sign Ireland up to the optional protocol to the UNCRPD.

My Department, in conjunction with others, is conducting a review to see what other legal issues need to be addressed before we are in a position to sign up to the protocol.

Risk is not a neutral term in a disability context.

We have all heard stories of how people have been treated.<\/p> <p>All the evidence demonstrates that people with psychosocial disabilities are at increased risk of being subject to violence and abuse.  I wonder whether this creates a two-tier approach to the validity of AHDs, where a person can rely on one where he or she is detained on the ground that he or she requires treatment and that can only be provided at an approved centre, but not where the person is detained where it is believed that he or she may be at risk of causing harm.<\/p> <p>Will the Government create situations where someone may believe his or her AHD will be binding, should he or she be subjected to the Mental Health Act but may, nevertheless, be forcibly treated?

One teenager is subsequently brought in unconscious, perhaps it is drug-related or accidental, and the advance directive is found in his or her pocket.  Under the UK Act, a doctor, knowing that the patient is fully salvageable and may be helped, can make a pragmatic decision to treat the patient and save his or her life, suspecting that the patient perhaps did not intend to apply the advance healthcare directive in this particular scenario or perhaps changed his or her mind.

We are dealing with legislation that is long overdue.  I still do not have a clear understanding why the 2015 Act was not initiated or used.  However, I have been given the job to do that and that is what I am seeking to do in this amending legislation.<\/p> <p>Some very legitimate concerns have been raised about one element of this legislation.  My Department and I have listened to them in terms of slowing the process, undertaking engagement and looking to see how we can solve this particular issue.  The difficulties with the 2001 Act in a 2023 situation are relevant to this issue and those Senator Warfield listed out in terms of the issues that the Mental Health Commission has raised.  That is why it is incumbent on all of us, Government and Opposition, to get mental health reform through both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>I am certainly committed, and I am more committed having gone through this process, to using my role as a Minister to deliver that reform.  However, in terms of what I can deliver in my role in this particular legislation - which is not centred on reform of mental health legislation, but on assisted decision-making &ndash; having seen the very real issues that Mental Health Reform and others have raised, I brought forward a solution that addresses some of those issues.  I have been very upfront; I am not addressing the whole thing.<\/p> <p>However, as someone who believes in progressive politics and moving the line forward all the time, what I see happening here is us moving the line forward.

That is what I would speak to the process and where we are in it, and my belief in terms of pushing the line forward as far as one can in each particular step.<\/p> <p>I am happy to engage with Senator Doherty.  Reading this and listening to her, I have a concern in that it seems that a consequence &ndash; I need to go through it in detail &ndash; would be that an advance healthcare directive legitimately made is being disregarded because of a particular view a medical professional took at a particular time.  In many ways, that is almost the antithesis of what the advance healthcare directive is about.  That is not to say the Senator is not raising a legitimate issue.  However, when officials and I looked at it, we thought that was problematic.  Like I said, I am happy to speak further to Senator Black and engage further with Senator Doherty on that issue.  However, I just want to put on the record that I would need significant convincing in terms of either the issue or, indeed, the approach being adopted. <\/p> <p>I wish to come back to something Senator Seery Kearney referenced in terms of people coming in and treatment.  The advance healthcare directives apply to voluntary admissions.  What we are talking about here is involuntary admission under Part 4 of the legislation.

I am keeping in my back pocket the right to call a quorum today in case I need more time to look for it.  If I call a quorum, Senators will know what I am doing.  The proposed amendment calls for the deletion of lines 36 to 40.  There are concerns both in terms of process and the impact it will have on the human rights of people with disabilities, older people and people with experience of mental health services.  At a procedural level, this amendment, which has significant implications for the rights of disabled and older people, was introduced on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It was not properly discussed as the debate was guillotined prior to the full reading of all the proposed amendments.  Making such a drastic provision without the full input of both Chambers of the Oireachtas is problematic.<\/p><p>More fundamentally, by retaining and recognising inherent jurisdiction within the Act, the State risks undermining the entire rights-based system of supported decision-making which it seeks to create, and allows the court to continue in parallel a secondary system with little guidance or oversight.  This effectively overrides the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and its principles, especially the central guiding principle of respect for the will and preferences of the person.  Indeed, family members or service providers can avoid the entire system if they have the resources to commence proceedings seeking orders from the High Court under the inherent jurisdiction.  Under the inherent jurisdiction, the court has no obligation to consider the will and preferences of those of whom it makes orders regarding their detention and treatment without consent.  This provision has been of significant concern to human rights activists but also to lawyers practising in the area.  It was noted by Ciara O'Dowd that instead of using inherent jurisdiction to fill any lacunas in legislation, the Government in recognising it within legislation is effectively nullifying the Act with regards to treatment and detention.  This amendment was inserted into the Bill and will undermine the entire rights-based system the Government is purporting to create.  It should therefore be removed.  Its removal from the Bill does not mean that the inherent jurisdiction will cease to exist or can never be used but it sends a powerful signal that it is not to be considered as a means to circumvent the positive and rights-affirming aspects of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#Y00900","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>The proposed amendment seeks to delete provisions that were made as amendments on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was drafted to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.  However, the Act remains non-compliant with the CRPD.  This is because the Act contains a functional test of mental capacity as a means of determining whether a relevant person can exercise his or her legal capacity.  This approach results in a form of what is called \"substitute decision-making\" rather than supported decision-making.  The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in general comment No. 1 states: \"The functional approach attempts to assess mental capacity and deny legal capacity accordingly\".  It goes on to say: \"Article 12 does not permit such discriminatory denial of legal capacity, but, rather, requires that support be provided in the exercise of legal capacity\".<\/p> <p>Despite this clarification, Ireland introduced a reservation to Article 12 upon ratification, signalling its intention to maintain systems of substitute decision-making.  When Ireland enters into dialogue with the UN committee in Geneva, like other countries before it, it will be asked to consider removing this reservation and to commit to the full implementation of supported decision-making as required by the CRPD.<\/p> <p>Ireland was among the first countries to reform its capacity law in light of the CRPD and could claim to be a world leader in this domain again if it removes the functional test of mental capacity and abolishes all forms of substitute decision-making, as countries such as Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia have done in their subsequent reforms.  While these are relatively recent, they have been developed as a result of decades of activism by disabled people&rsquo;s organisations and the grassroots in each country, and these reforms have been subjected to intensive parliamentary scrutiny and have had broad support from the Judiciary, law commissions and academic researchers.<\/p> <p>In a report on pre-legislative scrutiny, the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recommended that the functional test of capacity should be removed and replaced with an obligation to acknowledge, interpret and act upon the relevant person&rsquo;s will and preferences, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  These were made in pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations Nos. 11 and 15.  The wording of this amendment is drawn primarily from a draft statutory framework for legal capacity law reform in Canada and developed by two leading scholars on legal capacity worldwide, namely, Michael Bach and Lana Kerzner.  If accepted, it would require the tabling of further amendments on Report Stage to reframe the eligibility criteria for the different types of support and intervention under the 2015 Act.    <\/p> <p>A similar amendment was offered on Committee Stage debate during the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, although at the time no countries had reformed their laws in light of Article 12 of the CRPD.  However, now there are three examples of countries which have developed legislation to replace adult guardianship that is fully compatible with Article 12 of the convention as interpreted by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#Z01200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I am speaking specifically here, by leave of the Chair, to amendment No. 4 by way of a discussion on the section.  That amendment seeks to replace section 3 of the 2015 Act, which sets out the functional capacity model, with a replacement text on legal capacity.  The amendment mixes two separate provisions.  As Senator Warfield is aware, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for a presumption of capacity in section 8(2) dealing with the guiding principles.  Section 8(7) already requires an intervener to give effect to the relevant person's will and preference.  As such, the provision proposed by the Senator with regard to the recognition of legal capacity is already contained in the original 2015 Act and, importantly, the commencement of the 2015 Act will remove wardship, thereby removing a system which explicitly removed a person's legal capacity.  I completely recognise the importance of legal capacity, not least under the UN CRPD.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is the position of the Government that the operation of the functional model is qualified in an important and rights-based fashion in the Irish context by that explicit respect for a person's will and preference throughout the operation of the functional capacity model in both the 2015 Act and the amending legislation.<\/p><p>Section 3 has a different purpose.  It is to provide a test that will apply where an intervenor seeks to intrude on the decision-making autonomy of a relevant person.  Such a test is necessary to protect the rights of the relevant person as a decision-making supporter should not be appointed unless absolutely necessary.  Removing that test could lead to a situation in which decision supporters would take it upon themselves to take decisions on behalf of another person unnecessarily, even with good intentions.  Respecting the person's autonomy is a key value underpinning the 2015 Act.<\/p><p>The Senator's provisions imply a test is needed.  The subsection 2(b) they propose refers to the appointment of a person to support the relevant person in exercising his or her legal capacity.  Inevitably, the appointment of such a person would involve some form of process that would most likely be based on a set of criteria by which that person's situation was evaluated.  What section 3 provides is such a set of criteria, putting in place the limited circumstances in which a decision supporter can be appointed with authority to help another person with decisions.<\/p><p>The place of the functional capacity model in the Act, uniquely qualified by the will and preference in the Irish context, is designed to maximise a person's decision-making capacity in a manner that explicitly privileges their explicit will and preference.  It is contrary to the prevailing system of wardship.  Assisted decision-making will allow a person to hold and exercise legal rights and obligations.  While I appreciate the intent of the amendment being discussed, examining section 3 of the Act in isolation is not helpful in assessing the Act's overall recognition and enabling of legal capacity.<\/p><p>On a technical note, there is language in the proposed amendment that I could not accept.  It is not appropriate that a decision-making assistant would guide the decision of a relevant person.  This could be construed as leading a decision and is beyond the remit of a role, which is to assist a relevant person in their own decision-making.  The term \"best interpretation\" is not a term used elsewhere in the 2015 Act.  It is problematic and unnecessary given the application of will and preference set out in the guiding principles section of the Act and the superior legal clarity provided by the existing section.  For that reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#Z01300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>For some of the reasons the Minister outlined, I do not support the amendment but I know and agree with what the Senators are getting at.  Maybe the best way I could address the issue would be to ask how we will supervise the use of the functional test.  A very strong recommendation of the committee following the pre-legislative scrutiny was that the functional test be removed.  This is because it speaks of a medical model rather than a social model or a model that is absolutely person centred.  I understand the need for the test in some instances but it seems to be a relic of a former system that needs to be reviewed.  Without the UNCRPD, there is some impotence in that the person has no recourse to somewhere outside the State to review the implementation process and whether the entire system is actually person centred and supports the individual's needs.  Therefore, I have concerns about the safeguards included to ensure the needs of the individual are safeguarded.  Unfortunately, if there is a dispute after the event, an individual who may have been ill, perhaps for a brief period, will have to give evidence along with individuals who may be medical practitioners of various sorts.  It is very difficult to dispute how a test was carried out in the aftermath.

Cultural change is something we discussed to a great extent in respect of other legislation, the Birth Information and Tracing Act, which is very much about moving away from a hierarchical, patriarchal model of decision-making.  How is that changing in this legislation?  I briefly mentioned the principles section in section 8 of the 2015 Act, the original Act.  To further my understanding, I find it useful to consider the Act as a whole, rather than a specific section, and also the notion of the will and preference of the individual being interwoven throughout.  Let us examine some of the guiding principles set out in section 8 of the Act:<\/p> <blockquote> \t8. (1) The principles set out in <i>subsections (2)<\/i>to <i>(10)<\/i>shall apply for the purposes of an intervention in respect of a relevant person, and the intervener shall give effect to those principles accordingly.<br \/><br \/>(2) It shall be presumed that a relevant person who falls within <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>of the definition of &quot;relevant person&quot; in <i>section 2(1)<\/i>has capacity in respect of the matter concerned unless the contrary is shown in accordance with the provisions of this Act.<br \/><br \/>(3) A relevant person who falls within <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>of the definition of &quot;relevant person&quot; in <i>section 2(1)<\/i>shall not be considered as unable to make a decision in respect of the matter concerned unless all practicable steps have been taken, without success, to help him or her to do so. <\/blockquote> <p>A range of safeguards is set out in section 8.  There are ten elements to it.  The key point is that the presumption of capacity is at the absolute centre of the legislation.  Second, that presumption can be rebutted only where all efforts have been made to assist an individual in terms of their capacity.  Everything we are doing in this Bill is to assist people to be able to exercise their own capacity.  That is central to what we are achieving.<\/p><p>On the question of how we examine this, a key component is the decision support service.

The amendment seeks to have the guiding principles interpreted in line with the United Nations convention and, in particular, Article 12 and general comment 1 of the UN committee on the CRPD.<\/p> <p>While recognising the proposed amendment is well-intentioned, my position has not changed since earlier Stages and I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  It is problematic from a legal perspective as the provision is insufficiently clear for inclusion in primary legislation.  I would also argue it is unnecessary from a policy perspective.  The convention was drafted as an international treaty, not as a measure for direct inclusion into primary law.  Taken as a whole, the convention is too large to allude to in the manner proposed.  The text of the convention is primarily by way of statements that set out a standard that contracting parties should aspire to achieve across their respective legislative programmes.  From a technical perspective, the language of the convention does not lend itself to inclusion in primary legislation.  Rather, it sets general principles which must then be translated into more specific obligations to be introduced into national law.<\/p> <p>General comment 1 is not drafted as a statutory provision, but rather as a textual guide to the relevant sections of the convention.  It would be highly unusual and legally problematic to grant such language the force of domestic law in the manner proposed.  Aside from the technical difficulties with the amendment, since ratification of the convention by Ireland, there is an overarching and existing obligation on public bodies to be compliant with the CRPD.  This means that the obligation the amendment intends to create already exists as a matter of domestic law without the need for the proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#BB00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Would Senator Warfield like to speak to the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#BB00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chair for his patience.

Once again, we find ourselves in a situation whereby the dreaded Standing Order 41 interferes with the ability of Members to put down substantive amendments which deserve to be considered.

I encourage Senator Clonan to consider bringing forward his amendment on Report Stage, or at least raising the issue again on Report Stage.  Perhaps the Minister might consider it.  That might be a more relevant request.  In advance of Report Stage, we could examine whether it would be appropriate to appoint an independent advocate in certain situations.  Such a person would assist regarding the appointment of a decision-making assistant under a decision-making assistant's agreement under section 10 of the Act or the appointment of a co-decision maker under section 17.  Such a person would assist the relevant person. <\/p> <p>I mentioned the committee recommended that the Bill provide for independent advocates.  I understand it might have been recommendation No. 35.  What we are talking about arises in particular in the context of intellectual disabilities.  As we all know, Senator Clonan is very well qualified to speak on this issue, and more qualified than I am, but I am very happy to support his very laudable agenda in these matters.  Parents of adult children have concerns that children could be exposed to undue influence in regard to appointing decision-making assistants or co-decision makers.

Section 38(5) and 38(6) of the 2015 Act set out criteria for the appointment of decision-making representatives.  Section 38 (5) states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhen considering the suitability of a person to be a decision-making representative for a relevant person, the court shall have regard to the following:  \t(a) the known will and preferences of the relevant person;<br \/><br \/>(b) the desirability of preserving existing relationships within the family of the relevant person;<br \/><br \/>(c) the relationship (if any) between the relevant person and the proposed representative; <br \/><br \/>(d) the compatibility of the proposed representative and the relevant person;<br \/><br \/>(e) whether the proposed representative will be able to perform the functions to be vested in him or her;<br \/><br \/>(f) any conflict of interest.   <\/blockquote> <p>Paragraph (e) is important in ensuring there is an assessment of the ability of the decision supporter to meet the needs of the particular relevant person.  If the particular relevant person has any sort of estate that needs management, the ability of the decision supporter to meet those needs would be considered.  There is more detail in section 38(6) which states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhere the court appoints a decision-making representative to make decisions on the relevant person&rsquo;s property and affairs, it shall have regard to the following:  \t(a) the size, nature and complexity of the relevant person&rsquo;s financial affairs;<br \/><br \/>(b) any professional expertise, qualification or experience required to manage the relevant person&rsquo;s financial affairs;<br \/><br \/>(c) the capability of the proposed representative to manage the relevant person&rsquo;s property and affairs;<br \/><br \/>(d) the financial expertise and support available to the proposed representative.   <\/blockquote> <p>That covers and addresses, maybe in slightly different language, the important point the Senator set out. <\/p><p>Decision supporters would be subject to the oversight of the DSS.  They have to report to the service on their management of financial assets.  <\/p><p>Another important point in this legislation is that the decision supporter is there to assist the relevant person.  If the relevant person, having been recognised as having capacity, makes bad decisions, he or she is entitled to under this legislation.  That is an important issue.  We are moving away from the situation where the court, through the ward of court system, knows best.  The relevant person's capacity is recognised, including his or her capacity to make a bad decision.  That is relevant because it is no longer a question of the decision supporter minding the relevant person's money; it is a question of the decision supporter supporting the relevant person to make the decisions that he or she believes are best even if those are decisions that he or she considers not to be financially the best investment.  It is important to recognise that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#DD00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I would be grateful if I could tease this out with him.  I defer to his knowledge of the Bill as he has been with it for a long time.  The amendment specifically goes to an area where a person is making decisions on behalf of another person as a decision-making representative.  Is that at the higher level of intervention and support where person A is entrusted with a decision on behalf of person B?  The Minister is bringing the legislation through the Houses.  Regarding the final point he made, while I understand the spirit underlying it, this is about releasing people to exercise their wishes in every situation and to support them to the extent they need to be supported having regard to a particular issue where they may lack capacity to some degree or at a particular time or in a situation in which they lack capacity.

He is standing back from imposing a requirement in the law that directions in respect of the decisions that must be taken are given.  Is that the nub of this?  The Minister rightly points to the testing and the required qualifications of the person who will be entrusted with this decision support, but Senator Clonan's amendment asks for more because it asks for the giving of directions in respect of the investment strategy.  I do not wish to speak for Senator Clonan, but that seems to me to be a different issue.

Yes, it is very important an individual is entitled to make whatever decisions he or she wishes to make and that he or she should be supported in making those decisions.  There is an enormous difference between someone making an imprudent decision for themselves and an imprudent decision being made by another person who is entrusted with decision-making and the individual having to live with the consequences of that for the rest of his or her life, along with his or her whole family, which is the case in current circumstances.  To ensure we have that absolutely tight and robust, perhaps we will require engagement before Report Stage.  To date, where sheer recklessness and negligence have occurred, there have been no consequences.  There has been just a moving on to a different system, and those who are left behind are left behind and that is it.  That is not right, and I will continue to speak up on those people's behalf because it is necessary.

I think Senator Mullen is correct that the concept behind the legislation is that the decision-making representatives, having met the criteria they have set out, are qualified people and it is not necessary again for the court to start specifying to them the types of strategies that will be taking place in the decision-making representation order.  It works on the basis that, having met the criteria, they will be able to undertake that.  There is obviously oversight of the process, and if a decision-making representative breaches that, there are offences provided for under the legislation as well.<\/p> <p>The matter can be discussed further, but I am reasonably confident the provision as set out in respect of the detail that is required of a decision-making representative before he or she is appointed is comprehensive and encapsulates the ability to manage financial matters or an investment strategy, as was suggested.

This means individuals who wish to confer powers to consent or refuse health treatment on a trusted supporter at a time when they are not able to communicate their wishes will have to complete a separate advance healthcare directive even if they are also making an enduring power of attorney.  This places an additional bureaucratic burden on the relevant person if they are required to draft two separate instruments with different requirements as to supporting evidence, witnessing and so on.  It would be especially burdensome if the relevant person wishes to authorise the same person who holds the enduring power of attorney as his or her designated healthcare representative to consent or refuse treatment on his or her behalf in accordance with his or her will and preference.  It is inconsistent with the approach in the rest of the Act to exclude healthcare treatment from enduring powers of attorney when decisions about healthcare treatment can be included in any other decision support arrangement under the Act, including decision-making assistance agreements and co-decision-making agreements.  It is also inconsistent with recommendation No. 52 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in its pre-legislative scrutiny that health and medical treatment decisions be retained in the scope of an enduring power of attorney.<\/p><p>Amendment No 31 would restore the original power the Bill proposes to remove from individuals making enduring powers of attorney.  The removal of this power is unnecessary for the Minister's stated purpose of giving clarity to healthcare professionals as to who has the authority to make a healthcare decision where a person lacks capacity.  Sections 12 and 21 of the principal Act clarify that where a person makes a decision-making assistance agreement or co-decision-making agreement that relates to healthcare, such an agreement will be null and void in respect of decisions also covered in an advance healthcare directive if that directive enters into force because the person has lost capacity.  Therefore, it is already foreseen in the principal Act that in situations where one or more decision makers may have authority, for example, in respect of powers to consent or refuse health treatment, the advance healthcare directive and designated healthcare representative take precedence over other instruments.  This provides the necessary certainty to healthcare professionals as to what instrument to follow in this situation.  In addition, this provision will ensure healthcare professionals will not have to check whether any elements of the 2015 Act are engaged beyond an advance healthcare directive before providing treatment, as others appointed under the Act may have health decision-making powers.<\/p><p>Therefore, there is no need to remove the option of individual choice from donors of enduring powers of attorney, who should be able to continue to confer these powers in their enduring power of attorney should they wish to do so, rather than imposing a bureaucratic burden of creating a separate legal instrument with separate witnessing and notification requirements to give effect to their choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#FF02200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>This issue was discussed at some length in the D&aacute;il.  There are two different perspectives on it.  While I understand, as a result of that discussion, the rationale for the amendment, the provisions the amendment seeks to delete are important, in my view, from the perspective of legal clarity.  The 2015 Act was reviewed in detail in the process of preparing the amendment Bill.  Legal experts reviewed these provisions on behalf of the HSE and it was found there is a risk to a relevant person if two decision supporters have equal rights in terms of treatment decisions at a moment of crisis.  If an attorney were to agree to a treatment decision while a designated healthcare representative made the opposite decision, whose view would prevail?  It is possible this would lead to legal cases in situations where the decision supporters are in conflict as to the decision.<\/p> <p>In terms of legal clarity, the provisions in question make clear to medical professionals and clinicians that in the context of advance planning, a designated healthcare representative and the text of an advance healthcare directive are the definitive support and statement concerning a person's treatment decisions.  This clarity is necessary for the provision of healthcare in line with the person's will and preference, especially where swift decisions may need to be made.  In addition, the provisions have regard to the specification in Part 8 of the Act of a series of safeguards and protections as to how a person's treatment preferences are to be complied with, including in certain difficult ethical or medical scenarios.  These provisions are absent from the sections on enduring powers of attorney.  It is preferable to provide clarity that an advance healthcare directive is the appropriate instrument for advance planning in a healthcare context.

It is very restrictive.  It means that treatment decisions can only be provided for in an advance healthcare directive.

Notwithstanding the Senator's effort to address that through having a solicitor certify something, the real concern and motivating factor behind the change we made is the risk that two contrary views may arise when life-and-death decisions have to be made in a serious healthcare situation.

If what we are trying to do here is to facilitate the activation and actions in accordance with people's wishes expressed in advance, and if one has an existing arrangement where all sorts of other decisions are entrusted to a person or persons who may in the fullness of time execute, carry through or activate an enduring power of attorney, should it not be the case that people are facilitated rather than required to go down a certain track?

The EPA is not as specific on healthcare issues and is not designed to give the degree of specificity to a healthcare practitioner that an advance healthcare directive is designed to give.<\/p> <p>The Senator may be correct that the EPA is a better known document but once this legislation is passed, the advance healthcare directive will become better known and understood and the fact that it is better designed to respond and provide the relevant information in these crisis situations will be recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#GG00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I am not a member of the joint committee and others Senators will have engaged with this matter much more than I have.

I wonder whether sufficient account is being taken of that human dimension where people would rather leave the nod to a certain person, for example, an enduring power of attorney, and would be left the freedom to do that.

The concern at play here is that, for the healthcare practitioner, that degree of specificity is really important and that is provided for through the mechanism of the advance healthcare directive.  The preference is that the advance healthcare directive is used because, rather than, as the Senator colloquially put it, giving the nod to the EPA in terms of the decision to be made, there probably needs to be greater specificity for the healthcare practitioner in the particular circumstance.  That is why the legislation is designed to recognise the preferability of using an advance healthcare directive in these circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#GG00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664357400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 32:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 38, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&quot;(5C) Notwithstanding the provision of subsection (5A) and (5B) the donor may authorise the attorney to consent to or refuse treatment for the donor where a solicitor certifies that the donor has received independent legal advice and sincerely and specifically wants to include this provision in the enduring power of attorney.&quot;.&quot;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#GG00800","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664357400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664357400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 51 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>We need to refer back to our discussions earlier today regarding the engagement that will happen before Report Stage in the context of enduring power of attorney and the mental health effect of the competition, so to speak, between those two powers, or those two documents and preferences that are put forward.

We so request because requiring the registration of an EPA after execution will create additional legal work and costs, etc.  Those additional costs might deter people from taking that step and that would not be in the public interest.  It is estimated that 80% of EPAs in the UK never have to be triggered or registered because the vast majority of donors do not lose capacity in their lifetime.  I am assuming, based on the representations that have been made to me by legal practitioners, that a similar situation would pertain here in the Republic and, therefore, registration after execution of the EPA at that stage would prove totally unnecessary in the vast majority of cases, thus creating an additional and unnecessary administrative and cost burden.<\/p> <p>In April, the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recommended the removal of this two-step process for registering an EPA.  In its report on EPAs, the Law Reform Commission recommended that an enduring power of attorney should only be registered once donors have lost capacity to make essential decisions for themselves, and that there is no requirement to register them just after execution.  One of the reasons for registering an EPA after execution was to have any errors regarding EPA documentation rectified while the donor could assist.  However, this is no longer relevant because of the provisions in section 57(b) of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022092800002#HH00900","speaker":"1699"},{"type":"speech","time":1664357400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The reason behind the change being made here was to give the relevant person more autonomy.  The new role for registration with the DSS rather than with the court will be less costly and should be easier to process than is the case under the current system.  The two-stage nature means that for as long as the relevant person has capacity, he or she is in a position to influence or change the various elements around it.  We see that as a positive step, rather than having them locked into a process from early on.  That is the basis for the approach being taken.  It is to better to allow the will and preference of the relevant person to influence what is happening for as long as he or she is in a position to so do, but also in terms of making the process less costly.  That is how we envisage the revised system.
