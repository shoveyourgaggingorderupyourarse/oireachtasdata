We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering and Farrell.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 31 January, which was our last meeting.  Are those minutes agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  I have one serious item to raise, which we will be coming back to discuss.  It relates to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We had an item of correspondence here the last day, reference number 1897.  It was signed by Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement.  We had written to him well before our meeting asking for information about the role of the Office of Government Procurement in respect of the national paediatric hospital.  He summarises the limited role it is playing, said it was established and that there is a procurement process and a contracts committee, called the Government contracts committee for construction.  He states that the hospital board commenced its engagement with this committee in May 2014 and goes on to say that it sought a derogation because of its unique nature.  The Office of Government Procurement, of which Paul Quinn is the chief procurement officer, notes that the derogation was given in respect of working through that committee.  Nevertheless, the contracting and sanctioning authority were responsible all the while.  He addresses the use of the frameworks and of eTenders and provides a summary of the role of the Office of Government Procurement in the procurement arrangements for the national paediatric hospital.  He says his office is at the disposal of the Committee of Public Accounts should we require more detailed information.  <\/p> <p>  What I find totally unsatisfactory with that letter from a very senior Government official is that he makes no reference to the fact that he was a member of the board of directors.  He states that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board commenced its engagement with the Government construction contracts committee in May 2014.  His office provides the chair and secretary of that committee.  He was appointed as a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 2 August 2013 and there is a clear conflict of interest between the two positions, given the derogation, his being a member of the board and his being on both sides of that debate.  What I find more disturbing is that he did not inform this committee of this.  He should have at least highlighted it.  This level of not providing information in response to a letter from the Committee of Public Accounts is totally unsatisfactory.  I accept that he had a dual role.  We were entitled to be informed of that.  This letter is not acceptable from a person of that office.  We know there are issues in respect of that matter.<\/p> <p>  I will take comments on this issue.  I propose that we write back to Paul Quinn expressing our grave disappointment that the information we would expect as a matter of courtesy and candour to be made available to the committee should have been omitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Could we go back to the start of the letter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Yes.

We had sought the information well in advance of the meeting and received this reply with no reference to the fact that Mr. Quinn was a member of the board.  At a minimum, he should have referred to that.  There are other issues on the work programme about the hospital board that we will deal with.

Given that Mr. Quinn is head of public procurement and had that dual role, and that there are questions around management of conflict of interest, I think he should come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Department should also be here if we have a further sitting.  There are now questions about the relationship between the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and about lines of communication in terms of process, that this committee should examine.

I do not want to write a letter to which we are guaranteed a refusal.  It is not good for the committee to be making a request that we know will be refused.

We did not just pick this out of thin air.  It was a piece of information that we required.  Is there going to be any issue if he comes here saying he reports to the board?  If we are going to have an engagement on this, it has to be on his role and responsibility when he was on the board.  Did he report to the Minister?  Was he required to report to the Minister?

The head of procurement, who sat on the board, should also come in.  It is only through this that we can get to the bottom of where this was going.<\/p> <p>  Circular 12\/2010 explicitly states the requirements of a civil servant who sits on a State board.  If we go by what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il, however, all the circulars on this matter are a waste of time and not worth the paper they are written on.  The requirements were also incorporated, verbatim, into the code of conduct for State boards, which was launched in August 2016 by the current Minister.  His responsibility is listed in that circular, as is the responsibility of all civil servants on State boards.  It states when he or she must go to the Secretary General and when he or she must immediately go to a Minister.  There is a process issue here, beyond this whole topic, and that is also an issue for us on the Committee of Public Accounts.  Is this circular being adhered to across the Civil Service?

The steering group was set up in May and the other board in September.  They obviously had concerns back then or they would not have put in these layers of accountability.  It was confirmed to me at yesterday's health committee meeting that attempts were made throughout October, and certainly on 17 October, by the Department of Health to sit down with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss this.  The Department of Health was not able to sit down with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the most amazing and unbelievable thing in all of this, which is why we need the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to come before us.  The budget negotiations were ongoing and the rows between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about budget allocations and overspends were on the front page of every newspaper, but on 9 August the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health were all aware of it.  The Department of Health was trying to sit down with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss it but it never happened.<\/p> <p>  There are multiple issues here.  One of them is the fact that somebody was sitting on the board who was subject to Circular 12\/2010.  Another is that there was a failure to sit down and discuss the issue, despite the fact that everyone was aware that there was an overspend of at least &euro;200 million at this stage.

The meeting of 17 January was with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Prison Service.  We asked the Department to respond to us, in writing, with specific information on two items and we asked the Prison Service to respond on 16 items.  Three weeks later, the Committee of Public Accounts has not had any replies to any of the questions.  It is not acceptable to the Committee of Public Accounts to write out to these two bodies and not receive answers.  Unless we have the response by next Thursday, the same group of people will be back here again.  When we write to an organisation for information, they cannot disappear into the wind and not get back to us.  There has been three weeks with no communication from them.  If we do not have the answers by next Tuesday evening, they will be here on Thursday to tell us why.  They are now formally on notice to be here next Thursday morning at the commencement of business at 9 a.m. if we have not received replies by Tuesday evening.  Can we agree to that?  I propose that this is a procedure we will follow.<\/p><p>If we ask for information, we should receive replies or else an explanation of why it is not possible.  We had to do it once last year and I do not intend to start this year on the same road.  <\/p><p> As we have noted and agreed the minutes, we will move to the next matter on the agenda, namely, correspondence received since the last meeting.  Thank God the correspondence is light because we have been busy over the past few weeks.  <\/p><p> In category A, the first items are Nos. 1913 and 1920 from the Office of the Attorney General, providing briefing material and an opening statement.

I am attending at the request of the committee to assist in its examination of the 2017 appropriation accounts for the Department of the Taoiseach and the President&rsquo;s Establishment.  As the Chairman stated, I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Denis Breen, head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.  The committee will have received, in advance of this meeting, briefing documents detailing the 2017 expenditure and outturn of the Department of the Taoiseach and the President&rsquo;s Establishment as set out in the 2017 appropriation accounts and other supporting documentation.  I propose to briefly outline the role and structure of the Department of the Taoiseach and to give an overview of the Department&rsquo;s 2017 appropriation account as well as an overview of the President&rsquo;s Establishment appropriation account for 2017.<br\/><br\/>The Department of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s work centres on supporting the work of the Taoiseach and the Government both at home and abroad.  The core functions of the Department are delivering the Executive functions of the Taoiseach and the Government, providing the Government secretariat, supporting the Taoiseach in carrying out his duties as head of Government including in relation to the Oireachtas, constitutional issues, protocol, the European Council, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, working with the Office of the President and with the Oireachtas and engaging with the formulation and implementation of Government policy mainly through the system of Cabinet committees, senior officials&rsquo; groups, the programme for Government office and the parliamentary liaison unit.  The Department is responsible for the office of the Taoiseach, as well as providing some support for the T&aacute;naiste and Independent Ministers in Government.  The Department is also the site for the Office of the Government Chief Whip, who also has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office.  We provide support for the Ministers of State assigned to the Department who have responsibility for Defence, European Affairs and for data protection.  The Department also provides the Government Information Service, provides briefing and advice to the Taoiseach on the full range of domestic policy issues and on international affairs, including through the work of the NESC, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred earlier.  The Department also supports the Government in the formulation and implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s EU, Northern Ireland and international policies, including co-ordination across the whole of Government.  We also deliver support services through our corporate affairs division which includes human resources, finance, ICT and other services.<br\/><br\/>In 2017, changes were made to the structure of the Department following the appointment of a new Taoiseach and Government.  These included new Ministers of State, responsibility for Brexit co-ordination moving to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the establishment of new Cabinet committees.  The Department supported the Taoiseach's intensive engagement and negotiations with EU leaders on a wide range of issues, including Brexit.  Through the Cabinet committee structure, the Department engaged with other Departments on a wide range of national policy issues, as directed by the Taoiseach, such as housing and homelessness, climate change, health and justice reform, infrastructure planning and investment, gender equality and disability, economic planning and rural development.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the existing responsibilities, the Department undertook additional preparatory work during 2017 in the areas of pensions reform, Ireland's bio-economy, the national planning framework, the national development plan, Global Ireland - Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025, and the establishment of the North East Inner City, NEIC, programme implementation board.  Press and protocol support services continued to support the large programme of events including the state funeral of the late Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, and visits by Heads of State and senior EU officials.  The Department was centrally involved in supporting the Taoiseach and the National Emergency Co-ordination Group in its response to Storm Ophelia in October 2017.  Across all areas of the Department&rsquo;s responsibility, considerable time and effort also went into answering parliamentary questions, preparing material for use in the Oireachtas, processing freedom of information, FOI, requests, answering letters and queries from the public, organising events, preparing speeches, and responding to media queries.<br\/><br\/>The outturn for the Department of the Taoiseach in 2017 was &euro;27.58 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;36.74 million.  This lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in &euro;9.16 million being surrendered back to the Exchequer at the end of December 2017.  The significant variations in expenditure relate primarily to programme spending.  Under subhead A4 -Tribunal of Inquiry - spending was &euro;3.5 million less than estimated due to the number of legal cost claims settled in 2017 being lower than expected.  Obviously, we have no control over third-party legal costs incurred by tribunals and it is impossible to predict the timing of settlement of third party costs or the level of costs falling due at any particular time.  Under subhead A5 - Commissions of Investigation - spending was &euro;2.4 million under estimate.  The commissions are independent and their expenditure levels depend on the needs and requirements of their investigations.<br\/><br\/>Subhead A1 - Administration Pay -  was also under estimate due to a significant turnover of staff and delays in filling posts at some grades during the year.  Just over &euro;15.3 million was expended on pay and administration in 2017, with the balance expended on programme expenditure.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, quite a lot of our spending is on investigations.<br\/><br\/>The Department&rsquo;s 2017 appropriation account was audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that, in his opinion, the account properly presented the receipts and expenditure for the Department for the year ended 31 December 2017 and that it has been prepared in the form prescribed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also stated that he had no matters to report with regard to the statement provided by me, as Accounting Officer, on internal financial control.<br\/><br\/>My role as Accounting Officer for Vote 1 is very different to that of Accounting Officers for other Votes.  Generally, the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer for the Votes and also the administrative head of the Department and as such can answer for the actions of the Department.  Although I am the Accounting Officer for Vote 1, I have no executive or operational responsibility for the Office of the President.  This is entirely appropriate given the constitutional position of the President.  As the committee is also aware, Article 13.8.1<sup>o<\/sup>of the Constitution states:<\/p><blockquote>The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.<\/blockquote> <p>As Accounting Officer, I obtain assurances that the office operates properly through my direct contact with the Secretary General to the President and from the audit performed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The outturn for the President&rsquo;s Establishment for 2017 was &euro;3.6 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;3.9 million.  This lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in &euro;294,236 liable to surrender back to the Exchequer.  The account for the President&rsquo;s Establishment was audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that, in his opinion, the account properly presented the receipts and expenditure of the President&rsquo;s Establishment for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for that opinion.<br\/><br\/>That concludes my statement to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Fraser"},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fraser.  Before I call the first speaker, I acknowledge receipt of Mr. Fraser's opening statement, briefing note and the annual report for the Department of An Taoiseach for 2017.  I also want to acknowledge receipt of information in respect of Vote 1, the President's Establishment and the opening statement in that regard.  I further acknowledge receipt of the document, The Presidency in Review, 2011 - 2018, which was published towards the end of last year.  That contains some financial information of which the public may not have been aware.  It is welcome that its publication has been achieved.  As a matter of course, the Committee of Public Accounts will be examining all Votes on a routine basis, which is what it should do.  Today's meeting includes an examination of the Vote for the office of the President.  Last year was the first time that we conducted such an examination but it will be a normal part of our work from now on.  We also indicated earlier that we will be reviewing the accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  I do not know if any Committee of Public Accounts has done that before but we will be doing it.  We will also be reviewing the accounts of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I do not know when the commission was last before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Every one of the Votes will be examined by this committee at some stage and there will be no exceptions from now on.

We are joined this afternoon by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and he is accompanied by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  Before we get into the afternoon's business, I want to comment on the private session we had before the break.  Two items came up in the private session and I want to put the result of that on the public record.<\/p> <p>  The first item dealt with correspondence Nos. 1923, 1924 and 1929.  One was from the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, and the other two were from the Ceann Comhairle's office in respect of the same letter.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality wrote to us saying that they believed we went outside our remit in our discussions on the Vote for the Irish Prison Service three weeks ago.  I informed the committee that I had spoken to the Ceann Comhairle yesterday evening on the matter.  The Ceann Comhairle has indicated that the matter is being considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, I think next week.  I am satisfied, as Chairman, that we were within our brief and remit when we discussed the Vote.  Without further discussion, and to inform people, I expect the CPP to deal with the matter appropriately and that the Committee of Public Accounts will continue its work within its remit, as we always do.<\/p> <p>  I shall move on to the next item.  We had legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, OPLA, in Leinster House.  On 28 November 2018, the committee agreed to seek a briefing from the office in respect of section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, following the committee's discussion in respect of NAMA's correspondence on the topic regarding Project Nantes.  We had a detailed briefing.  This follows on from the letter from NAMA, No. 1761, which we published last December.  Essentially, the parliamentary legal advisor advised us that she agrees with the interpretation of section 172, as outlined in the NAMA letter before Christmas.  We received a detailed briefing but that is strictly privileged so I am not in a position to publish or distribute that.<\/p><p>A clear distinction was made between when NAMA sells property over which it has a charge and when it can separately sell a loan or a loan book.  The parliamentary legal advisor said section 172 applies to where NAMA sells a property over which it  has a charge but does not apply in respect of a loan sale.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to correct me if I say anything wrong on this because he is familiar with this issue.  A section 172 declaration is not required in respect of a loan sale even though NAMA has been seeking one in many situations.  It was not legally required, however.  It was probably an extra element of assurance for NAMA but it was not legally required.  It is another day's work but not for this committee.  The legislation did not specifically deal with the sale of loans.  Only the sale of property was dealt with when the NAMA legislation was being established, all of ten years ago.  The legal advice to us stated a director of a company that was involved in purchasing a property or even a loan book from NAMA is not necessarily a connected person.  A person is only a connected person under the strict criteria laid down in the Act.  In layman's English, that is if one is an associated debtor, or if the organisation buying is a corporate body, a subsidiary or a related company, or if the person is a nominee of the debtor.  A director of a company can be a director of a company that is involved in these transactions that may not be a nominee of the original debtor.  There was a presumption because a director was involved in this that it was in contravention of the NAMA legislation.  NAMA is satisfied it was not and the parliamentary legal advisor has confirmed that view to us today.  I am just putting this on the public record because many people have been asking us for the up-to-date position on it.  This committee accepts the position as set out by NAMA and as now confirmed by the OPLA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"2017 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts (Resumed)<br \/>Vote 3 - Office of the Attorney General<br \/>Vote 5 - Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions<br \/>Vote 6 - Office of the Chief State Solicitor","time":1549530000,"counter":718,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#KK00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549530000,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Mr. Damien Moloney(Director General, Office of the Attorney General), Ms Maria Browne(Chief State Solicitor, Office of the Chief State Solicitor), and Mr. Barry Donoghue(Deputy Director, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions) called and examined.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":720,"content":"<p>We shall now move on to the afternoon business.

The 2017 Appropriation Account for Vote 3 - Office of the Attorney General shows gross expenditure of just over &euro;14.5 million in respect of the programme for the provision of legal advice to the Government, Departments and offices, and for legislative drafting services.  The expenditure included Exchequer funding of &euro;2.2 million for the Law Reform Commission, LRC.  Appropriations-in-aid totalled &euro;668,000 for the year, almost all of which related to retained pension-related deductions from staff salaries.

This office does not charge for its services. <br\/><br\/>The 2017 Appropriation Account for the office's Vote records gross expenditure of &euro;33.1 million.  This mainly comprised administration costs of &euro;18.3 million and payments of fees to counsel totalling &euro;13.6 million.  Appropriations-in-aid totalled &euro;1.1 million.  The surplus for surrender at the year's end was &euro;349,000. <br\/><br\/>At the end of 2017, the accumulated value of taxed costs awarded to the State but not yet recovered totalled &euro;9.6 million.  This was marginally up on the comparable position in 2016.  Receipts in 2017 totalled &euro;397,000, representing only about 4% of the 2017 year-end figure. <br\/><br\/>In my report on the Appropriation Account for Vote 6, I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with EU and national procurement rules in respect of contracts operated by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in 2017.

Fees paid to counsel retained by the director totalled &euro;16.4 million in 2017.  The original voted provision for this area of spending was &euro;14.5 million.  The additional expenditure of &euro;1.9 million was attributed to a greater than expected level of activity in certain courts.  To accommodate the additional spending on fees, a Supplementary Estimate was voted.  This allocated expected savings on other subheads to meet the additional fees, and increased the resources available to the director by a net &euro;418,000.  At the year end, the net outturn on the Vote was a surplus of just under &euro;190,000, which was due for surrender to the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#KK00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549530000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>On the Chairman's point about four offices and one body with three Accounting Officer Votes, I apologise for the structure.  The Attorney General's Office has three of those constituent offices but has two Accounting Officers.  I hope that will all become apparent in the opening statements.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee for the invitation to discuss the 2017 Appropriation Account of the Office of the Attorney General and the 2017 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am pleased to report that the office did not feature in the annual report.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Lynda O'Regan and Mr. David Donnelly.<\/p> <p>  I will commence by touching on the work of the Office of the Attorney General.  Our primary function is to support the Attorney General in discharging his functions as legal adviser to the Government.  In that regard, the office provides two main services to our clients - legal advice and legislative drafting.  The scope and variety of the legal work is broad, with new areas of work being added continuously.<\/p><p>The advisory section of the office is organised into five specialist groups covering all major legal specialisms.  This set-up allows the members of the group to become expert in the areas to which they are assigned and to provide a high level of expertise to clients.  To develop the expertise of the legal advisory staff further and to encourage close collaboration with Departments, the office has been running a secondment programme since 2006 whereby advisory counsel from the office are recruited and placed as legal advisers within Departments.  At the end of 2017, the office had 24 legal advisers seconded across 14 Departments and offices.  The office also assigns an advisory counsel as legal counsellor to the permanent representative in Brussels.  In March 2017, a second advisory counsel was seconded to the permanent representative to deal with Brexit in particular.  The office had two advisory counsel working as seconded national experts in the European Commission and another in the European Parliament.<\/p><p> The legislative drafting service is provided through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  That is a constituent office, organised into four groups, each serving a number of specific Departments.  This enables the drafters to build up a high level of familiarity with the work of the client Department, which in turn facilitates drafting on complex topics.  Much of the work of the office, particularly the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, is primarily driven by the Government's legislative programme.  Both the advisory and drafting sides of the office hold meetings and are in regular contact with client Departments to allow for ongoing review of the services being provided.<\/p><p> The administration side of the office provides administrative support to both the advisory and drafting sides.  It is organised into a number of business units covering human resources, finance, library and knowledge management, information technology, change management, training and development, corporate services and registry.  Senior management from the administration side participates in the office's management committee, currently called the management committee and previously a management advisory committee.  There is also a joint Chief State Solicitor's office-Attorney General's office management committee, which meets less frequently but acts as an umbrella for the constituent offices.<\/p><p> The office constantly re-assesses the need to provide legal services to its wide range of clients and so seeks to ensure that its lawyers are fully trained and resourced.  This involves making sure that legal staff are fully expert in their areas of legal work and have at their disposal all resources to do their work to the highest standard required by Government.  Knowledge management and information sharing is a central feature of how we operate.  Precedents, procedures and practices are recorded and made available as appropriate to staff.<\/p><p> With regard to the 2017 appropriation account, the office operated an administrative gross budget of &euro;15.66 million of which the outturn was &euro;14.54 million.  A significant proportion, &euro;11.26 million, close to 72%, of our budget was allocated to salaries.  This high proportion reflects the fact that the office is a legal professional organisation providing legal services to the Government and Departments and does not have expenditure programmes as such.  The next largest allocation is the &euro;2.24 million, 14.3% of our budget, for the Law Reform Commission, the sole office under our aegis.  That money is channelled through our Vote as a grant-in-aid.  The remaining &euro;2.16 million, 14% of the budget, is allocated to training, IT, premises, telecoms and so on.  During 2017, the office had savings in excess of &euro;1 million.  The majority of that excess, approximately &euro;800,000, arose in subhead A1, salaries.  Some &euro;156,000 arose in A2, due to reduced dependence on contract legal expertise.  Some &euro;52,000 was from our subhead concerning the Law Reform Commission.<\/p><p> The savings in salaries arose due to delays in the planned filling of vacancies due to the lack of availability of panels and security vetting.  The savings in A2 arose due to lesser reliance on contract drafting expertise from outside the office.  The savings on the Law Reform Commission were due mainly to staff changes.  In all areas of expenditure, the office closely monitors and controls expenditure to ensure appropriate use of funds and maximum value.  Each month, the office's management committee is briefed on the office's financial position including such issues as the formulation of annual budgets and measures required to meet savings or staffing targets imposed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> The office operates a financial management system which greatly assists me and also informs the monthly presentation on financial matters to the members of management committee.  There is ongoing development of an interface with the financial management system and the case records management system, ACME, to allow for the development of costing as well as enhanced financial and non-financial management reports.<\/p><p> The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office has a separate Accounting Officer but we work closely with it through our constituent office of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  We have a joint Attorney General's office-Chief State Solicitor's office management advisory committee which meets a number of times throughout the year.  In addition, we share a number of IT systems and knowledge management initiatives to ensure efficiencies and expertise are shared.  In conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office, the office has an audit committee which includes three external members, one of whom acts as chair.  Each year, the committee agrees a programme of audits and the resulting reports and recommendations are presented to the local management committees and made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p> The committee will be aware of the Government's extensive legislative programme which places heavy demands on the office, both in the formulation of advice on legislative provisions as well as their actual drafting.  The increasing pace in the delivery of Government services means that much of the advice has to be provided and the drafting carried out in a way that meets that increasing pace, at relatively short notice.  There is an increasing demand for advisory and drafting services.  Government amendments should be pointed out specifically.  Almost 300 Private Member's Bills have been introduced since 2016.  The nature of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union has yet to be determined.  However, Brexit has resulted in increased requests for advisory and drafting services, often at short notice.<\/p><p> The law is constantly changing, through case law, new legislation and the way it is interpreted or reinterpreted.  New developments of law emerge continually, including through the actions of the European Union and its Court of Justice as well as the European Court of Human Rights and changes in international law.  Our main challenge will be continuing to adapt to ensure we meet the demands of our clients, including Departments and the needs of the Government.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention.  If members have any questions, I am at their disposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#KK00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I ask for the opening statement from the Accounting Officer of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#LL00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549530000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend to assist the committee with its examination of the office's 2017 audited appropriation account, which was published by the Comptroller and Auditor General in September 2017.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Owen Wilson, assistant chief State solicitor, and Mr. Michael Fallon, head of corporate services.  I am pleased to be in a position to say that my office does not feature in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2017.  As requested, I have provided the committee with details of expenditure in 2017 and an update on expenditure in 2018.<\/p> <p>  As members will have seen from the briefing material, my office deals with a very wide range of legal work on behalf of the State.  The office is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and the legal services we provide range from litigation, to commercial, to advisory, to property and other transactional services.  The office has five legal divisions, each headed by an assistant chief State solicitor and organised by area of law, and a corporate services division.  Legal divisions are further organised into sections dealing with specific types of legal matters.  The corporate services division provides organisational and management services which support the legal work of the office.  The two main areas of spend for my office in 2017 were payroll and counsel fees.<\/p> <p>  Within the administration subheads, payroll is by far the largest expenditure at &euro;15.7 million in 2017.  This equates to 47.4% of the entire expenditure from the Vote for 2017.  The authorised staffing number for 2019 is 275 and we are in the process of filling a number of vacancies.  The ability to recruit in a timely manner and retain specialist staff, both legal and administrative, is an ongoing challenge.  Expenditure on the remaining administrative subheads, such as staff training and development, library and information services, knowledge management, utilities, building maintenance, photocopying and document preparation, telephone and postal services, and ICT facilities, amounted to &euro;2.6 million or 7.8% of total expenditure in 2017.<\/p> <p>  The provision of legal services is spread across five legal divisions, each headed by an assistant chief State solicitor, which is equivalent to assistant secretary.  These divisions are the administrative law division; the advisory, commercial and employment law division; the constitutional and State litigation division; the justice division; and the State property division.<\/p> <p>  With regard to challenges, we are a demand-led office and there is a direct and pronounced correlation between our clients' issues and the services we provide to them.  Aside from our transactional work, by and large it is difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty the exact scale and extent of litigation which may be taken against the State in any given year.<\/p><p>Some of the work can arise at very short notice and outside of normal office hours.  Specialist work requires the ongoing development and maintenance of the appropriate expertise, and the ability to respond to new developments in the law is a continuing requirement.<\/p><p> Expenditure on legal services includes counsel fees, general law expenses and external legal services, and accounted for 44.8% of overall expenditure in 2017.  The main area of expenditure under this heading is on fees paid to counsel, which in 2017 accounted for 41% of the entire expenditure of the office.<\/p><p> The bulk of the expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any given time and so is always difficult to forecast accurately.  Recent years have seen an increase in the level of complexity of the work being handled by the office in areas such as judicial review, immigration and asylum law, environmental law, and commercial and EU litigation, and this has resulted in increased spend on counsel, including senior counsel.  The management of expenditure on counsel fees is a key activity for my office, and there are significant controls in place to manage this expenditure.<\/p><p> In terms of oversight and risk, as my colleague mentioned, the office maintains an audit committee jointly with the Office of the Attorney General.  The committee includes three external representatives, all of whom, including the chair, are from the private sector.  It has been in place for a number of years and meets regularly.  Internal audit services are tendered externally and our current auditors were engaged following a joint Attorney General's office-Chief State Solicitor's office, AGO-CSSO, competitive tendering process in 2017.<\/p><p> The office maintains a risk register which is reviewed every six months.  Progress is monitored by the office's management board, together with a number of joint AGO-CSSO committees, including the risk management committee and the audit committee.<\/p><p> I will do my best to assist the committee in its consideration of the 2017 account for my office.  In the event that I do not have the information available to me here today, I will do my best to provide any outstanding material within two weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Browne.

I will highlight some points from the opening statement that might be of assistance to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The number of files received during the year 2017 was approximately 13,600, which was 500 up on the previous year, but I make the point that the sheer number of files coming into the office does not represent the extent of work required in those cases.  Particularly in the area of white-collar crime, there is a tendency for these files to be very large.  For example, I understand the data on our system for those files that we dealt with relating to the banking cases amounted to 388 GB.  I am not technically minded but those of the members who are technically minded will appreciate that amounts to a lot of data.  Some of these files can be very large.  That is also reflected in other areas.  For example, in murder cases, sometimes gangland cases, a very large amount of data comes into our office and has to be assessed and analysed.  That affects the amount of work that is required in those cases and affects the throughput.<\/p> <p>  Another factor I will highlight is that, as the Chief State Solicitor said, sometimes we are required to follow what others do.  The number of court cases and court sittings can affect the amount of work we do and the amount of fees paid.  There has been an increase, from four to six, in the number of judges sitting continually in the Central Criminal Court.  That increases the number of cases being processed by the courts and increases pressure on the fee area.  Similarly, since I last appeared before this committee, in 2015, there are now two Special Criminal Courts sitting simultaneously and that increases the number of cases being processed by that court and the fees payable.<\/p> <p>  Regarding developments since I last appeared before the committee, I will mention a number of issues.  First, on victims of crime, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 has been passed by the Oireachtas.  We set up a small unit in July 2015, called the victims liaison unit, to ensure that the office complies with its requirements relating to victims and their families.  That unit has been very proactive and has engaged with outside agencies, ensuring training and so forth for garda&iacute;.<\/p> <p>  We also receive, through that unit, requests from victims for reasons for decisions not to prosecute.  Looking at a three-year period from 2016 to 2018, we received approximately 1,800 requests for reasons from victims.  We also received requests for reviews of decisions because, under the victims directive and under the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, a victim is entitled to ask us to reconsider a decision not to prosecute.  Over that same period, we received 637 requests for reviews.  Approximately 40% of those cases relate to sexual offence complaints, and in a small number of cases we have reversed the decision not to prosecute and instituted a prosecution.  In terms of our requirements for victims' rights, this also has an effect on court processes.  We have to ensure that prosecutors, whether solicitors or counsel, are fully in a position to meet the requirements of victims under the directive.<\/p> <p>  The work of the office in the area of international matters falls into two parts.  The first is extradition, where we seek the return of someone from another country to stand trial in Ireland.  The second area relates to mutual assistance requests where we are looking for evidence in another country.  I mention in my opening statement that the area of mutual assistance has grown quite heavily, and over the period from 2015 to 2017, the number of requests for mutual assistance doubled.  That was largely driven by requests for information in the area of electronic evidence.  Many requests go to America seeking electronic evidence from the large service providers there.<\/p> <p>  As part of the response to the banking crisis, we established a small special financial unit which dealt with all the banking cases over the years.  Since the conclusion of those cases, the unit still operates and deals with other white-collar crime cases in close liaison with the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.<\/p> <p>  In my opening statement, I mentioned issues to do with information and communications technology.  I will highlight two of those.  In some of those, we are proactively involved with others in the area, which is obviously very important in the modern world.  One of the matters which we piloted is the electronic transmission of disclosure material to both prosecution counsel and defence solicitors.  The Chairman and committee may be aware that in prosecution cases an important part of the work is to ensure there is disclosure to the defence on matters which may assist to undermine the prosecution case or enhance the defence case.  A lot of that material can be quite sensitive and we have put in place a secure electronic transfer system with defence solicitors and counsel.  That is operating at present in the Central Criminal Court and will be extended into the Circuit Court later this year.<\/p> <p>  We are also heavily involved, through Ms Helena Kiely, in the so-called criminal justice operational hub, which is a very important project from the point of view of the criminal justice system generally.  It will allow data to be shared from the beginning of a case right through, from the Garda to ourselves, to the courts system, to the probation service and prison service.  In due course it will be able to produce statistics, which is a problem in the criminal justice area because everybody assesses cases on a different basis, which means statistics do not match from one agency to another.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the expenditure for 2017, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, the largest area of cost is fees to counsel, which came to &euro;16.4 million.  As I stated, that is largely driven by the number of trials which are set by the courts.  Any increase in business will affect the amount of fees paid to counsel.  Extra sittings of the Central Criminal Court and of the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, which have happened, and the new Court of Appeal are all matters which generate further court work and extra pressure on the fees side.<\/p> <p>  I will end with two issues that are challenges for the future.  The obvious one is Brexit in terms of the criminal justice system.  From our point of view, we are working with the Department of Justice and Equality in terms of contingency measures.  We are involved in two groups looking at mutual assistance, extradition and data protection.  On extradition, at some point at the end of March, it seems that we will be working under a different system with the United Kingdom.  Most of our extradition arrangements are with it.  We have been working with the people there on the basis of the European arrest warrant, which is a slimmed down version of extradition which works quite well.  We will have to move into another area, which will be challenging.<\/p> <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is a very important part of Government policy.  One aspect of that commission's report referred to the role of garda&iacute; in terms of prosecution work.  The Chairman may be aware that the Garda has a heavy role in prosecution work.  In most cases in the District Court outside Dublin and in Dublin, the Garda decides whether there should be a prosecution and conducts that prosecution.  It is an unusual model from that point of view.  The issue was looked at 20 years ago or so by the Nally group, which did not recommend any change.  If we were to move away from the present system where the Garda essentially prosecutes cases in court, there would need to be an important analysis of what that would involve.  It seems to me a considerable cost would be involved in replacing inspectors and superintendents in courts with lawyers.<\/p><p>That is something that I think we will be working on with the Department of Justice and Equality and Garda, in terms of working out some method to see how that recommendation can be implemented.  I think that is going to be an important challenge for the prosecution service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donoghue.

The structures have changed in response to where we are.  The structures do not necessarily anticipate political decisions made by the electorate or elsewhere but the structures have changed.  In a manner of speaking, we have become more responsive to the needs of Government in terms of drafting Committee Stage amendments to a greater number of Private Members' Bills.  We obviously do not do so for all 300 because the system would have ground to a halt had we been doing so, but we do it for the amendments to Bills the Government shows an active interest in, which is a smaller subset.  The structures have changed in the sense that the public law expertise used to just vest in the Office of the Attorney General.  To the extent that the Attorney General offers any assistance or support to the Oireachtas, it was that every Government Bill that arrived on the floor of the Houses of the Oireachtas, was accompanied by a warranty from the Attorney General of the day that the Bill was constitutional and legally sound.  Clearly, if there are many Private Members' Bills, an equivalent is needed to make that operable on the side of the Oireachtas, and while the Attorney General supports the Oireachtas in that respect, he is the adviser to the Government.  The structural changes have been around the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, the elevation in the rank of the legal adviser, the increasing of the numbers of staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and the creating of the public law expertise.  I have a very good working relationship with the parliamentary legal adviser and that is important.  It is important to both branches of Government to make sure that in a co-operative sense, the public law expertise the State has is shared in an equitable way, so that the State does not find itself funding two separate services that do not co-operate where it is possible for them to co-operate.<\/p><p>I could answer further but I do not want to take up all of the Deputy's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#OO03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Moloney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":795,"content":"<p>That is fine.

It might be of interest to the committee that when this was looked at 20 years or so ago by the Nally group, it said 400 more lawyers would be needed to replace garda&iacute; in the courts, so it does not come at no cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#TT01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>The reason I hone in on this is that at a previous Committee of Public Accounts meeting - it might have been with the Department of Justice and Equality on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote - we remarked that, say, an inspector could in any district have 40 cases a day before him and have ten private solicitors.  I think we understood that that inspector gets an additional allowance of something like &euro;5,000 a year for doing court prosecutions.  The Committee of Public Accounts members on the day were amazed by the outstanding value for money.  We felt that if those thousands of cases that are dealt with for a minimal cost of &euro;5,000 per prosecuting inspector, as the case may be, in a number of courts around the country, they would cost multiples of multiples of that if there were to be a State agency or legal people doing the prosecution.  In all my time here it seemed the best value for money the State had achieved in anything.  From the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts, then, we would want a costing on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#TT01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549530000,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019020700002#TT02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1549530000,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>It is a beautiful proposal to free up the garda&iacute; from going into court to do prosecutions, but I think the costs to the State could be phenomenal if we were to replace the current system.

At the time, we had an effective force of 2,049 members, or exactly 50% of the Reserve&rsquo;s total establishment, and we were facing some serious problems.  Recruitment had stagnated; with 2,020 places to fill, we had taken in only 471 new recruits in the preceding four years.  Retirements due to age and natural wastage were outstripping the Reserve's ability to replace these losses.  This was not down to a lack of interest from potential applicants as during that four-year period, more than 10,000 people had applied to join the Reserve, but was rather down to the Defence Forces' inability to give sufficient attention to reserve recruiting.  Lengthy delays, frequent cancellations of testing events, and generally <i>ad hoc <\/i>arrangements resulted in large numbers of applicants losing interest during a frustratingly drawn-out process.  By the end of each recruiting campaign, only a handful of dedicated applicants remained to be enlisted on each occasion.<br\/><br\/>We were also facing other issues that came under the remit of the military authorities relating to the maintenance of personal protective equipment or the timely processing of payment to members of the Reserve for periods of paid training, all of which were raised during our committee appearance.  Meanwhile, we discussed issues that fell under the remit of the Department of Defence, namely, its levels of engagement with RDFRA and urgently required initiatives that would require the approval of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  In brief, early 2017 was not a good time for the Reserve.<br\/><br\/>Two years on, we are now very grateful for the opportunity to report on the current status of the Reserve to the committee and inform it of the outcomes of our previous appearance.  While the effective strength of the Reserve continued to drop in 2017 and early 2018 to an all-time low of 1,653 members in quarter one of last year, by January 2019 it had risen slightly to 1,840 effective members, the highest figure in two years.  In 2018, the Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, also revived the office of director with responsibility for the Reserve, which was previously disbanded in 2013, and so the Reserve now once again has a single senior officer whose responsibility it is to grow and develop the force.  Since its inception, the two directors who have inhabited the role, Colonel Brian Cleary and the current incumbent, Colonel Ger Buckley, have initiated training courses that will see the commissioning of new Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve officers in the near future; these new leaders are vital to the future of the organisation.  The director's office also streamlined the mechanism by which reservists' pay is processed and is actively seeking to get promotion competitions back on track for all ranks.<br\/><br\/>Make no mistake, there is still more that the military authorities can do to improve the situation for the Reserve.  There is an ongoing eyesight standard anomaly that exists in the Naval Service Reserve, whereby an applicant for the Naval Service Reserve can be rejected on eyesight grounds but that same person can then apply for and successfully join the Permanent Defence Force Naval Service.  The permanent force will accept candidates of varying eyesight standards but the Naval Service Reserve is only permitted to recruit those with 20-20 vision.  It must be noted that this committee raised this matter directly with the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence when he appeared before this committee on 26 April 2018 and the Minister of State replied that the eyesight standards were &quot;currently being changed&quot;.  That was ten months ago.  However, the RDFRA is aware of an initiative by the military authorities to update the Naval Service eyesight standards in line with international maritime standards; the RDFRA sincerely hopes that these changes will come into force in the very near future.  The Reserve will be recruiting again on 1 April 2019 and so time is of the essence.  If the eyesight standards are not updated by then, many more Naval Service Reserve applicants will be turned away unnecessarily.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, with another reserve recruitment competition looming, the RDFRA is hopeful that a new reserve recruitment model that has been developed at the request of the director with responsibility for the Reserve &ndash; a recruitment model that was designed by reservists for reservists and that empowers reservists to manage their own recruitment insofar as is possible &ndash; will be implemented in time for the next recruitment competition, which begins in seven weeks.  If this is not introduced in time, it will be a lost opportunity to maximise our potential recruit numbers from this competition and the Reserve will again suffer needlessly as a result.<br\/><br\/>To sum up on the RDFRA's engagement with the military authorities in recent years, they listened to our 2017 submission to this committee and took serious steps to remedy the issues identified.  There is certainly a lot more work to do but the RDFRA wishes to genuinely acknowledge and thank the Chief of Staff, the assistant chief of staff, Brigadier General Peter O&rsquo;Halloran, and the military authorities for the steps that they have taken to help save the Reserve.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, the Department of Defence&rsquo;s attitude towards engagement with the RDFRA has been somewhat more aloof.  Two years ago we reiterated the critical need to amend and update Defence Forces Regulation R5, which governs most aspects of the Reserve&rsquo;s existence, and Defence Forces Regulation S7, which governs our representative association.  The Reserve was reorganised in 2013 and new versions of both regulations should have been implemented at that time to reflect the new organisational structures.  It is simply beyond belief that new regulations have not been implemented some six years later, despite repeated and consistent efforts on our part to obtain updates from the Department.  We have offered our assistance in drafting the regulations in order to support the Department.  To date, the Department of Defence has continuously informed us that updated draft versions of both regulations are currently being developed.  However, the RDFRA has been prevented from seeing these drafts, which effectively prohibits the association from having any input into these documents.  This is an untenable position for the Department to adopt since we and our members will be the end users of this product.  Similarly, there has been no movement whatsoever on any of the Reserve-specific White Paper projects announced in that document as far back as 2015.<br\/><br\/>The most serious new issue involving the Department of Defence and the Reserve is the pay discrepancy that the Department of Defence has allowed to form between the Permanent Defence Force and Reserve Defence Force rates of pay.  In the first instance, it must be highlighted that the majority of a reservist's service is unpaid; the best part of training takes place in the evenings and at weekends.  However, reservists are entitled to payment when engaged in certain activities, such as full-time training courses.  This payment serves to offset the costs associated with a reservist&rsquo;s service in the Defence Forces, including those relating to mileage, time off work and ancillary expenses.  However, for the periods of paid training that reservists undertake, there is now a significant discrepancy between permanent and reserve rates of pay.<br\/><br\/>Reserve pay is tied to Permanent Defence Force pay rates by two ministerial Defence Forces regulations, R5 and S3.  These clarify that reservists are entitled to be paid at the lowest point of the Permanent Defence Force pay scale for their particular rank.  However, the vast majority of reservists are currently paid 18% less than the corresponding lowest point on the current Permanent Defence Force pay scale for each rank.<\/p><p>This is particularly enraging for reservists.  Not only did we suffer a pay reduction at rates variable by rank in 2009, reservists received an additional 10% blanket pay reduction in 2013.  The Reserve pay rate has, in essence, been plundered twice and we are not even on a par with the lowest points on the Permanent Defence Forces' payscale.  This has significant impacts for our existing members in terms of the costs associated with their continued and loyal service.  It also represents an obstacle to attracting new members, particularly among young people who may not be in employment and who are not in a position to foot the costs associated with serving in the Reserve.  RDFRA notified the Department of this breach of regulations last December and while we recognise that it is a complex issue, we have not been given an explanation, a plan to settle the arrears or an expected time to resolution.  Our members are deeply frustrated by these delays in taking effective action and rightly question whether a similar attitude would be experienced were the underpayment to have been made to our comrades in the Permanent Defence Forces.  The Reserve pay rates need to be realigned with their permanent counterparts immediately.  However, RDFRA has serious concerns that such a pay rate realignment could take months or even years for the Department to implement, to say nothing of the payment of arrears.<\/p><p> Currently, it is RDFRA's view that the association's and our members' experiences are just one part of a wider malaise affecting defence in Ireland at present, involving the Department of Defence, the military authorities, our colleagues in the Permanent Defence Forces and their two representative associations.  What is good for one element of the Defence Forces is necessarily good for all members of the Defence Forces, both Permanent and Reserve.  To truly improve the defence disposition in Ireland for both for the Permanent and Reserve Forces,  the committee should seek and establish a commission on the future of defence in Ireland in the spirit of the 2017-2018 Commission on the Future of Policing.  We also strongly urge the committee to extend invitations to the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association PDFORRA, and the Chief of Staff and the senior military authorities to appear before the committee and give their own views on defence in Ireland at present.  It is only by engaging with all stakeholders at this level that the damage done to both the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces be repaired.  Such actions are vital to the long-term growth and stability of the Defence Forces as a whole, and also to the continued security of the State.<\/p><p> I conclude with a brief statement on the value of the Reserve Defence Forces.  Taking the RDFRA national executive as an example of what the Reserve has to offer, we are all serving reservists &ndash; both Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve - ranging in rank from private to captain, from leading seaman to Naval Service Reserve lieutenant.  In our civilian capacities, we comprise a partner in a major Irish law firm and head of the construction law team for that firm, a trainee solicitor, a legal secretary, a cyber-security compliance specialist for a multinational telecommunications corporation, a vice-president of the trade union, F&oacute;rsa, a development manager for a food retail and wholesale company, a telecoms engineer, a PhD history student and a consultant at Blackrock Clinic who also serves as a professor at Trinity College Dublin.  That is just our national executive.  The Reserve is full of people just like us, yet we are not currently being utilised to the maximum benefit of the State.  Beyond the military authorities, there is generally no interest or willingness to engage with the concept of utilising the Reserve in a meaningful way.  Instead, there is a preference to limit the Reserve's access to resources, ignore our varied qualifications and skills sets, dismiss our calls for reform and generally display a hope that we will just fade away and that no one will notice.  Apathy is now one of the greatest threats faced by the Reserve.  Regardless of this, the dedicated remaining reservists are still committed to serving the State.<\/p><p> The Reserve must be meaningfully utilised in order to secure its future.  Utilisation provides a meaningful sense of reward.  It is a goal to work towards.  Perpetually training for training's sake is not enough.  With Brexit approaching and a hard border scenario a distinct possibility, the defence landscape in Ireland for the immediate future is somewhat uncertain.  The Defence Forces must be able to rely on all available personnel and assets should they be required in any contingent scenario.  Further, the support reservists could provide to overseas missions would be of great value to Irish missions abroad.  There are already small examples of the true value of Reserve utilisation displayed in pockets across the country, most notably in the areas of ICT and cyber, where reservists with specialist civilian IT qualifications have helped to revolutionise the technological and digital assets available to the Defence Forces.  This is just a drop in the ocean of what could be possible with greater Reserve utilisation.<\/p><p> As an achievable first step, a minor amendment to the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 would allow reservists to serve outside of the State in roles such as duties of a military representative, secondment to international organisations, conducting or participating in training, carrying out ceremonial duties, participating in exchanges or undertaking visits, undertaking monitoring, observation or advisory duties, participating in or undertaking reconnaissance or fact-finding missions, undertaking humanitarian tasks in response to an actual or potential disaster or emergency, participating in sporting events, or inspecting and evaluating stores, equipment and facilities.  It would allow the Reserve to take part in a wide range of valuable overseas roles short of deploying on UN missions, which is governed by the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 which we are not seeking to have amended at this time.  The Reserve could also engage in activities governed by the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 on the basis of individual reservists presenting themselves as available for service.  This would arguably remove the need for employment protection legislation to achieve this as these activities may be of short duration or may require only small numbers of reservists on each occasion.  In short, amending the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 would provide the vital basis for utilisation that the Reserve so desperately needs.<\/p><p> There also needs to be meaningful recognition of the qualifications and skills possessed by reservists so that, should the legislation be updated to permit proper Reserve utilisation, the individual reservist's qualifications will be fully acknowledged.  My colleague, Dr. Mathew McCauley, is an excellent example of a highly qualified reservist whose professional background has received a dearth of proportionate acknowledgment from the Defence Forces.  Having qualified 19 years ago, he has served as a consultant in international military healthcare systems for 13 years in the USA and UK.  A fellow of both the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland and the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK, he is also an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society.  A published expert in his field, he is a consultant at Blackrock Clinic and a professor at Trinity College Dublin.  Despite such experience and competence, Dr. McCauley was commissioned into the Reserve at the rank of second-lieutenant, the lowest commissioned rank.  Should he have joined the Permanent Defence Forces he would have been commissioned with at least the rank of captain, or two ranks higher than the one he currently holds.<\/p><p> The soldiers and sailors of the Reserve Defence Forces are clawing themselves back from the brink.  While the senior military authorities are doing what they can to help us, the extent of what they can do is being limited, to a significant degree, by factors outside of their control.  The Reserve is still in danger, and so we require committed political support at all levels to ensure our continued existence and future growth.  To summarise, our call to the committee is to consider our proposal to amend the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 in the light of all the positive changes that this would bring about to our Defence Forces.  I thank the committee and invite questions from the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549532700,"counter":1255,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Richardson for his comprehensive submission on the work of the Reserve Defence Forces and the potential for its involvement in a wider range of activities at home and abroad on behalf of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#J00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1549532700,"counter":1256,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Richardson for his contribution.  I note that there are a couple of positive developments since the last time the witnesses attended.  The main issue is around engagement with the Department of Defence.  I have a questions on the membership.  Mr. Richardson outlined the position regarding the national executive, but I wonder about the backgrounds of reservists generally.  In the forthcoming recruitment campaigns, who is it hoped will joint the Reserve?  Who will be targeted?  I refer to the time commitment of members of what is a reserve force.  I was struck by Mr. Richardson's point that reservists must be meaningfully utilised and his reference to the potential that exists.  If members are part of the Reserve, what are the practical issues as to how they can be employed more meaningfully given that they are in other full-time occupations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#J00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549532700,"counter":1257,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question on the target membership is a broad one because our membership demographic is as wide as the breadth of categories of people in the State.  We recruit students just out of secondary school all the way up to highly qualified specialists.  As such, it is hard to say specifically who we are recruiting.  Our target for the next recruitment intake will lean, however, towards specialists.  To give an example, the IT experts to whom I referred in my opening statement are people who work for international or multinational technology corporations like Intel, Google, Microsoft and Facebook.  That we can get these individuals to work within the Reserve Defence Forces for the Defence Forces on a predominantly free basis is a miracle.  They are willing to give their time for free to be a part of the military family and engage in that way.  While we will recruit anyone who is interested and while there are specialist and non-specialist roles across the Reserve Defence Forces, the next recruitment competition will probably lean toward getting specialists into key areas to help out.<\/p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on the time commitment.  Some people will be able to give more or less time.  The proposed amendment to the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 would allow a Reserve team to go to the UK or the Continent to help with training activities for a week or two.  Reservists commit regularly to training periods of that length within the State.  As such, this dovetails with the leave people take from work.  For short deployments, employment protection legislation would not be required to apply as it would be simple enough for people to meet the time commitment involved from current set ups.<\/p><p>We can be used meaningfully for short durations; that would sit very well with the Reserve Defence Forces set-up.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549532700,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations; they were very comprehensive and provided some valuable policy ideas and initiatives, which are always welcome.  There seems to be a mismatch in the language used.  The Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association, RDFRA, has obviously had a very positive engagement with military authorities, which is supportive of the work it does and is committed on an ongoing basis to supporting that work.  The Department of Defence has used words such as \"apathy\" and \"aloof\" to describe a general disengagement.  There is a lack of response to submissions made around regulations, for example.  How can that be improved?  Who is the RDFRA's point of engagement in the Department?  Is it a ministerial matter or is it a matter for officials?  Where is the direct line of engagement?  If this committee is to support the work of the RDFRA we need to know where the issue lies within the Department of Defence.  There is a clear split in the language used by both bodies, and if the RDFRA is to be supported it is important that we address those issues.<\/p> <p>  The last time the RDFRA was here the serious difficulty it was experiencing in terms of numbers was highlighted, as was the mismatch between the White Paper target and the actual numbers in the Reserve.  That number has stabilised, but it has not improved.  The witnesses have provided some policy ideas in that area.  When do they think we will reach a point where we will see proper growth in the numbers?  What can stimulate that?  Certain things have been mentioned, but if we are to value the organisation this information is important.  <\/p> <p>  As part of the White Paper there have been some reforms in recent years.  Some people within the military with whom I have discussed the reforms have said there has been a destructive policy in parts of Ireland where there was a localised system of recruitment.  That has now been diminished by the centralising reform which has occurred.  Is there anything that can be changed in that area so that we can see an improvement in recruitment of Reserve members across all counties?  Are the witnesses seeing a geographical disparity in the people who are applying and who are actually becoming reservists?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#K00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549532700,"counter":1260,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions the Deputy asked on our contact with the Department and will pass the questions on recruitment to my colleague, Mr. Scanlon.<\/p> <p>  We predominantly deal with the Defence Forces personnel policy branch; it is our main point of contact within the Department.  We encounter issues around asking questions about and accessing documents which are relevant to us and which we know are circulating.  We are regularly told that it is an inappropriate time to pass on these documents.  We understand that there is background policy work which might have to be done before it is ready to be shown to a representative associations, but this happens so consistently and regularly that it is problematic for us.

If a member meets someone who is interested in the Reserve he or she can tell that person when to look out for recruitment campaigns.  We are trying to time those campaigns so that the processing, which involves security clearance, fitness tests and medicals, would all be ready for periods such as the academic holiday year, because, to return to the point made by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, one of the demographics we are targeting are those leaving secondary school and going to third level.  Those people have time on their hands, and are the type of people who can give a good commitment to the Reserve as they are young and fit.  We have to lower our age profile, because we are coming out of a period when recruitment was embargoed for several years.  We then moved again to recruitment, but the model in place was not fit for purpose.  We have high hopes for the next recruitment competition, because many of what we saw as the flaws in that model have been tweaked.  Hopefully the improvements since then, including the shortening of time required for security clearance, among other things, will bear fruit.  We are trying to achieve consistency and certainty.<\/p> <p>  The demographics issue was raised.  It is certainly easier to recruit people in the areas around occupied military barracks.

It is.  The problem is that our members are not being facilitated to use the paid training and to use that budget.

At the moment there is a control measure at 28 days.  When a person hits 28 days he or she has to apply for more, and they have to be pre-approved by the Department.  It committed, around a year and a half ago, to increasing that number to 42.  It is still a control measure, but would provide a little bit more paid training for the Reserve per year.  As far as we are aware that has still not been implemented, so the Reserve will still hit that ceiling.

I used to be a member of the Forsa Cosanta &Aacute;itiuil, FCA, when I was a young man, and I am interested in what the correspondence is between the FCA and the Reserve in terms of numbers.  Almost every town had an FCA group when I was growing up, and I know that the group the witnesses represent is a much tighter organisation.  <br\/><br\/>What is the profile of members in general?  There are obviously some highly qualified people in the ranks of the Reserve, and I suspect those mentioned in the presentation are all officer class; perhaps I am wrong about that.  What is the profile of the typical man or woman in the Reserve?  Is he or she employed, unemployed, self-employed or farming?  What is the gender balance?  What is the retirement age for the Reserve?  Is it the same as the regular army or is there a difference?  <br\/><br\/>We have been asked to look into the possibility of establishing a commission, such as the commission on policing.  Is that an initiative of the RDFRA?  Has it talked this out with the regular Defence Forces?  Is there cross-rank support on this or is it an initiative of the RDFRA management association?  <br\/><br\/>It is great that people are willing to put their personal time and efforts into being part of the Reserve Defence Forces, serving both land and sea.  It is an act of patriotism, and it should be encouraged as very good training for people as well.

It affected the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>  We have a doctor in the Reserve Defence Forces.  He joined the Defence Forces as a direct entry doctor.  He was recruited because they needed someone to go to Africa at the time.  They did not have enough doctors on staff.  He was brought in and given a conversion course and was sent to Africa.  It was a serious mission and when he finished his six-month deployment, they asked him if he would be interested in staying on as a reservist and he agreed.  They reduced his rank from commandant to lieutenant and put him into the Reserve.  The week before he had been the number one medical person in charge of 500 or 600 people.  If something went wrong - there were tropical diseases, people could have a gunshot wound or whatever - he was the person on point and everybody trusted him to do that job.

They really do not want to use them.<\/p> <p>  The only people who can change that are the people in this building.  The Department will say it is in the Act and there is nothing it can do about it.  We would like to change this so that the Chief of Staff has a bigger pick.  He can decide not to use the Reserve or to use it.  As it stands today, he has no choice.  He does not have the pick of the Reserve if he wants to use it, except by contorting the regulations in order to do so.  We are asking the legislators to look at our proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#L02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Scanlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1549532700,"counter":1285,"content":"<p>I apologise but I have to leave.

I am very interested in how we can help to encourage that interest.  Are we asking too much of people?  Are we expecting too much of those who are recruited?

Unfortunately, Reserve recruitment is particularly <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  I will describe what happens to individuals like those mentioned.  The closing date for the competition passes and the majority of applicants are contacted for the first time two months later.  That is unusual and not great.  It is a little sloppy.  They are then called for a fitness test which is their first exposure to Defence Forces recruitment testing procedures.  It could be another six or seven weeks later and the date might be changed at short notice.  As a result, people start to get browned off.  Those who make it through that stage come back for a medical examination which is arranged exclusively during normal working hours.  Some may be asked just one day before to come into a barracks at 10 a.m.If they say no because they are in work, tough and away they go.  The pool gets smaller and smaller because of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>and very  poorly organised competition.  The small number at the very end consists of the dedicated ones who have stuck it out through the process.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Scanlon and I have trialled new recruitment methods in our own units, at the Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh or, in Mr. Scanlon's case, throughout the country on behalf of the Naval Service.  We took our recruits from the closing date of the competition to induction, when they begin training.  Last year my unit did it in nine weeks, while Mr. Scanlon's did it in eight.  We found that if the testing stages could be organised rapidly in a formally correct way, the tempo would be kept up and people's interest maintained.  That is reflected in the numbers brought into training at the very end.  While my recruits from the 2018 competition were in training last year, other units throughout the country were training recruits from the 2017 competition.  It took them nearly 18 months to achieve what Mr. Scanlon and I had managed to achieve in a matter of weeks.  We developed the recruitment proposal to which I referred in my opening statement which is with the director of Reserve forces to formally structure the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, recruitment process each year in order that it would not be <i>ad hoc <\/i>and merely utilised whenever there was a gap in the timeline.  We are very hopeful it will be implemented and in force by 1 April, when the new recruitment window opens.  Otherwise the applicants who will apply online in April may not be sworn in until 2020, which is unnecessary.  That is what causes the drop-off.  Understandably, people become frustrated at the process.  They have other time-related commitments and there are voluntary organisations that will take them in far more quickly than the Reserve.  I call on the committee to support the proposal which is to make sure this formal and structured recruitment process would be implemented.  It could be achieved and we would have good numbers once it was done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549532700,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>I do not want to take too much credit for the speed at which the Naval Service's personnel were inducted.  Personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, particularly Lieutenant Stephen Stack, put a lot of effort into making sure the process was streamlined and very quick.  I would like to point to the one thing that caused all of our numbers to fall below Mr. Richardson's.  It is the anomalous eyesight standard for the Naval Service Reserve, NSR, as mentioned in the opening statement.  It results in the loss of about 45% of suitable applicants.  If Mr. Richardson takes in 100 people who finish the process, he might get 90 of them.  He can expect ten to go down on medical grounds.  We would lose 45 on medical grounds, mostly due to the eyesight standard.  It is not fit for purpose.  There is a case to be made in favour of changing it, but it is moving very slowly through the bureaucratic process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Scanlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549532700,"counter":1290,"content":"<p>The points raised are related to recruitment, retention and terms and conditions of service.  I can develop what has been said about the specialist side of the RDF.  Comments I make are solely in my role as a member of the national executive of the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, not in any official capacity in representing the medical corps.  <\/p> <p>  Some of the points raised alluded to the fact that section 7.2 of the 2015 White Paper on Defence specifically highlighted the utilisation of RDF specialist members in cases where the relevant skill was not retained in the Permanent Defence Force, PDF.  It is four years since the Department was tasked with developing recruitment and utilisation policies for this group within the Defence Forces.  Despite support from the military healthcare authorities and their encouragement of the single force concept, it has not really come to fruition during that time.<\/p> <p>  If the Chairman allows me a moment or two, I will elaborate on a few of the key issues.  The context is the 2012 Defence Forces reorganisation which saw the number of Reserve personnel in the medical field reduced from 213 to 35, an 84% reduction.  The number who are filling permanent duty stations, PDS, is around 37%.  I understand there are about three clinical medical corps officers left.  This has had huge implications, on which my colleague has elaborated.  The use of those clinical medical corps officers is restricted to the direct provision of clinical care for Defence Forces personnel, partly owing to the rank they hold and where they sit within the organisation, despite often being consultant-level clinicians in their civilian careers.  This compares shockingly with the position in other jurisdictions.  For example, 60% of the US army's medical assets sit in the US army reserve.  Some ten of the United Kingdom's multidisciplinary comprehensive field hospitals sit in the reserve.  As to why that might be the case, the RDFRA has been notified through representations of our members in the medical field that there has been no overt or strategic recruitment campaign for medical professionals.  There are no opportunities for military personnel to engage in direct clinical provision.  There are no opportunities to engage in specialist activities outside the State.  There are limited career opportunities once someone is in the system.  There are insufficient numbers of RDF medical personnel to engage in RDF medical exercises.  My colleague has alluded to the lack of reciprocity between RDF and PDF medical corps officers.  Through discussions and liaison with medial corps RDFRA members, we can attest to a view that is increasingly held that this is unsustainable, despite the support from military healthcare authorities.  It is also in spite of the fact that it has been ten years since publication of the PA Consulting report on the future of Defence Forces medical services, seven years since the Defence Forces reorganisation and four years since the publication of the White Paper on Defence.  We all agree that the strength, skills mix and use of Reserve assets in the medical field are totally within the remit of the military authorities and we are not trying to step into that domain.  However, from our discussions, there is increasingly a view that if there were proper investment and recruitment, we might see PDF medical assets more fully augmented by RDF assets; an expansion of the breadth and depth of Defence Forces medical capabilities; and an ability to deliver a full spectrum military medical operational care pathway, as seen in other jurisdictions.  PDF medical personnel could be augmented in engaging in medical and domestic military clinical activities, which would also be an opportunity to enhance the Defence Forces' overall medical resources.  <\/p> <p>  While there are these difficulties, the colleagues who have come to RDFRA with these representations are loyal, dutiful and committed members of the Defence Forces.  They believe it is an honour to serve in the RDF.  Their only objective is to see its medical cadre thrive.  Despite the support we are getting from the military medical authorities, the problem persists.<\/p><p>Collectively, we see the need for change and investment but, as already stated, with policies in R5 and so forth, we feel political support needs to be applied in order to see some change in light of the years and years of challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mathew McCauley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549532700,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Holohan, Mr. Scanlon, Mr. Richardson and Dr. McCauley for their presentation.  Dr. McCauley asked about political support.  He knows that he has it from this committee.  This is the second time in two years that representatives of the Reserve Defence Force have had an opportunity to make a presentation to the committee, which I do not think happened previously.  Deputy Lisa Chambers - the main Opposition party spokesperson on defence - Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, Deputy Barrett and the other members of the committee will pursue these issues with the Minister.  We recognise their importance.  We have had the Chief of Staff before the committee.  It was the first occasion on which he had made a presentation to an Oireachtas committee.  We have had ongoing engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and we will have him before this committee again to discuss the White Paper.  We will take that opportunity to raise some of these issues.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned to our guests previously that I am very conscious of the very important role of the Reserve Defence Force and its predecessor, the FCA, over the years.  I often mention this in discussions on defence-related issues, be they Estimates or other aspects of the Defence Forces' and the Department's work.  I have had the privilege of representing over a considerable period two Border counties.  I grew up in a Border community.  I witnessed the thuggery and violence and the loss of life that resulted from paramilitary activities.  The very important role of the Reserve Defence Force during those years is unsung and not recognised enough.  In addition, the Reserve Defence Force was a very good training ground for young people who may have been vulnerable at the time.  I know many members of the FCA, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and members of the Permanent Defence Force who at times identified young people who may have been vulnerable, who may not have completed their education or who were not in employment, and they ensured that they became members of the FCA.  Many of them progressed to be members of the Permanent Defence Force and have served our country with great distinction and great commitment.<\/p> <p>  Over the years, the Reserve Defence Force and the FCA have been a very valuable progression route to recruit people into the Permanent Defence Force.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and his Department officials tell us there is a problem getting people recruited into the Permanent Defence Force.  I do not think enough is being done to use the Reserve Defence Force as a pathway to a career in the Permanent Defence Force, which is very important.  It was farcical that recruitment for a particular year was announced in or around August.  I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and his officials, why we do not target colleges of further education, where in many instances there are security courses and other courses that would appear to have the profile of young women and men who would be suitable for the Reserve Defence Force.  There are plenty of recruitment avenues to explore but, as Deputy Barrett pointed out, the length of time the process takes is very frustrating.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers referred to the method of recruitment.  I think it is very important to have a localised element to it.  As I mentioned previously, the local knowledge and the interest of existing members of the Reserve Defence Force ensure that people who may not have been aware of the opportunity to join the Reserve Defence Force became aware of it through that local knowledge and local participation.  Some time ago, following the 2012 reorganisation of the Defence Forces, efforts were made to have further reorganisation of the training centres for our guests' organisation.  At the time it was proposed to close the centre in Cavan.  I objected very strongly to this.  It was proposed that the centre be amalgamated into the one in Dundalk, which would have been ludicrous.  Thankfully, the centre has remained in Cavan, covering Cavan, Longford, Leitrim and Monaghan.  I think that is the configuration.  It is very important there is a localised element to the recruitment and the training.<\/p> <p>  I wish to place on record again my appreciation and that of the committee of the work of the Reserve Defence Force over the years.  That work continues.  It is very heartening to hear how representative the Reserve Defence Force is of society in general.  Of course, we would like to see the potential of the contribution those members could make utilised to the full, and it is clear from Mr. Richardson's presentation that this is not happening.  I assure our guests that we will continue to ensure that the work of the Reserve Defence Force is given recognition within the discussions and the debates we have here.  We will highlight to the Minister of State and the Department the need to address the issues our guests have outlined.<\/p> <p>  Again, on behalf of the committee, I thank Mr. Richardson sincerely for his presentation.  We would also like our guests to convey to the Reserve Defence Force's members our appreciation of the work they do.  I think it was Senator Ned O'Sullivan who said that more of the public became aware of the role of the Reserve Defence Force at the time of the centenary celebrations because they saw individual members participating in the various celebrations around the country.  It is oftentimes only when there are crises or calamities, such as difficult weather conditions, that we become more aware of the work of the Reserve Defence Force.  Again, we ask our guests to convey to the Reserve Defence Force members this committee's appreciation for their work.  I again thank them for giving us a very comprehensive briefing and dealing very well with the issues raised by the members.<\/p> <p>  Before adjourning, I remind members that we have two informal meetings on 13 February and 14 February before we meet again next Thursday with An T&aacute;naiste to discuss the heads of the so-called Brexit Bill.  The committee secretariat has already notified members of these meetings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019020700002#N00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1549532700,"counter":1293,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11.25 a.m. until 4 p.m. on Thursday, 14 February 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
