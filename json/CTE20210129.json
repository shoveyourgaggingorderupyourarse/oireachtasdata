I welcome everyone to our online meeting.  Due to the current situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely but, on the basis of legal advice, members must be within the precincts of Leinster House to contribute to the meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is also attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  The business before us is the minutes of the previous meeting, financial accounts and statements, correspondence and our work programme.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings on 21 and 22 January, which have been circulated to members.

I thank Deputy Verona Murphy.  The minutes are agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published.<\/p> <p>  Six sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 14 and 22 January 2021.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a qualified audit opinion for Children's Health Ireland.  These are the first accounts of Children's Health Ireland, which was established on 1 January 2019 through the merger of three predecessor hospitals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General states the accounts give a true and fair view, except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, which is standard for many health bodies.  Our attention is also drawn to significant non-compliant procurement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued clear audit opinions in all other cases, which are the environment fund, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Oberstown Children Detention Campus and Laois Offaly Education and Training Board, although the Comptroller and Auditor General also drew attention to non-compliant procurement to the value of &euro;575,727 in the accounts of Laois Offaly Education and Training Board.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if he wishes to comment on the financial accounts and statements before I open the floor to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021012900002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611925200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>There are no particular matters to bring to the attention of the committee.

An issue that has been brought to our attention concerns an incredibly important fund that is very much focused on the SME sector and the availability of finance.

The person who gave us the information in the first instance states the Act specifically advises against these funds being used to replace existing borrowings and indicates that if they are not used within two years, they are supposed to go back for reuse by others.  They have not gone back.  Essentially, this may well deny others the opportunity to be resourced to conduct their business because they cannot access funding.  The funding was not to refinance but specifically for use by Irish companies.  We have been told that there is at least one incident of this not occurring.  That is very significant in terms of the functioning of the SBCI.

On the Revenue correspondence, particularly the report on the use of data access requests to telecommunications companies, we see that in 2017 there were 40 such requests.  That dropped to 26 in 2018 and according to the correspondence we received from Revenue, there have been no requests since then.  Could the committee write to Revenue seeking clarification as to why that is the case?  I have a suspicion it might relate to the introduction of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Could we get clarification from Revenue on whether these types of requests simply will not be issued in the future and if that is the case, whether that points to a deficiency in the GDPR legislation and a need for it to be updated?  Could we ask Revenue if there has been any engagement with the Government in this regard?  As I mentioned, 66 requests have been referred.  It would be useful if Revenue could inform us as to the amount recouped to date with respect to those 66 requests, if it has any data reflecting how often it would have made similar requests if this option remained open to them, and if it believes its ability to recoup tax owed to the State has been impacted by the GDPR legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021012900002#G00800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1611925200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>We will ask for that correspondence to be taken up.<\/p> <p>  No. 284B refers to an issue the committee has been dealing with.  It is from Deputy Matt Shanahan and is dated 11 January.  It raises concerns about the recently advertised role of the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  At our meeting on 14 January, the committee agreed to write to the acting Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the matters raised.  This letter issued on 19 January.  We also agreed at our private meeting yesterday to proceed to make an application to the committee on remit and oversight - the Committee on Procedure - to examine the processes by which high level remuneration in the public service is determined.<\/p><p>It is proposed to advise Deputy Shanahan of that.  We thrashed out this issue at length and we sent him a lengthy letter.  We also sent a lengthy letter to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in which we asked 14 questions.  I think Deputy Shanahan's letter even made a recent appearance in the media.  At yesterday's meeting we agreed to write to the acting Secretary General.  It is a very serious issue and people are wondering what exactly has happened here.  It is four weeks since the matter was first raised publicly and, at this point, we are no clearer as to who made the decision to bump up the pay by &euro;81,000 or why the decision was taken.  Was the decision made by civil servants or politicians?  We are told it was not the Government.  Was it a group of Ministers?  The question is who was involved.  We are no clearer on the matter.<\/p><p> Lately, there was a suggestion that part of the reason is that given the head of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, is on an amount in the region of &euro;360,000 that the Secretary General of the Department supervising him would need to be on a higher salary than &euro;210,000 to do that.  I am not sure of the logic of that, because the Secretary General of the Department of Finance is in a supervisory role to some extent over the Garda Commissioner, who is on more than &euro;300,000, and the CEO of the National Treasury Management Agency.  Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy flagged the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021012900002#G00900","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611925200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome the decision by the committee to investigate the overall issue of the remuneration of high-paid public servants.  This stinks to high heaven.  There is no other way of describing it.  Essentially, a job is teed up for a former Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who is now moving into a new Department.  There are so many questions regarding the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the first instance.  You mentioned the governmental impact of it, Chairman.  It is clearly a source of concern for many that this would lead to a situation whereby other high-level public servants would seek significant pay increases in line with what has been proposed for the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  There is no rationale, economic or political, for this decision.  The silence has been deafening in the official response to the issue.<\/p> <p>  Anybody looking at the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts would have to say that we have an obligation, let alone a right, to delve into how this matter was addressed.  I ask whether there is a remit to ensure that this decision is reversed, because it sends out all the wrong signals.  Public servants are on a two-tier pay scale where newer entrants are operating under worse conditions than their colleagues working alongside them, whether it be in schools or other public services.  We must tackle this issue in a robust manner to ensure full transparency in respect of what happened but also so that there is accountability on why the decision was made and whether it can be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021012900002#H00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1611925200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I have addressed this matter in previous meetings.

I completely concur that that captured many of the concerns we collectively had, and that letter came about as a consequence of a collaborative effort to make sure the issues we were concerned about were adequately covered.  I subsequently read in an article that the intention is to reply to the finance committee, which is investigating this and has a different remit to ourselves, but that the Department will reply to everyone on the same day.  The article gave the impression that we were all going to be at loggerheads with each other.  The key issue is that we get to the origin of how this decision was made, what the process was, who was involved in it and what the knock-on consequences are likely to be.<\/p> <p>  As to the piece of work we are going to do, it is important, every time we come up with a constraint in regard to our work, that we name the change that has happened in regard to the Committee of Public Accounts, and that is the standing order the Chairman himself read out at the beginning of the meeting, Standing Order 218.  That imposes pretty strict restrictions on what we can do as opposed to what we were able to do before.  While it does not look like we will be the committee that will be investigating this particular aspect, there is a wider aspect that we are considering.  Obviously, we are looking for an extension of our remit to inquire into such matters, which I think will be very helpful in looking at the broader issues of process and public pay, particularly at the high end.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman or the clerk might go through exactly what the timeline is for us to get a response from the Committee on Procedure on that.  We will have to put that into our work programme in a timely way because it is a complementary piece of work that we will do alongside the work that is obviously going to be undertaken by the finance committee.  The one thing we, as politicians, should not be is to be at loggerheads with each other on this.  If the other committee is going to deal with this, I am perfectly happy that it will do that and it will do that job thoroughly.  However, I think there is another solid piece of work for us to do, and that is what we are seeking to do and seeking an extension of our remit to do.<\/p> <p>  This is going to keep coming up over and over again because this constraint on our remit, as it relates to what it was like before, is a significant change to how the Committee of Public Accounts operates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021012900002#J00100","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1611925200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I concur with the comments of Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy.

This is a long-standing issue.  Unfortunately, the response from the Garda suggests that it cannot comment on the update in respect of this matter because it is currently the subject of an external investigation.  My understanding is that the external investigation comprises the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF.  A role may also have been undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  I suggest we write to both of those bodies inquiring as to whether they are conducting investigations into the Cabra account and if they could provide us with a timeframe.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue with regard to a number of these external bodies which allows agencies that should be accountable to say they cannot comment while the other investigations are taking place.  I note that previously, according to media reports dating back to 2017, the Garda refused to comment because the Committee of Public Accounts was investigating.  Now, it is refusing to comment to the Committee of Public Accounts because another investigation is taking place.  That is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p>  The issues pertaining to the Cabra account were well aired at the time.  We still do not have the nuts and bolts, however, in terms of exactly what happened and, as a result, we cannot put in place procedures to ensure such activity does not take place in the future.

Essentially, this follows on from quite a lengthy inquiry carried out by the previous Committee for Public Accounts.  There were two strands to that.

The work in this regard was done in a timely and effective way.<\/p><p>Some significant changes happened as a consequence of it and it is one example of the effectiveness of the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p><p> The second strand related to European funds.  I concur with what Deputy Carthy has proposed.  My understanding was that GSOC was conducting an investigation into this, but I do not think anything precludes us from inquiring from the commission as to the time it is working to.  We debated two items of legislation in the D&aacute;il this week, one of which related to nominating two additional people to the board of GSOC.  One issue raised by me and others concerned the timely conclusion of investigations and whether there were adequate resources.  The other item of legislation we debated related to European finances and transposing an EU directive.  The reason we are doing it as late as we are is we would be fined if we did not do it.  There is a bit of an irony that we are discussing this issue today, given that it relates to European funds.  We have to pay close attention to it because there are significant consequences for us.  My understanding is that is the aspect that GSOC is examining.  It may well be we need to ask it what the headline of the issue is.  I do not mean the detail, because I understand that an investigation has to happen and GSOC is the competent authority, but we might inquire as to exactly what the investigation is and whether it relates to the two strands of the issue or just one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021012900002#K00600","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611925200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>The proposal is that we publish the item.

One case in question was raised in the public domain in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last August.  It related to a survivor who had an issue with the colour of her bathroom tiles being the same colour as the tiles in the institution in which she was held.  The correspondence that we received was a direct response to questions about that individual.  Ms Downes stated that everything named in that is not the full facts of the case.  Looking at the correspondence that we received, she stated that she was not familiar with the specific cases but she acknowledged that she was familiar with that case while at the committee.<br\/><br\/>The correspondence states that committee members did not contact Caranua in advance of the meeting to discuss individual cases but instead opted to voice allegations as fact without giving Caranua an appropriate or fair right to reply.  I am aware that at least one of the two survivors whose cases were brought up in advance of the committee meeting emailed Caranua directly before the meeting to give their permission to Caranua to discuss their cases and for Deputies at the committee to discuss the case in a public forum.  I have seen that email.  That does not fit with what is in the response and I take issue with it.<br\/><br\/>Caranua claimed in response to previous correspondence from the Committee of Public Accounts to be unfamiliar with the two cases that we are referring to.  That does not hold any weight.  It said it did not know who the individuals were, yet it went on to contact one of those individuals in person after the committee meeting to apologise and re-engage with the person.  The re-engagement did not fully meet the needs of that survivor.  We take issue with this.  We had permission from at least one survivor to raise the issues at the last meeting when Caranua was present and it transpired that the survivor had contacted Caranua to make it aware of that, yet this most recent correspondence does not refer to that at all.  In fact, it is the opposite and Caranua still says it was not aware.  I have seen that email.  There are many issues involved.  We also flagged up the lack of compassion.  For a body set up to help survivors, I was flabbergasted at the lack of compassion shown when we flagged up the two cases that were still outstanding and had not been fully dealt with, and the response was what we received.  We are still engaging with those survivors and will send on the details to the secretariat to try to ensure they get their full entitlements.<br\/><br\/>Caranua indicated that it cannot approve applications for more than &euro;15,000.

There is a balance to be struck.<\/p> <p>  Caranua is winding down.  It appeared before us after the formal close-off date and is not receiving new applications.  The fund was finite to begin with, but anything remaining was to go to, I believe, the children's hospital.  It is not likely that there will be funds remaining.  The Department of Education will take responsibility for Caranua's documents and so on once they are handed over.  However, my understanding is that that legislation has not been published yet.  Whatever funds remain will be used for salaries and so forth because of the time lag between Caranua's closing and the formal handing over, which is required to happen by way of legislation.  We might write to the Minister for Education and ask for the timeline so that we might be satisfied about the issue.<\/p> <p>  A lesson should be learned in all of this about how the metric used to show satisfaction with the service provided by Caranua was one of complaint.  That was wholly inappropriate, given the cohort of people involved.  With the recent publication of the report into mother and baby homes and the discussion of a redress scheme, lessons must be learned about what metrics are employed in evaluating schemes from their users' point of view.  This will have to be a consideration.  We have all heard complaints about how Caranua operated since its establishment.

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.

I am joined by my officials, Nina Brennan, principal officer, who is on the line and will help me out with any hard questions, and Orla O&rsquo;Brien, assistant principal, from the office as well.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, this legislation was proposed in the previous Government's plan to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s corporate, economic and regulatory framework, which was published back in 2017.  The general scheme was developed by my Department and published in 2018.  Pre-legislative scrutiny commenced in early 2019 but was not completed because of the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  In the meantime, my Department worked with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on drafting the general scheme in consultation with the director.  In parallel, planning for the ODCE&rsquo;s transition to a stand-alone independent agency has progressed nonetheless.  This has included an increased budget and staffing levels, including additional garda&iacute;. <\/p> <p>  First, the main purpose of the Bill is to establish the new corporate enforcement authority and to enhance the framework for the conduct of business in Ireland under the Companies Act 2014.  By establishing the ODCE as an agency, it will be better equipped to investigate complicated breaches of company law, which are sometimes very large cases involving multiple offences and multiple parties.  The authority will also have operational autonomy, particularly in terms of the ability to recruit specialist skills and expertise, becoming an agency in its own right rather than an office of my Department.<\/p> <p>  The structure is based on the commission model with up to three members.  It is designed to give the authority the flexibility to structure itself in meeting the differing demands of its remit, which includes investigation, prosecution, supervision and advocacy.  There is the possibility that different commissioners could be given a lead in one particular or another area.  This will also allow the authority to adapt if its workload expands significantly and if it needs to organise work into discrete areas or functions.  In combination, these organisational changes will enhance the capacity of the authority to carry out multiple and complex investigations in parallel if the situation arises. <\/p> <p>  The general scheme also provides that the authority&rsquo;s functional independence is fully compatible with statutory oversight by Government and accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We need to give the new agency the tools it needs to meet the challenges it faces in its investigation and prosecution of alleged breaches of company law.  The general scheme provides that all existing functions and powers of the ODCE-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#C00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1611878400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I think that is Radio 1 or Newstalk joining us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#C00275","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I am not sure what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#C00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>As for the ODCE now, the authority will have the power to issue a range of warnings, directions or notices, the power to enter and search premises and take documents or other material, and also the power to bring summary criminal prosecutions.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the other elements of the general scheme.  The Companies Act 2014 is kept under active review in the light of changing circumstances; for example, court judgments or problems that arise from time to time.  The Company Law Review Group provides valuable expert advice and recommendations on the reform of company law in Ireland.  The general scheme implements recommendations of the group on corporate governance and shares and share capital.  The general scheme also incorporates some additional provisions, including a new ground for the restriction of company directors, measures with respect to the conduct of liquidations and the oversight of liquidators, and measures providing for greater transparency when it comes to the register of companies.<\/p><p> Finally, the general scheme makes some miscellaneous amendments to the Companies Act 2014.  These include technical provisions replacing references to the director in light of the new authority being established.<\/p><p> I will consider any further powers identified as a requirement for the corporate enforcement authority in carrying out its functions in the ongoing development of legislation by the Department.  I wrote to the Chairman in December regarding the report of the Hamilton review and its support for this legislation.  Arising from that review, an action plan will be developed and led by the Minister for Justice.  The Department will be engaged in this work where relevant to its remit.<\/p><p> The Government is keen to progress this legislation.  It is an important milestone for corporate enforcement in Ireland.  By establishing the corporate enforcement authority as a stand-alone agency in its own right, and by providing for its autonomy, resources and enforcement powers, we will strengthen Ireland's regulatory framework for the conduct of business now and into the future.<\/p><p> I look forward to hearing members' views and taking questions on the general scheme.

I recall when the Bill was first mooted.  There was an expectation and a shared ambition across all parties to carry through all necessary reforms to ensure Ireland can have a robust economic regulatory framework.  The legislation before us was first proposed in the Measures to Enhance Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework plan, which was published in 2017.  This legislation is an important part of that plan.  The establishment of the corporate enforcement authority was reaffirmed late last year by the report of the Hamilton review group.<\/p> <p>  I am eager that in 2021 the new authority be established and the Government publish the Bill as soon as possible.  Before doing so, it will be important for us to hear the views of this committee when it reports.  I am very much looking forward to this.  The T&aacute;naiste has set out the main provisions of the Bill.  I do not intend to repeat them.  I emphasise that the establishment of an independent agency is a key milestone in our reforms.<\/p> <p>  The Government is making sure the authority will have the wherewithal to carry out its mission.  The ODCE's funding has already been increased by &euro;1 million or 20% from its base level to reflect the costs of its transition to a stand-alone agency.  Last week, the Department approved the sanction of 14 additional civil servant posts, representing a 35% increase in civil servants.  This will complement the restructuring already undertaken by the director to improve the expertise at his disposal.  Consideration has also been given to the possible requirement for additional garda&iacute;.  Good progress has also been made on other organisational matters such as ICT and accommodation.  We are at a point where the organisation is ready for its establishment as an independent body.<\/p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for company regulation, I see the establishment of the corporate enforcement authority as a solid basis for future reform.  Company law should always be responsive to new developments.  Various suggestions have been made for additional powers, which will be examined by my officials.  I note the director identified possible avenues in this respect in a submission to this committee, but he also pointed out that the focus should be on finalising this legislation.<\/p><p>The Government will be continuing to work on new measures to tackle economic crime and corruption.  An action plan arising from the report of the Hamilton review group is being developed, and it is being led by the Minister for Justice.  My Department will be engaged in that work.

We had representatives of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in with us last week.  They painted a picture of what they face, particularly in respect of resources.  It is clear from what they were saying that a certain amount of white-collar crime is going undetected because the resources are simply not available to deal with it.  That is just a fact.  I am aware that the staff do a very good job prioritising but they just do not have all the resources they need.  Do the Minister and Minister of State have a view on the level of white-collar crime that is going undetected and on how it will be tackled when this legislation is passed?<\/p> <p>  The ODCE painted a picture of the people they are dealing with.  They are well resourced and have deep pockets, and they are also litigious.  It seems like it is quite a combative environment for the office.  Resources will be key.  The representatives before us were looking for staff.  They outlined they would need new staff.  HR staff and other such staff are a given but it is more a question of staff at the technical end and on the front line.  I am interested in hearing whether the Minister and Minister of State accept that there is white-collar crime not being investigated?  Have they a view on staffing?<\/p> <p>  I have another question but want to leave as much time as I can for answers.  The question relates to the additional powers that the ODCE representatives referred to in their submission and in the course of our discussions.  They referred to the need to legislate and to modernise and update the search powers, specifically regarding the cloud, for example.  I will not get too technical because I am not technical, but it is clear that data that used to be in one place now move around.  The view was that additional powers would be needed.

Although I cannot prove it, I suspect that breaches of company, competition and tax law are considerable and much greater in number than we realised.  Obviously, there are various bodies that pursue the perpetrators.  The Revenue Commissioners are very well resourced and do a really great job.  There are also the CCPC and the ODCE, which is the weaker and least resourced of the three bodies pursuing the different types of white-collar crimes that are committed.  This Bill has two objectives - setting up the agency in its own right like the CCPC and Revenue Commissioners and giving the agency the resources to pursue breaches of company law.  I met the director only during the week, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.  The director is relatively happy with the additional resources the agency is getting.  Even though the Bill has not been passed, the budget has been increased and there are additional civil servants, forensic accountants and so on.  The agency is also getting additional garda&iacute;.  It will have eight garda&iacute; at the technical level.  The director said a genuine issue arises over expertise because the really skilled people in areas such as forensic accounting and the really clever lawyers in this space can command the really big bucks.<\/p><p>Potentially, they can command those really big bucks from people who may be breaching these company laws.  Quite frankly, it is always a problem with the public service that we are competing with a private sector that can pay really well.  When we start paying people in the public service really well, we get understandable criticism from people who are on more modest salaries.  However, we think this will give us greater flexibility around that and a greater ability to hire people on a contract basis, for example, to do particular jobs.  One thing Revenue has done very successfully is to get some people back from the private sector who are maybe more motivated by public service and lifestyle issues than the by the big bucks and I would like to see this body doing a bit of that too.<\/p><p> On the powers, we have had a talk about this between Departments and across Government so there is a plan for a new police powers Bill.  That Bill will give additional powers around getting access to electronic information and the cloud and all of those things.  The ODCE would like that but we think that rather than doing it on a piecemeal basis we should give that power across the board, to the Garda, the director and other enforcement bodies and do it through a different piece of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#E00400","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I have only a few minutes left.

He has been quoted as saying that this new agency will be an Irish FBI for white-collar crime.  This certainly sounds very impressive, until one looks at the budgeting for the organisation over the past number of years.  The budget was just &euro;6 million.  I compared that to the amount of money the previous Government spent on welfare cheats.  I remember that famous campaign that I think he fronted: \"Welfare cheats cheat us all\".  That was a campaign costing &euro;163,000 that yielded just &euro;300,000 in repayments.  I did a bit of digging and I noticed there are 277 social welfare inspectors in the Department of Social Protection and a further 98 assigned to the Special Investigation Unit.  In budgetary terms, that is a minimum of &euro;15 million in salaries.  My first question, therefore, is how the T&aacute;naiste explains this dichotomy over the years he has been in Government and has been leading Government, whereby we spend a minimum of three times as much chasing welfare spongers - one might call them poor criminals - as we do on the white-collar criminal class?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#F00500","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>The way I see it is all fraud is wrong, be it tax fraud, company fraud or welfare fraud.  Some people make a distinction between them based on perceptions around the social class of the offender but my view is that anyone who is committing fraud is stealing from the public and stealing from society so in whatever brief I hold, I intend to take a hard line on these issues.  I did so at the Department of Social Protection, I would be doing so were I in the Department of Finance and I am doing it now in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That is one of the reasons I am pushing this forward as a piece of legislation I want to get done so we can crack down on corporate fraud, as we should.  That is why I am putting forward the legislation now and why we are providing more staff and money for the body.<\/p><p>I would envisage that continuing to scale up over the years because we need to crack down on all forms of fraud.  I would never equivocate about the different types of fraud or seek to justify that one type of fraud is in some way different or another is somehow justifiable.  I found that argument very hard to understand when it was made at the time when I was in the Department of Social Protection.  The suggestion was that it was somehow justifiable because other people were committing fraud too and why did we not crack down on all forms of fraud.  This Bill is a good step forward in that regard.<\/p><p> Where I do not agree with Senator Gavan is his suggestion that this is the only means by which the Government combats white-collar crime and economic crime of this nature.  This is just one body and its entire remit is company law.  The Revenue Commissioners have significant resources to deal with tax fraud.  They have much greater resources than the Department of Social Protection.  The budget of the Department of Social Protection is between &euro;20 billion and &euro;30 billion.  Revenue takes in about &euro;50 billion or &euro;60 billion a year.  Revenue is much better equipped than the Department of Social Protection.  Even though Revenue is only dealing with double the amount of money, it probably has more than double the number of staff working as inspectors as the Department.  There is the CCPC as well, which is responsible for competition law.  Then there is the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.

While I do not expect him to comment on an individual case, we know that there are 280,000 files.  The ODCE asked for an additional five staff yesterday.

Having had a lot of review of the legislation, are we in a robust position at this point?<\/p> <p>  The second question is a follow-up to Deputy Louise O'Reilly&rsquo;s question.  We heard last week that when a witness is being cross-examined, it can only be done by garda&iacute; and the experts have to sit outside the room.

Is that one of the things that will be changed?<\/p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, explained that after the financial crisis, the number of liquidations went up to 1,400 per year and then came back down to 400.  There is obviously a concern now that we would see another increase in liquidations.  I understand that will pose questions for the ODCE in terms of making sure that all of those liquidations are done in a robust way.

I see this body as growing, developing and becoming more resourced as time goes on.<\/p> <p>  On financial support for business, as the Senator will know, we have the wage subsidy scheme that helps the payroll and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which helps with mixed costs.  The plan was to start phasing that out at the end of March because we had thought that whatever third wave might arise in January would be much less than what we have experienced.  I think the picture is now very different and we need to be frank about that.  I chair the committee on the economy.  We are going to convene that next week because I think we need to take an early decision, as a Government, to extend the wage subsidy scheme and the CRSS really well into the second quarter if not until the end of the second quarter.  Even if businesses do re-open in the second quarter they will not all re-open and they are still going to need that additional financial support.  All of this is very expensive but, I think, the cost of allowing these companies to fail would be greater than the cost of trying to keep them alive.  We will have a Cabinet committee meeting on that next week.  I want to be in a position to give businesses an early indication of a decision on this so they know in February what is going to happen at the end of March, not in March what is going to happen at the end of March.<\/p> <p>  On the examinership question, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is leading on that so I might hand over to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#L00100","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>.Senator Crowe has raised the issue with me before.

I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State for coming here.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a few observations and then I will ask a couple of questions.  I welcome, as I think most people would, the formation of the authority.  One of things that I would hark back to is the Anglo-Irish debacle regarding David Drumm and Michael Lynn around property and the whole vista that that presented in terms of the perpetrators of white-collar crime almost being seen to get away with it.  For quite a long period that did a lot of damage to the State, in terms of showing that white-collar crime was a crime that was not being prosecuted and there was little fallout from such crime.  I hope that when this authority gets into being it is far more adroit at dealing with such situations.<\/p> <p>  I would reflect what some of the other Members have already said in terms of their concerns around staffing and the T&aacute;naiste has already addressed some of those issues.  I wish to discuss the overall structure, skills set and technology training.<\/p><p>I hope a great deal of focus will be put on this area because modern business largely comprises high-level technology platforms, particularly for international business, and the forensic accounting that is required is of a really high level.  The T&aacute;naiste has highlighted that many people are seconded into the private sector.  We, along with the Garda, will have to consider high-level forensic accounting and ICT skill sets in the future.  Otherwise, we will not be at the races in this regard.<\/p><p>There is also an issue at times with the appropriateness of the direction of the authority, and I am thinking specifically of the SME sector, which I worked in for quite a while.  There is much regulation of private business.  Company directors must be fully registered and use the correct names and PPS numbers associated with the directorships.  That is all fine and well but it puts a great burden on small businesses which may not have a legal office to which they can direct issues.  As somebody who was in that space, I know that when a business owner gets messages from the Department and Revenue and potentially from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement regarding the director's requirements, it puts a great burden on people who are struggling to get ahead.  I hope there will be some balance in regard to the SME sector in the Bill.  Perhaps in future we need to think about a different structure of corporate policy for small businesses, understanding they do not have access to all those resources that businesses do.<\/p><p> The Minister of State highlighted the status of examinership lite.  This will be a fundamental issue for business in the coming months.  I listened intently to the T&aacute;naiste's comments to the effect that he wants to give certainty to business.  That should be a prerequisite, and the sooner it is done, the better.  Many people have used up their savings and their businesses are closed, some of them because they do not have access to the CRSS.  People will be falling over and it is not fair to nail them to the floor because their business models have failed in these times.  Something in this legislation has to accommodate that, whether it is examinership lite or something else.<\/p><p> In the main, I do not think the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister of State needs to add much to what I have said.  We welcome the Bill.  The authority needs to be properly funded and resourced, and the necessary skill set and technology must be pre-eminent in it.  Otherwise, we will not keep pace with where modern business fraud is going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#L00400","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's observations in the round.  It is worth putting on record that when it comes to the ODCE's role in investigations relating to the Anglo Irish Bank debacle or saga, five separate investigations resulted in four trials, all of which resulted in persons being convicted on indictment of criminal offences.  While there is a strong focus on the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick case, which ended on 23 May 2017, and what went wrong there, and while for very good reasons there is great public concern and annoyance about that, it is often forgotten that of the five investigations, there were trials and convictions in four.  One would not necessarily have that impression from the way it is sometimes reported in public, but it was not a categorical failure by the ODCE by any means.  It secured prosecutions and convictions in four of five of the cases.<\/p> <p>  Regulation is something I want to have a closer look at in my time in this brief.  I know there is a great deal of regulation on business, which is very tough on small businesses in particular because they do not have HR and legal departments and so on.  It can be very frustrating and it has made it difficult to do business.  At the same time, I am conscious that one person's regulation is another person's rights, and what businesses will often complain about in terms of regulation is often what other people consider to be their employment rights, environmental rights, health and safety and so on.  I would at some point like to carry out a wider regulatory review, perhaps using the standard cost model, and take a look at all the regulation imposed on business as a whole to see if we could streamline it in some way, even if that just meant reducing the numbers of forms that have to be filled in or of licences that have to be obtained.<\/p><p>These things would not undermine the polity of regulation but might make it easier for people to manage and administer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021012900002#M00200","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

I welcome the Minister's comments about looking at the regulatory burden on small businesses, which is critical.  The Minister mentioned giving visibility to small businesses in the future, which was brought up in the House recently.  It is a matter of expanding the Covid restrictions support scheme to many businesses that are excluded from it because they are not operating from a premises.  I received communication yesterday from somebody in the catering business, who has extensive lease purchases for catering equipment, and there is no more forbearance coming from financial institutions.  That is a significant burden.  I hope that something can be done shortly.

Did I hear correctly that the budget for next year is being increased to &euro;6.3 million, which is an increase of only &euro;300,000 on this year?  The Minister talked about increasing the staff from 44 to 69.  I would have expected a more significant increase in staff if we are going to be serious about tackling this.  Does he anticipate that the additional staff will be specialist IT staff or will they be a combination of HR staff and IT staff?  I know these are necessary too but will the additional staff be specialists in IT and detective work?  Judge Aylmer famously said when the Anglo-Irish Bank case that the failure of the ODCE was stark.  There was a failure to properly investigate shredding of documents and it was not seen to be impartial.

The ongoing role of the task force is now to support the HSE and the Department of Health in planning amid uncertainty and in developing and testing scenarios that enable the vaccination programme to be adapted to a very fluid external environment.  I do not need to elaborate on the issues surrounding vaccine supply.  The task force itself has no executive authority or direct responsibility for the roll-out.  The Minister and the Department of Health are responsible for policy matters, regulatory matters and funding.  The operational delivery of the programme is the responsibility of the HSE under the leadership of its chief clinical officer, Dr. Colm Henry.<\/p><p> There are two main areas on which the task force delivers.  First, the weekly task force meetings draw together expertise and inputs from the Department of Health; the HSE; the Department of the Taoiseach; the Chief Medical Officer; the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC; the HPRA, which is the regulatory body; the Irish College of General Practitioners; and others.  This creates a very valuable forum for addressing all elements of the programme and ensuring full awareness of key risks and issues, which can then be addressed by the appropriate departments or agencies.<\/p><p> The second element is of ongoing importance.  The task force is supported by a programme management office, PMO, led by a programme director, Mr. Derek Tierney.  A key piece of work developed through the PMO is the programme planning roadmap.  This is an integrated design tool which supports adaptive planning of the programme, for example planning for scenarios such as reductions in early deliveries of AstraZeneca vaccines and dealing earlier with the reduction in the number of Pfizer vaccines.<\/p><p> A key operating principle of the programme is that the administration of vaccines will be limited only by supply.  The committee will be aware that there have been some challenges in this regard.  Supply uncertainty remains one of the biggest challenges to the programme.  Supplies continue to arrive, however, and we anticipate continuing to scale up the vaccination programme over the coming weeks and months.  The programme is now firmly in operational mode, and a number of the programme's work stream leads are represented here today.  The task force continues to meet weekly in its role as support to the Department of Health and the HSE, to monitor the progress of the programme and to ensure a strategic and co-ordinated response to any issues that arise.<\/p><p> I will now hand the committee over to my colleagues to discuss the details of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the committee's time constraints so I will perhaps keep to just a few brief remarks in order that we do not go over old ground all the time.  As Professor MacCraith said, we are just four weeks into the programme now, and for very understandable reasons there is intense interest in it nationally and internationally.  It has become a rolling story in some ways, and that probably makes it additionally difficult to continue in a straightforward way to plan and progress the programme under that spotlight.  Operationally, for the HSE and for the Department, we want the focus to be very much on working through this programme and dealing with the evolving events.  I think Dr. Colm Henry on the radio this morning - I do not know if anyone heard him - noted the constantly evolving nature of everything to do with the pandemic, and the vaccination programme, to an extent, is beset by the same challenges.<\/p> <p>  The priority from the start of the programme has been, first, to vaccinate and protect those who are at greatest risk from Covid-19 in terms of morbidity and mortality.  They are, as we know, predominantly older people in residential settings in the first place, and we will shortly move on to older persons in the community as well.<\/p><p>As members will be aware, front-line healthcare workers, on whom the country has been, and will remain, so dependent, have comprised a group that has been addressed early.  That work is in progress.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the challenges around authorisation of the AstraZeneca vaccine, we will hear from the European Medicines Agency, EMA, by early this afternoon.  That will provide a point of certainty from which we can move forward with greater clarity about supply and deliveries.  It will be another tool in our armoury, so to speak, with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines already in use.<br\/><br\/>My colleague, Ms Elizabeth Headon, is with me today.  The committee has identified communications and the communication strategy as an area of particular interest.  The Department works closely with the HSE on the communications aspect of the programme.  Work on it has been in train for several months.  It plays out in phases as the programme progresses.  It is crucial for the public to have confidence in, and understanding of, the vaccines; to be able to access accurate information easily; to receive relevant details at the level of the individual about when, where and how someone will receive his or her vaccination; and to feel confident in the administration of the programme.  The Department has provided the committee an ancillary report outlining the press and broadcast advertising to date as well as social media and news coverage, which we hope members will find useful.  There are high levels of public engagement with the communications channel, with 860,000 visits to the <i>gov.ie<\/i>vaccine site and 414,000 visits to the <i>hse.ie<\/i>vaccine site.  Social media engagement has reached a figure of 2.5 million.<br\/><br\/>Fortunately, research carried out weekly for the Department has demonstrated growing public confidence in and demand for Covid-19 vaccination.  In the early stages, there were questions about whether sufficient numbers in the population woulne, a number well up on what we saw last year.<br\/><br\/>There is a great interest in and demand for information.  At times, it could be said that there is a frenzy of information.  It is important that there be clear communication from all arms of the State regarding the importance of the programme and the fact that it is complex and being run and planned on a clear basis, as set out in the strategy and initial implementation plan.  That plan is a living document and will continue to evolve as we get additional products, the quantity being received comes on stream and we learn more in Ireland and internationally about how the vaccines work in practice.  It will be an evolving programme and will be a big job for most of the year ahead, albeit fortunately one with extremely positive prospects for the country as we vaccinate more of the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Goodman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I am joined today by my colleagues, Dr. Lucy Jessop, director of public health in the HSE's national immunisation office, and Mr. Fran Thompson, the HSE's chief information officer.  Since the committee has my written statement, I will not go through all of it.<\/p> <p>  Vaccines are highly regulated products and the systems and processes put in place to distribute, administer and record their roll-out reflect this.  As Mr. Goodman alluded, each vaccine is considered by the EMA, which then issues a conditional marketing authorization, CMA.  This information is considered in Ireland by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, which makes recommendations on the use of the vaccines to the Department of Health.  The HSE is then asked to implement those recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The Pfizer vaccine comes in multi-dose vials with specific time constraints and cold chain storage conditions.<\/p><p>The national immunisation advisory committee provides the scientific and other advice regarding the management of the vaccine and this advice is updated regularly as more evidence emerges both locally and internationally about the vaccine.  Each change in advice is rapidly acted on and updated guidance is issued to vaccinators.<\/p><p> The national immunisation office, NIO, leads on vaccine supply and distribution.  In addition, the NIO develops and delivers training programmes for already experienced vaccinators via a range of channels including live webinars and the HSE's training portal, HSELanD.  The NIO produces training and information material and distributes that material as well as providing ongoing support to the process.<\/p><p> Digital enablement of the programme is vital to its success.  The vision is to have a fully digitally supported process from end to end covering all aspects of the vaccine programme.  This is a challenging programme given the scope and timeframe for the roll-out.  We are attempting to deliver a national digital programme, which would normally take approximately six months, within three weeks.<\/p><p> The three main processes that must be digitally enabled to have a successful overall offering include the pre-vaccination process, with a citizen registration portal to enable registration, scheduling and consent.  Another is vaccine administration, including validation of citizens' identity, clinical workflow, recording of the vaccine, recording of adverse reactions, scheduling follow-up appointments and the production of a vaccine certificate.  Another process is reporting and monitoring, which is critical and includes reporting and management of data, adverse reaction tracking etc.  This delivery of the system and functionality is being undertaken in stages utilising an agile methodology.  The process involves constant collaboration with the stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage of the project.  Integration of the individual health identifier, IHI, is critical to enable the HSE to safely administer the vaccine.  IHI integration is now live on the system.<\/p><p> The core element for records about the vaccine has been operational since 29 December 2020.  The system is operational across 680 healthcare facilities and is being used by 3,600 healthcare staff who are licensed users of the system.  The general practitioner element of the portal is now live, which allows GPs to register to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.  Once a person presents for vaccination, he or she is validated by an administrative staff member and then the person who is administering the vaccine records the details of the vaccination.  The data are stored on the Salesforce system.<\/p><p> Progress to date includes integration of the system to the HSE service directory entries for more than 2,500 facilities including healthcare sites and new clinic locations.  IHI integration is available, enabling access to real-time GP tables, professional ID validation and Eircode validation.  The teams are working towards integration with GP systems to receive vaccine records.  By Wednesday, 27 January, the HSE had administered a total of 161,500 vaccines across a variety of settings including long-term care and healthcare workers.  The HSE will continue to roll out the vaccine programme in line with the Government strategy over the coming months in line with vaccine supply.  The HSE works in an integrated way with the high-level task force on Covid-19 vaccination, as Professor MacCraith stated, and colleagues in the Department of Health, other Departments and a range of State, voluntary and private agencies to ensure that this programme is successfully delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh.

We need to keep public confidence on our side.  The public needs to have absolute confidence in the ability of the system to tackle and deal with the virus.  One way in which that will be achieved is by ensuring there is confidence in regard to supply chains of the vaccines.  It would be very beneficial to have daily and weekly updates on the number of days or weeks of supply still available in the system and to relate that to the number of vaccinations taking place daily.  That would reassure the public and it is a very necessary part of the process at this stage.<\/p><p> We need to be able to indicate progress in slowing down the virus, that is, the acceleration of the vaccination programme, while at the same time identifying the period, between the roll-out of the vaccination programme and the introduction of restrictions, by which it is presumed the virus is being curtailed.

Since I started in this role, there have been up to ten changes in the information on the supplies of the various vaccines.  We have a level of confidence for this quarter, although it was dented in recent days by the AstraZeneca issue and we are awaiting clarity on that.<\/p> <p>  We are sticking to the principle of administering vaccines as soon as they arrive.  We work right to the edge of the supply that is available.  No vaccines are resting in the fridges or freezers in any given week and I can share those figures with the committee.  We have been adhering to that.  As an example, in the three weeks up to Sunday last, the average number of vaccines administered per week was 48,000, which equates approximately with the volume of supply.  We are adhering to the level of supply, therefore, and trying to manage the situation to keep a supply available for the second dose.  As the committee will be aware, the three vaccines we are considering at the moment are dual-dose vaccines.

I want to make that point first so that we do not overpromise in any of this.<\/p><p> It was stated by Mr. Goodman that there is a lot of intense interest in the vaccine, and, obviously, there is.  I see that as important, something that we should value and something that we should seize upon because ever before a vaccine was approved or a dose came onto this island, the debate and question was whether people would take the vaccine.  That question has been answered by the huge demand right across society for the vaccine.  That is important.  It needs to be recognised and valued and then we have a responsibility to deliver.<\/p><p> Professor MacCraith stated either in his opening statement or in response to a question that the supply depends on what we get from the various different pharmaceutical companies.  There has been, the professor stated, ten different changes.  We accept that as well.  Obviously, to some degree the task force is at the mercy of the providers of the vaccine, but Professor MacCraith stated that there was reasonable confidence for the first quarter of this year in terms of supply.  How does that measure with the Minister's assertions over the past number of weeks?  The Minister was making these assumptions based on the AstraZeneca vaccine arriving.

The same will apply for mass vaccination centres or more local centres, when they are open.<\/p> <p>  In terms of training, and I will seek clarification on this, the last figure I saw was that in excess of 5,000 people have completed the top-up modules in regard to the Pfizer vaccine vaccinator training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>That is welcome and it is a lot of staff.  However, there are questions being asked in regard to the role of pharmacists.  There are 2,500 pharmacists, who, obviously, can play a crucial role.  The Minister said yesterday in the D&aacute;il that dentists will also play a role, which is great, and it is all hands to the pump as far as I am concerned.  However, the Irish Pharmacy Union is concerned that pharmacists have not had any assurances in regard to when their staff will be vaccinated and when they will be part of the vaccination process.  My understanding is that, from what they have been told, pharmacists may not be part of the roll-out for the over 70s, and there is a concern that GPs will be part of it but not pharmacists.  I ask Mr. Walsh to give clarity in regard to the role of pharmacists, first, in regard to when they will be vaccinated, and, second, on their role in regard to the vaccination programme.  Third, if pharmacies are not going to play a role until we get beyond the over-70s, when the Minister says dentists will play a role, at what point will they come into the equation as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#H00400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I may ask Mr. Goodman to comment on some of the issues in regard to who can act as a vaccinator and the regulatory environment around that.

Second, community pharmacy will definitely have a very large role in the overall roll-out of this programme.  When we consider the numbers, although I do not have them in front of me, if there are nearly 500,000 people over the age of 70 in the country and our target for vaccination is ten times that figure, I think community pharmacy will have a huge role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Walsh provide clarity on the point that pharmacists will not be part of the roll-out for the over-70s?

At the outset, Professor MacCraith pointed out how uncertain the situation is.  We all appreciate that.  It is very fluid and it is changing by the day, if not by the hour.  There has been news today that could be quite a game-changer, depending on how it goes.  We all accept that, and it is important that people be reassured, but the best way to give people reassurance is to provide up-to-date, factual information because the goalposts are changing quite a bit.  It is important that we do not raise people's expectations unrealistically.  That is where accurate information comes in.  It is really important that it be provided to the public generally and also to us.  As health spokespersons and as a committee, we have really struggled to get our hands on up-to-date, accurate information.  There is the weekly session in the D&aacute;il but we have not got too much information from that.  What is the basis on which we are approaching this?  We need to be absolutely up-front with people and provide up-to-date, timely information.<\/p> <p>  This raises again the question of whom we must contact when we want to get information about vaccines.  That is a genuine difficulty.  I appreciate the attendance of all the witnesses this morning, but the reality is that the lead person in this area is not present today.  There is something wrong with that.  I accept that the lead person is very busy, was on the radio this morning and has a huge amount to do &mdash; too much, in my view &mdash; but, again, I return to the issue of governance and the question of whom the buck stops with.  While it stops with the Minister politically, whom does it stop with in terms of the operations?  There is a problem in that regard.<\/p> <p>  With regard to accurate and up-to-date information, we are now getting figures twice weekly on the numbers of people vaccinated.  Professor MacCraith said we have the figures on the numbers of vaccines delivered to the country or in the country at any one time.  It is important that we get that information and that it be put on the website of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  It would be great if it could done daily.  I refer to the number of vaccines we have received in the country and how many have actually been administered.  It would be great to get figures daily but even twice weekly would be a big improvement.  Professor MacCraith has said he has those data and is happy to share them.  Will he share them publicly on the HPSC website?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to AstraZeneca.  Obviously, there are major concerns over the reliability of the delivery.

Can it be provided to us in the quantities expected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#L00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Perhaps I can take some of those questions.

Vaccines come in from Pfizer once a week; from Moderna they come in approximately fortnightly.  I say \"approximately\" because in both cases we get confirmation, typically 48 hours in advance.  Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE, has been announcing those numbers at least weekly at his press conferences.  I imagine the HSE would have no problem in sharing those numbers.  Sometimes the way the system works, in terms of the buffer we try to maintain to cover the second dose, is not fully appreciated by everyone.

In addition, there will be many who will be in contact with consultants and might not be in regular communication with GPs.  Is it the case that GPs must trawl through their own files and then contact people or should those who do not have a GP find one?  Should people contact GPs themselves?  What is the capacity among GPs in terms of making contact with people?  Some have huge numbers of patients in their practice who the may not see that often as those patients mainly deal with consultants.  We may not have talked much about the IT system this morning, but I am thinking of GPs' practices and trying to understand the IT set-up, whether the GPs are administering the vaccines themselves or referring patients on.<\/p> <p>  Also on priority groups, the list puts an order with healthcare workers, front-line workers, special needs assistants, those over 70 years of age and those over 85.  There will be thousands of people in some of those groups.  Will there be prioritising of vaccinating within those groups, say a healthcare worker with an illness or who is particularly vulnerable?  If that is happening, how is it going?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have been trying to understand how the IT system will work.  From the early system I saw, it seems that people will be required to create a new account for the vaccination process.  The MyGovID system is intended to be used for exactly this kind of purpose.  In order to avoid the creation and maintenance of yet another single-purpose database containing millions of citizens IDs, will the HSE use the existing MyGovID system as the means to login to the vaccination management system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#N00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I will comment first on people with chronic illnesses - Mr. Goodman may assist on this - and the system in place for GPs to take on a lot more of the care burden in respect of certain chronic diseases.<\/p><p> With regard to GPs, I accept there may be exceptions but, in general, GPs keep a very close eye on their more vulnerable patients and are probably the best source of data and information in terms of joined-up registers of who is within their locality.

Yesterday, I met a parent whose son is 33 years old and has lung cancer for which he is receiving chemotherapy.  People in receipt of such treatments and those on dialysis, for which they are required regularly to attend hospitals, are very concerned about their access to the vaccines.  Are there plans to co-ordinate with the hospitals in regard to vaccination for people who are at-risk patients?  Many of these people are not necessarily attending their GP and as such their vaccination will need to be co-ordinated through the hospitals.<\/p> <p>  My second question is in regard to Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and the roll-out of its vaccine, if approved.  The advantage of this vaccine is that is given in one dose rather than two.

As we get supply, quarter 2 will look very different from quarter 1.  I am not referring to any patient group here but trying to paint a picture of how we see things playing out.

However, I am concerned and I believe we cannot ignore the fact that there is a need for a public health strategy in marginalised communities.  We all know that marginalised communities can be bombarded with false information and scaremongering when it comes to vaccines.  It is important that we develop a clear pathway to positive factual information and access to the vaccine.<\/p> <p>  I imagine the witnesses are aware of Safetynet, which is a primary care facility for marginalised people in society who do not have access to healthcare.  They have reconfigured to respond specifically to the coronavirus pandemic.  The facility has created a mobile health unit.  Those involved have built strong relations with the homeless, migrant and Traveller communities in recent years.  The services they offer are more important than ever now.<\/p> <p>  We know poor health rates are high in marginalised communities.  We need to come up with a good proactive strategy to combat this with the help, hopefully, of Safetynet and more mobile health sites.  Can we plan to strategise with Safetynet in the coming weeks to promote access to information on these vaccines within these communities?  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on that?  I believe those involved provide an important service.

I reiterate what my colleague, Deputy Lahart, said.  It is very important to bring some calmness to this debate and certainly in this forum.  Terms such as \"overpromising\" and \"kicking a political football about\" do not help when many people are on oxygen support this morning and are battling Covid.  I hope we will see AstraZeneca and all the other vaccines we need come through the supply chains right down to community level in the country in the quickest possible time.<\/p> <p>  I thank those who have joined us from the HSE.  They are doing a very difficult job.  Many of the difficulties that have presented in the past three or four days are not of their creation.  It is a supply chain issue, which will largely need to be hammered out at European level in the coming days.  As we have done at each meeting of the joint committee, I acknowledge the immense work by our front-line health service staff.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Goodman might be in the best position to answer my first question.<\/p><p>In the context of the roll-out, from national level right down to county and local health level, I am very concerned that a large cohort of the mental health staff in County Clare and in the University Limerick Hospitals Group have not yet been vaccinated.  We are seeing around the country various news bulletins to the effect that everyone from administrative staff, people who may have the protection of a Perspex screen, to some outdoor staff in hospitals have been vaccinated, yet the mental health staff in Ennis and around Clare have not been vaccinated.  Many of them continue to circulate in the community and call to people's homes and they have not been given that all-important jab yet.  This is very important.  I have raised it with Colette Cowan of the University Limerick Hospitals Group, but still we have no certainty as to when they will get vaccinated.  Elsewhere in the country, I saw the other evening that Bantry hospital in Cork vaccinated everyone.  They have now moved on to vaccinating local GPs, bringing them in very successfully, so there is not parity right throughout the community.  I know a devolved responsibility has been given to each hospital group, but there is a need for co-ordination here as well, ensuring that some rungs of the ladder have not been missed.  In County Clare, they certainly have been missed.<\/p><p> If I may, I will also put the next point to Mr. Goodman.  It relates to GPs being vaccinated.  A number of GPs have been in contact with me.  In the early days of the registration portal there were some technological glitches which meant that as they put in their data those data were wiped, as I understand it, and they had to re-engage with the process again and again, meaning many of them did not register successfully.  It is only in the past day or so that they have been able to do so.  They are wondering whether that technical glitch will delay their vaccination.  That is what I would like to ask.<\/p><p> I have a number of further questions to come in on, but perhaps Mr. Goodman could respond to those two initial ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#U00700","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I think they are for me rather than Mr. Goodman.  I am happy to answer them.<\/p> <p>  Regarding mental health staff in Ennis, and, indeed, elsewhere, and other front-line staff right across both acute and community services, at this point in time I know the numbers look big but we have completed a very small proportion of the total number.  Starting by mid-February, using the portal, which we will talk about again in a minute, and following the prioritisation document based on the relative risk of exposure of all those workers, they will be invited for vaccination and, based on our projected supplies, we should be able to ensure that all those priority healthcare workers will be vaccinated.  The first doses will be administered in February and the second doses, where appropriate, in February as well, with the tail-end of the second doses happening in March.  People have been very patient.  I have seen correspondence from the executive clinical director for that service, which has been very constructive in how it deals with the issues.  I assure the Deputy that they will be dealt with over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  Regarding GP vaccinations, GPs are about to become part of our critical vaccinator workforce as well as being critical front-line healthcare workers in their own right.  A significant number of them have had their first vaccinations through three channels.  One has been through some of the acute hospitals; the second has been through nursing homes, where they have attended on the day when they have patients during vaccination; and the third has been through clinics set up specifically to help with the vaccination of GPs and practice nurses.  That will be repeated and they will have access to those vaccinations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh for that.

I wish to make a few brief points.  It is my understanding - I am open to correction - that many of the child and adult mental health service, CAMHS, personnel have been vaccinated yet they are not offering any programme to the special needs children who are at home.<\/p><p>There is a whole other debate to be had about how their teachers are engaging with them online.  Many CAMHS personnel have been vaccinated, but from what I can see, CAMHS is not out delivering a service.  The HSE needs to consider this matter.  It is frustrating for mental health staff and GPs to see others passing them out on the ladder.  It is also frustrating for teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to see HSE personnel who ordinarily engage directly with children daily not engaging with those children anymore but nonetheless being vaccinated.<\/p><p> I hope that Professor MacCraith can consider having ambassadorial roles for people.  In County Clare, Mr. Anthony Daly, our famous hurler, has an ambassadorial role with Covid response teams.  It would instil great confidence in the nation and reassure the public that this process was safe if, as they were vaccinated, people like Ms Katie Taylor, Mr. Brian O'Driscoll and others with a high profile were used in an ambassadorial role.  There is also an onus on Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to do so.  It is okay to have concerns, but it is not okay for a small number of Deputies to spread false truths.

Nothing frustrates people more than others skipping the queue or, rather, being perceived as skipping the queue.<\/p> <p>  I feel let down by AstraZeneca and the issues surrounding it.  I hope that a solution can be arrived at quickly.  It smacks of big business taking advantage of a difficult situation, particularly given the &euro;336 million investment made by the EU and, by extension, the taxpayers of Europe.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have answered many questions about pharmacists.  Pharmacists are at the heart of many communities and play a key role in administering vaccines.  They have the skills and training and are trusted.  Every year, they administer the flu vaccine.  They do a good job.  Their potential to support communities and provide services has not been realised across a range of areas.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a couple of questions.  Deputy Crowe mentioned GPs.  What percentage of GPs have been vaccinated?<\/p> <p>  I have been approached by chartered physiotherapists, who literally play a hands-on role dealing with clients, be they people with bad backs, bad necks or whatever else.  In terms of placement on the list, they are not regarded as being front-line workers who engage with people despite the fact that they have very close contacts.<\/p> <p>  The situation regarding pregnant women is being reviewed.  Currently, they are at the bottom of the list alongside children and adults.  According to this document, that is to be refined.  Presumably, we are awaiting data from other countries.  What is the rationale?  When will their placement be refined or reviewed?<\/p> <p>  I hope that only a small number of people have received their first doses out of sequence.  When will they be receiving their second doses?  People have asked me that question.<\/p> <p>  Many people believe that, if they get vaccinated, they will be cleared to go and will not have to be restricted.  For example, if foreign holidays were permitted, they believe they could go and return.  Some clarity is needed.  Actually, not clarity, rather, it should be communicated that the vaccines do not stop people from transmitting the virus, only from getting ill.  This shows why everyone must keeping doing the things we have been trained to do over the past year and following the habits we have developed and why everyone who is willing needs to be vaccinated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021012900002#W00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I do not have a figure for the percentage of GPs vaccinated, but they have been vaccinated through a number of channels, as have their practice nurses.

They could be priority healthcare workers.  We have engaged with a number of the professional bodies about their members, especially those in private practice who may feel excluded.  If a chartered physiotherapist is working in an environment where he or she is exposed to Covid-19, he or she is the same as anyone else working in a hospital or other healthcare environment and needs to access the vaccine in line with peers with a similar risk of exposure.

Pregnant healthcare workers are now being vaccinated.  We know that they are at great risk of Covid-19 and are exposed as front-line healthcare workers, so they are being offered the vaccine.  There are some clear guidelines about that and information has been provided by obstetricians and gynaecologists, and answers to frequently asked questions from pregnant women who are concerned about the vaccine are freely available so that they have that information.  Women who are between 14 and 33 weeks of pregnancy are able to get the vaccine if they are front-line healthcare workers.  That has carried on for the last several weeks of the programme.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about a possible misunderstanding about what the vaccine does.  It is clear in the leaflets that one receives before and after receiving the vaccine that it protects one from Covid-19 and its severe effects but it does not stop transmission as far as we know.

The first slide is the one that most people are familiar with.  It shows the number of people in emergency accommodation each month since April 2014.  The most recent data are for November of 2020 and the December data will be published later today.  These are the data that get most attention because they come out regularly each month.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that is not a particularly helpful set of data but rather that the next chart is much more informative.  It tells us the number of people who have entered emergency accommodation for the first time since the beginning of 2014.  We can see nearly 36,000 adults entered emergency accommodation in the country over that time, approximately half of those in Dublin and the other half outside of Dublin.  The significant issue is that over 60% exited emergency accommodation to housing, either in Dublin or outside of Dublin.  Another significant group exited through other means.  In Dublin, we can see over that period we had nearly 11,000 exits to housing and another close to 5,000 exits due to people returning home or, in some cases, going to prison or hospital.  That is why we are left with that figure of approximately 6,000 at any point in time.  However, that is a bit misleading because it does not take into account the huge number of people who enter emergency accommodation and successfully exit it and stay out of homelessness.  Sometimes the images we have of homelessness are of the rough sleeps, those in tents and in emergency accommodation.  It neglects the fact that the vast majority of people who enter homelessness or emergency accommodation exit successfully, usually to housing.<\/p> <p>  The next slide shows the shift that has happened over recent years between the exiting to social housing tenancies, either by local authority tenancies or approved housing bodies, or social housing supports, usually in the form of the housing assistance payment.  The balance has shifted increasingly towards people exiting via a housing assistance payment.<\/p> <p>  The next slide talks about what we have learnt and that we are doing well at present.  First, this is for Dublin.  Dublin runs a very good preventative scheme.  They do not highlight it probably as well as they should.  Every quarter, between 400 and 500 people are prevented from entering emergency accommodation, usually through the provision of the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, which is the basic HAP and up to 50%.  That has been very successful in preventing, as we can see in quarter 3, nearly 500 adults from entering emergency accommodation in the first place.  We are doing fairly well on prevention.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the next two slides give the committee some information on the Threshold tenancy protection services funded by the DRHE and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It shows the number of contacts, the number of tenancies that are protected and the very small number of households that end up in emergency accommodation following the intervention from the Threshold prevention scheme.  We know a fair bit about what works in prevention and it is proving to be particularly successful at present.  The following slide is the same data in another format.<\/p> <p>  We can also see, more generally, that since the Covid restrictions on termination of tenancies in the private rented sector - the biggest driver of numbers in emergency accommodation is people coming from the private rented sector - by April 2020 we had the lowest ever number of new entries into emergency accommodation because of that moratorium.  The number increased over the year.  They were declining again in November and, I suspect, again, in December and January, and will in February and March because of the moratorium on termination of tenancies.  If we were discussing this issue this time last year, we would have been told that due to the constitutional position on private property, we cannot have a ban on terminations of tenancies in the private rented sector.  We have, and we have seen the impact it has had on reducing the number of entries to homelessness.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I wanted to highlight for the committee is that we tend to get focused on Dublin and that the numbers, as Mr. Kenny pointed out, are rising in Dublin, particularly for singles.  Dublin is becoming increasingly unique.  Homelessness is decreasing in practically every other part of the country.  In the south east, numbers have been declining since 2018.<\/p><p>In the west, the number of adults in emergency accommodation has been declining since the beginning of 2019, and in the midlands, that number has been also declining.  Dublin is becoming increasingly unique.  Whereas numbers there are increasing, outside of Dublin the numbers in emergency accommodation have been decreasing since early 2019 and, as such, it is not a Covid effect and something more long-term is going on there.<\/p><p> In my concluding remarks I make the point that ending homelessness is possible but it will not be achieved through charity, compassion or caring, sleep-outs, shelters or soup.  It will be achieved through the large-scale provision of State-funded social housing tenancies, funded by local authorities and approved housing bodies with sustainable streams of funding and eliminating current disincentives to maintaining and retaining the stock.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention and I thank Ms Flynn for guiding us through the slides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Eoin O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Sullivan for his presentation which members only received a short while ago or, possibly, yesterday evening.

I welcome the opportunity to give members our views and to hear theirs.  Yesterday, I forwarded a copy of my opening statement, entitled Wasting Time with People?, to the committee.  My comments are based on our day-to-day, hands-on work since 1973 with people who find themselves homeless.  I have also attached to my opening statement my biography and an information leaflet on the work of the Alice Leahy Trust.<br\/><br\/>We know that everyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas and beyond is concerned about the plight of homelessness.  However, we must ensure that this complex issue receives a complex examination if we are to find a resolution.  Having worked in the field of homelessness for almost half a century now, I would have hoped we could have reached a better outcome than the one so graphically evident on our streets.  Unfortunately, we have not done so, and in spite of the efforts of many and the spending of immeasurable resources, the overall situation has, if anything, worsened.  We still have not reached that point of a holistic, cross-agency, State-sponsored pragmatic response.<br\/><br\/>Members will note the title of my opening statement is Wasting Time with People with a question mark.  This is based on my experience of meeting people in the statutory and NGO sector who find themselves accused of wasting time with people who, perhaps, just want a little time devoted to them alone.  A great deal of time is required to build up relationships with vulnerable people, and it is only from that base that we can hope to see some change.  Homelessness must be looked at from<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>at least two angles.  The structural causes due to lack of housing, which can be eased by increased housing supply, is perhaps the simplest of the two.  The social and personal issues that can lead to homelessness are much more complicated and require early intervention if we are to halt the slide of vulnerable human beings onto our streets.<br\/><br\/>The people we meet who present as homeless have myriad social problems related to the complexity of their personal and unique human condition.  Intergenerational poverty relating to poor finance and education, absence of opportunity to work or to have a stake in society all combine to undermine the person.  Struggling families where child poverty, neglect, violence or abuse have never been addressed or acknowledged can all lead to low self-esteem and often<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>result in homelessness.  Mental health issues are too often dealt with through a medical model response alone.  Relationship breakdown and domestic violence can be huge factors.<br\/><br\/>People become homeless because of their drug-alcohol problem and the challenging behaviour associated with it.  We have a very serious drug problem in our city and in our country.  Wider society needs to be aware of its responsibility and culpability when it comes to the use of recreational drugs.  People who use recreational drugs must recognise the reality that they are supporting a vicious industry.<br\/><br\/>The Alice Leahy Trust on Bride Road in the heart of Dublin regularly meets people from throughout the country and from other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Cities, after all, are about diversity.  Some of these people are linked into services in other areas and this can cause considerable challenges for those attempting to meet their needs in providing shelter.<br\/><br\/>Tragically, we see homeless people dying on the streets.  We help but sometimes, in spite of our best efforts and the efforts of many others, it is not always possible to save each and every one.  We must support and comfort, give all we can in terms of compassion, but sometimes we just cannot enable change.<br\/><br\/>Government, interdepartmental and inter-agency collaboration is required to address these profound issues but it is meaningless unless the views of front-line workers are listened to.  Building up relationships must start with accepting people in all their vulnerability and listening to them; they have a right to be heard.<br\/><br\/>Just last weekend the American author, Sarah Jaffe, was interviewed by Tim Adams in <i>The Observer<\/i>.  She wrote about front-line workers in New York and the nurses &quot;would tell me that they were getting told, in these exact words, 'to not waste time on things that were non-productive', by which the hospital bosses meant caring, getting to know patients&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that working hands-on with people with complex needs takes time, commitment and a belief that anything is possible.  However, that is much harder than ticking boxes and the comfort of bureaucracy.  It is necessary if we are ever to make a real difference. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Leahy.

I thank the witnesses, their staff and their volunteers for the work they do every day supporting people who are unfortunate and who become homeless.<\/p> <p>  The four witnesses have made a great combination of contributions because they bring different perspectives, and they largely confirm a lot of what I believe and understand already.<\/p> <p>  The point was made by Professor O'Sullivan that the profile of people who are homeless, and those who have become homeless over the past five years, has changed.  That is not to say that there are no people who are homeless who have, as described by Ms Leahy, other significant challenges, but there has been a change in the past five or six years that has been driven largely by the lack of supply of affordable housing.  People who have been on the social housing waiting list for many years and who have been in private rented accommodation over the past five years have found themselves homeless.  I commend Mr. Brendan Kenny and the DRHE on the work they have done in Dublin in reducing the numbers.  We are always quick to highlight when the numbers are increasing but these are the lowest numbers in family homelessness, which is great.  We need to see it eliminated.  It is largely down to Mr. Kenny, but I would like his feedback on the funding that has been provided for the voids refurbishment for the city council to do a call for housing, to acquire housing to prevent tenants from being evicted, and to purchase those houses.  I thank him and his staff who have assisted me on a number of occasions and helped to prevent people becoming homeless.<\/p> <p>  Over the past six to 12 months, there has been an increasing use of private operators to provide emergency homeless accommodation.  The numbers of deaths in homelessness make the point starkly.  Eight individuals died on the streets in Dublin, but the vast majority of the remainder of the 60 people who died were in some form of provided accommodation.  Those numbers say that the people who slept on the street did better and were safer than those who went into the emergency accommodation.  I appreciate that there was an emergency response required, but I will give one example of how the emergency response has manifested itself in North Frederick Street in my constituency.<\/p><p>The street is only 100 m or so long but seven privately operated hostels have opened on it in the past six months.  They are operated by bouncers and security personnel.  When they were open I would not have gone into a pub in Dublin that had a bouncer outside it.  I will not do so in the future either because it indicates to me that a pub is not well run.  I would not want to sleep in a facility that required security and bouncers on the door.  I have a real issue with that.  North Frederick Street was lived in by Countess Markievicz, Harry Clarke and Oliver St. John Gogarty.  It is an historic street less than 500 m from O'Connell Street.  Concentrating all of these people in such accommodation is ghettoising people who are homeless.  These are people who had been getting on with their lives.  Many of them had been living in rented accommodation.  I would like a response from Mr. Kenny on that.<\/p><p> My second question is for Dr. Burns.  Dublin City Council, despite all the criticisms I have just made, has clearly made significant strides in reducing family homelessness.  That is due to interventions such as homeless HAP increases and investment in voids and other housing.  What is needed to achieve the same reductions outside Dublin?  While I appreciate the problem is acute in Dublin, there is also a problem outside the capital.  I thank all the witnesses for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#E00300","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick.  The issue with families has improved significantly.  We are very grateful for the funding for the repair of voids.  The HAP system has made a big difference also, as have the council's lettings.  For example, in 2018, we had only 1,400 lettings in the entire year.  In 2019, there were 2,000 lettings so the supply has been improving and that has made a difference.  Obviously, Covid-19 has also made a difference but even before Covid, the situation with regard to families was beginning to stabilise and numbers were reducing.<\/p> <p>  Touching on the issue of private emergency accommodation, the reality is that just before Covid we had a crisis.  We needed emergency accommodation but Covid very much worsened that crisis.  We had to empty some of the hostels in the city.  We had to thin out most of the hostels for social distancing purposes and so on.  We had to very quickly acquire hostels in the city as otherwise more people would have been sleeping and dying on the street.  We managed to have only three deaths from Covid during the whole of 2020.  I believe we would have had many more deaths if we had not done that.  Our only option was to go out and source accommodation in the private sector.  We know that the opportunities that came to us may have resulted in high concentrations in the areas where there was already a high concentration but we had to do that.  We believe the vast majority of these premises are managed very well by private operators.  They are being very carefully monitored.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned bouncers.  The only reason there is a bouncer on the street in question is that we received many complaints about problems outside the buildings and we asked a private operator to put on some security.  That made a difference.  The actual operation and management of the premises is not carried out by bouncers and security.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the deaths, unfortunately, deaths are occurring everywhere.  We have had more deaths in the NGO-managed premises than in the private emergency accommodation.  Deaths are occurring in all premises.  We are concerned at the increase in the number of deaths.  There was certainly a surge from July until the end of 2020 and also in January of this year.  <\/p> <p>  The bottom line in respect of emergency accommodation is that we just had to get it.  It was an emergency.  We have a good situation now, with plenty of beds to spare in the system.  We would like to think that as time moves on over the next year or so, we will eliminate some of the homeless premises - perhaps those on North Frederick Street - and operate in a more strategic way.  We may convert some of these premises into own-door apartments.  The reality, however, is that we had a major emergency in 2020.  We had to do as we did and we are managing.

I also acknowledge the significant contribution Professor O'Sullivan is making to the evidence base of our conversations on these matters.  I also acknowledge two important submissions from other organisations.  The Simon Community has given us a good and detailed submission on prevention and actions it believes need to be taken and Focus Ireland has made a submission on the deaths of people experiencing homelessness and how we - agencies, politicians and the media - should all respond to that.  I strongly commend those submissions to members.<\/p><p>Dr. Sharon Lambert of University College Cork has an exceptional and timely article in the <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>today.  Novas and a piece of work the organisation is doing, to which my colleague, Deputy Gould, will refer in the second round, is mentioned in that article.  I also commend that to people to read. <\/p><p>I will direct my questions to Mr. Kenny and Professor O'Sullivan, and Deputy Gould will direct his questions to Novas and Ms Leahy.  I have four specific questions.  My first is for both Mr. Kenny and Professor O'Sullivan.  Obviously, we are all very concerned by the significant increase in the number of reported deaths of people experiencing homelessness, whether in emergency accommodation or rough sleeping.  I am not looking for an explanation of the reasons for that because I know reports by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and the HSE will look into that, but more what needs to be done now to try to bring that trend down in terms of emergency responses, both from homeless services and the HSE, particularly in terms of addition and mental health supports.  Should we be looking at the practice in the UK of holding adult safeguarding reviews and look-backs when people die in services or care to see how the care can be improved in the future for other users.  <\/p><p>Specifically on three of the issues that emerged in the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme, there seems to be a clear disagreement between the DRHE, as per Mr. Kenny's submission, and the Minister over local connection.  What exactly is the situation on the ground?  We are still hearing of people outside Dublin presenting in Dublin for emergency accommodation being sent back or turned away.  Also, given some of the very distressing phone conversations we were privy to in that documentary, will there be a review of the freephone service?  Are the relevant local authority staff getting the adequate trauma support that Novas is piloting in the south west to ensure they cope to the best of their ability with very difficult circumstances?<\/p><p>Specifically on Professor O'Sullivan's last point on housing, are we delivering enough Housing First tenancies annually?  The number was below 200 last year.  Given that he said we have about 3,000 people in this system, how many do we need on a year-on-year basis?  Does Professor O'Sullivan think the emergency measures that have led to the dramatic reduction in homeless numbers should be continued after level 5 so that we keep managing those numbers down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#G00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Obviously, we are concerned at the increase in the numbers of deaths.  A very intensive review is being carried out through the HSE by Dr. Austin O'Carroll which we will publish.  It is difficult to know exactly how best to try to reduce that figure.  We are not sure if anxiety and issues around Covid have made a difference.  There have been a number of suicides.  Mental health and addiction are the key issues as far as we are concerned.  They will have to be addressed and we will have to do that better than we have done before.  We are working very closely with the HSE on that.<\/p> <p>  On the RT&Eacute; programme, we are on the same wavelength as the Minister.  I have spoken to the Minister a number of times on it.  It is a difficult issue.  In the past month, between 60 and 70 individuals have been accommodated in emergency accommodation in Dublin who have come straight up from the country.  There is a significant increase.  This is all happening when there is a restriction on travel.  We have to be careful about those already in our hostels.  If someone were to come into a hostel with Covid, the disease could spread to everybody in it.<\/p><p> Every local authority has its own responsibility.  We changed the system at the beginning of this year.  We eliminated all the one-night beds, which is a good thing, but it means that we need to carry out an assessment.  We try to prevent people from going in.  We get parents contacting us.  A mother in the west was highly critical of the DRHE for accommodating her son so quickly in Dublin when she really wanted him back.  It is a tricky issue, but nobody is left homeless if there is a risk to anybody.  We are lucky that at the moment because we have beds.  We turned away people years ago because we had no beds, but there are plenty of beds now.  If somebody is genuinely homeless and we have reasonable evidence of that, he or she will get a bed and we will do the assessment afterwards.  Nobody is being turned away at the moment.<\/p><p> Before the outbreak of Covid, we had started a review of the freefone service.  That got stalled somewhat because of the pandemic.  We will reactivate it.  There will be significant changes in the freefone service in the coming months.  We are conscious of the trauma of staff there.  They take over 200 calls each day and it is a very difficult job.  We have managed our way through the pandemic very well.  Some of the DRHE staff contracted Covid and had to be isolated.  We have had to move staff from administration duties to the front line.  There will be significant changes in the freefone service.  We apologise for the incident that was shown on RT&Eacute;.  That should not have happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>There was a question to Professor O'Sullivan on the moratorium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#H00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin actually had two questions.  One was on housing.  There is a reasonably ambitious target to achieve 663 tenancies by the end by the end of this year.  Housing First needs to be expanded.  I sent an updated slide this morning to highlight that this is a clear evidence-based policy that works very effectively, particularly for those with a complex need who have been sold a part-time programme.  This is a tried and tested cost-effective way of managing this issue.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is the supply of one-bedroom apartments.  We probably need a relaxation of the rule that Housing First tenants are only allocated a one-bedroom unit.  We need some flexibility on that.  There is clearly a distribution issue if a person is given a two-bedroom apartment when other people are on the waiting list.  A core element of Housing First is not just the housing but the reconnection of individuals to their extended families, their communities and having space for people to stay overnight and reconnecting with children.  I urge some flexibility on that.  I am not aware of any evidence from the big Housing First evaluations in France and Canada.  There is fear that if people have a spare bedroom, old acquaintances from the street or shelters will want to come in and that may disrupt the Housing First tenancy.  There are anecdotal stories about that, but there is no hard evidence that that is the case.<\/p> <p>  On a moratorium, before the Covid pandemic, a number of people suggested that we needed a period to slow down the flow of households into emergency accommodation and that that required rebalancing the rights of landlords and tenants.  It was a hypothesis at that stage as to whether it would make a difference.  As a result of the Covid pandemic, we now know that it has made a very significant difference, particularly for families and less so for single people.  The reason that single people are still coming in is that they were not in tenancies and rather were doubled up or sharing.  The pandemic exposed that.  It would be good if we had a period of time so that Mr. Kenny and his colleagues could in some way manage things to stop the extraordinary flow every day into emergency accommodation.  We now have very clear evidence that it has worked.  The current period will end on 15 March.  There would be a very strong justification for extending that moratorium, irrespective of the Covid pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Eoin O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Sorry, Professor O'Sullivan-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#H00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>It is not a blanket moratorium and tenancies can still be terminated for very good reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Eoin O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>We have run out of time in that slot, but we can return to the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#H00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank all our guests for being here with us.  Today's presentations are encouraging.  The figures are not where we want them to be but are encouraging nonetheless.  It is really good to see that the preventive scheme is working, that homeless HAP is being used as a successful intervention for families and that the eviction moratorium the Government introduced during level 5 is working.  It is interesting to hear Professor O'Sullivan talk about how he would like to see the moratorium extended beyond 15 March, which is the current plan.  I would be really interested to hear how long he would recommend it be extended for, whether we need a whole lot more time or whether quite a short stint might give us a little breathing space in being able to slow down the entry into emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Housing First is very much the long-term solution when it comes to tackling this problem, but we also need to look at the short-term solutions, one of which is emergency accommodation.  I know that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has talked about this as well.  From my perspective as a Dub, I was quite taken aback that people from outside Dublin featured in the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" expos&eacute; were not getting the same treatment and the same access to beds as people from Dublin.  The Minister tells us there is an average of 40 empty beds in emergency accommodation most nights.  It was also quite disheartening to hear people say they would rather be in a tent on the banks of the canal than in emergency accommodation because they felt safer.  I wonder what we need to do - what inspections we need to carry out, what actions we need to take or what support we need to introduce - to make people feel safer in emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I watched the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" expos&eacute; with the same feeling in the pit of my stomach as everybody else and I agreed with pretty much everything that was said in it.  One time I did disagree, however, was when it was said how every homeless person needed greater access to a key worker.  It is not that I necessarily disagreed with that; I just thought, what if we looked at it a little differently?  It was felt that the key worker needed to be there to help people in homelessness navigate through the bureaucracy of finding permanent accommodation.  Is there a way that we can look at eliminating that bureaucracy instead to empower people and to help them get there more quickly?  I would be particularly interested to hear Ms Leahy's views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#J00100","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I certainly think the moratorium needs to be extended.  For how long, it is hard to know at the moment, but I would suggest that it be reviewed every quarter.  The current moratorium will last until roughly the middle of March.  It should be extended by three months, reviewed at the end of those three months and then extended if necessary.  That might get over the difficulty the Attorney General regularly has with this issue of the balance between landowners' and tenants' rights post Covid.  Exit is no longer a hypothesis; we can demonstrate that the moratorium has dramatically slowed down the flow of households into emergency accommodation.  Therefore, if we do want to do that, we know that this is a policy tool that is available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Eoin O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Mr. Kenny, what needs to be done to make the emergency shelters safer for people to go into?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#J00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":376,"content":"<p>We have an unusual situation at the moment in that there has been a huge increase in the number of tents around the city, areas around the canal and Henry Street as places have got very quiet there.  We would argue very strongly that our hostels, our premises in the city, have reasonable standards and are well managed.  A lot of them are managed by the charitable organisations themselves.  They provide food and toilet and showering facilities.  They are warm.  That cannot be compared with a tent, where it is unhygienic and dangerous and they are at risk of being attacked by gangs of young people and so on.  It is very unhygienic.  We get complaints from residents living in the canal area where people are using their gardens for going to the toilet and things like that.  It is a risky situation to be in and many of them are involved in drug activity.  So we still argue strongly that it is a far better option for people to go into hostels.  We can understand that it is not as simple as that and there are addiction issues and mental health issues.  On Sunday night we had 116 empty beds in the system.  I have never seen that in my whole career in Dublin City Council.  The night before last we had 97.  So there are plenty of beds there.  We know it is not as simple as that but, really, there is a serious issue when the most serious issue we have at the moment is people residing in tents.  It is dangerous and unhygienic and there is no need for it.<\/p><p>We must try to find some way of encouraging people - we are doing our level best through outreach and so on - into hostel accommodation, which is much safer than staying on the streets.<\/p><p> Outside Dublin, we got the balance wrong in a small number of cases.  RT&Eacute; highlighted that.  It is a difficult situation, what with the lockdowns, travel restrictions and so on.  If people have accommodation in Mayo, Galway or wherever but leave it, come to Dublin and seek out accommodation here, we try to return them to where they have local services and perhaps family connections.  Given that we have had excess accommodation for a few months, though, no one is turned away.

I thank Mr. Kenny.  In my interactions with the four Dublin authorities, it is him whom I usually call first.  I acknowledge his significant role, assistance and support.  From time to time, all of us politicians encounter people who are facing homelessness.  They are not in the black area or the white area, but in the grey area in the middle.  There are issues and an immediate need for support, and I have always found Mr. Kenny's door to be open.  More importantly, I have found him and the four local authorities to be supportive.  I tend to go to him.  I apologise for that, but I know he gets things done.<\/p> <p>  I wish to concentrate on two matters in the time available to me, those being, children and other young people in homelessness.  A staggering number of young children are homeless.  We know that children in homelessness suffer higher rates of anxiety, illness and disease infection, difficulties in education, poor nutrition and obesity.  All of these issues have been spelled out for us, but these children also face difficulties from moving around and being unsure of where their homes are.  They are homeless.  There are major issues concerning the emotional stability and vulnerability of these children and their mothers, parents, guardians or whoever is with them.  Will Ms Leahy outline to the committee her first-hand experience of the challenges and difficulties associated with homeless children and young people?<\/p> <p>  We know anecdotally, from experts and from everyone working on the ground, that the cohort of people of 17 to 28 years of age who are transitioning from detention in the prison system or institutional care is exceptionally vulnerable in a range of ways.  When someone is homeless, he or she is vulnerable to exploitation, prostitution, alcohol, drugs, crime and other travesties that damage people's lives.<\/p><p>There are significant challenges with integrating, mixing and socialising the same cohort of people.  We have to do something about that group.  I ask the witnesses to focus on the significant challenges of homelessness for young children and their parents, who are invariably young too, and the challenges relating to people coming from institutional care.  I would like to hear first-hand experiences.  I ask Ms Leahy to address it first and I would be interested to hear other people's views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#K01200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this issue recently and powerfully.  We do not work with children because we do not have the facilities and it would be too dangerous.  However, we are acutely aware of the group of young people that the Senator speaks about.  In our early days working here, all the people we met came from the institutions of the State.  It is in the past now but we still meet people from those days.  It is shocking to see young people coming from care with nothing in place.  More than any other group, they need compassion.  That might be the wrong word to use but they need to be helped, understood and supported on the next step of the way because that is the most crucial one in their lives.  They can so quickly get sucked into homelessness and relationships that certainly would not help them.  This is important and it is why I said earlier that we need to look beyond just housing and have all the services in place to help young people to use the housing.  I know there is a good project in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It should be replicated throughout the country.  We can only do this if we listen to the young people, have patience, give them time and try to understand what they are going through.<\/p> <p>  Whatever we do, we need to make sure that it is a way to support them.  \"Rescue\" is the wrong word to use because if they are not supported at this vulnerable stage, their future is bleak.  What resources are there before they leave?  We need to get the help to them at the beginning but when they end up in care, what resources are in place to enable them to move forward with some degree of confidence?  That has to be addressed by government agencies and people like the Senator who are in a position to do something.  That will only happen if the front-line workers who are attempting to support these young people are listened to.  One needs to be with people.  It is challenging and difficult but it is essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Leahy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Novas has worked with children who are homeless since about 2005.  It was a rare occurrence at the time and the work was largely preventative.  What Professor O'Sullivan spoke about, regarding Threshold's work to prevent homelessness, is vital.  Homelessness among children is an adverse childhood experience.  It is probably one of the worst adverse childhood experiences and the longer it goes on, the more enduring and difficult it is for children to deal with it.  It is important that we prevent children and families from becoming homeless.  The pandemic bringing about the moratorium in evictions has been important in stemming the flow into homelessness.  We can learn much from that and we need to extend it.<\/p> <p>  When children become homeless, evidence both nationally and internationally has shown that the duration of their homelessness needs to be kept to a minimum.  Six months has been the key point for families spending time in hubs.  It needs to be less than that.  The longer it goes on, the worse the childhood experience becomes and the greater the impact in later life.  We need to use hubs for short periods as safe environments which are supported by resettlement staff to get people into long-term secure tenancies.<\/p><p>Sharon Lambert has spoken about this on numerous occasions.  Adults who live in homeless accommodation, particularly those who are entrenched in the cycle of homelessness, will often have spent periods homeless when they were children.  In 20 years' time, for example, the impact this will have on children may be significant.  Prevention, therefore, is essential, whether that is through HAP, direct builds or whatever it is.<\/p><p> Senator Fitzpatrick asked about the issue in other parts of the country.  The HAP discretion rate outside Dublin is 20%, while in Dublin it is 50%, which is a key issue because the 20% rate is just not enough.  Simon Communities published a report earlier this week that showed that not one property in the private rented market in Limerick can be accessed through HAP, nor even through the 20% elevated homeless HAP.  If it is working well in Dublin, we probably need to consider rolling it out elsewhere, even on an interim basis until more public and social housing becomes available.  Again, it is about prevention and that we is what we need to examine.  Instead of trying to fix the problem afterwards, we should get in there before the person becomes homeless.

In her view and from her experience on the ground, are they safe environments in which privacy is given where needed and where the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues are met?<\/p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Kenny, with respect to standards in private and NGO homeless accommodation, are inspections carried out to ensure that standards are met?  If not, are accommodation providers being sanctioned?  Can the DHRE provide annual reports that include financial statements with details of capital and overhead spending?  This is vital for transparency and accountability.<\/p> <p>  On refusal, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the programme for Government are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to accommodation when requested.  Last week, however, \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" illuminated the issue of people being refused accommodation for not being from the area or county.  Can Mr. Kenny speak to this?  If someone is not regularised or is without a PPS number, or for whatever reason is being refused either one night-only or long-term accommodation, what can the DHRE do to ensure that these people have safe accommodation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#M00500","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>In years past, we used to visit all the hostels but we do not do that anymore.  Certainly, from what we hear from people who come to us, some hostels are very well run.  Nevertheless, there has been an increase, as Senator Fitzpatrick and Mr. Kenny noted, of privately run hostels and we have received complaints about some of them.<\/p><p>When we get a complaint, we encourage the person who comes to us with it to complain to the DRHE.  We have been in contact with it about some of those hostels and it dealt with any problems we raised.  I thank Mr. Kenny for that.<\/p><p> I believe that if hostels, privately-run or otherwise, are getting a lot of State aid they should be inspected.  People need to see if those places are comfortable and safe.  There is a terrible danger when one talks about inspections whereby somebody goes in and does not capture the humanity of the staff, which is required by the people staying there.  It is a bit like the bureaucracy where somebody rushes in, has everything in order and, perhaps, does not listen to the little nuggets of companionship or comfort.  I believe we need to look at hostels that are being run as a business, because many of those hostels are referred to.<\/p><p> On the other hand, emergency accommodation had to be found.  This is where we are at now and it is a good time to look at the whole picture.  Are these hostels suitable?  Why do we need to have so many privately-run hostels?  Are the services available or even allowed into those hostels?  We need to acknowledge, though, it is not too long ago that the mantra was to get rid of all the hostels.  There are, however, many long-established hostels around which a certain ethos has developed.  Perhaps, that is why they were set up.  They are very different from privately-run hostels, however.<\/p><p> Certainly, if a lot of taxpayers' money is going into these places we need to ask questions.  We need to ask if people feel safe and comfortable.  There is certainly drug-taking in hostels.  That has come across as a clear concern with people being afraid.  If places are properly run, people should be able to live safely even if it is only for a short time.  These, however, are issues our public representatives need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>With regard to standards, we have a national quality standards framework which applies to all the NGO facilities in the country.  That is monitored overall by the DRHE.  We are now in the process of transferring that framework to other premises that are managed by private operators.  We carry out inspections, however.  We inspect the private premises probably more often than we do the NGOs.  We also have this system where we respond almost immediately to any complaint that comes into us, perhaps within an hour.  We also have in-reach services going into private premises.  That can be like the HSE's social workers or our own in-house support workers.  If they see anything wrong or out of place, they are asked to report it to our standards team straight away and that is quickly addressed.<\/p> <p>  In the past year or two, we brought back some retired staff to carry out inspections on a regular basis.  We want that on a more professional basis.  We are now in the process of undertaking a procurement process to get an independent company to do inspections of all hostel premises in the city, both NGOs and private.  When that process is complete, which should be in the next month or two, we will have that company operating right through the city and all reports from those inspections will be published.<\/p> <p>  With regard to annual reports, we do a report every month to our councillors.  It is circulated to media, and it is not just councillors in Dublin city but those in the three counties as well.  There is no obligation for the DRHE to make up an annual report.  There has, however, been a request to do so in more recent times so we will do that, absolutely.  The previous organisation, the Dublin homeless agency, did it back in 2015.  Therefore, we will have an annual report to be published hopefully at the end of March.  We are under pressure because of Covid-19 but we will do that every year.  We have all the information people are looking for.  If there was any lack of transparency in recent months it is because we simply had to move administration staff to the front line.  We could not keep up with the number of requests.  Much of that information about finance and capital funding and so on is already on the Department's website.

I thank the participants for coming today and, in particular, I pay tribute to Brendan Kenny.  I have worked with Mr. Kenny on Dublin City Council for the last ten years.  He is one of the great examples of a pure public servant.  He has a very can-do attitude and if anyone has a problem, they go to Mr. Kenny.  That is my experience of dealing with him.<\/p> <p>  Professor O'Sullivan talked about the decreasing level of homelessness in other parts of the country.  What would he attribute that to when compared with the situation in Dublin?  One of the things Councillor Anthony Flynn has talked about is that we do not have the numbers for homeless deaths in the country.  For example, we know the figure has increased in Dublin but we do not have a fair representation in Limerick, Cork or Galway.  Perhaps Professor O'Sullivan could give us his experience of that for this year.<\/p> <p>  On a question to Mr. Kenny, one of the issues that came up in the research conducted by BeLonG To on the LGBTQ+ experience of homelessness was the gendered nature of hostels and how some people, particularly trans and non-binary people, did not want to go into hostels because they did not feel safe.  Have any steps been taken to address that or to collect data on that issue?  Has any work been done by Dublin City Council and what is the Dublin Region Homeless Executive's perspective on that?<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Leahy and Novas on the vaccine roll-out programme.  Have they had any indication from the Department of where both their service users and staff are on the list for the vaccine programme?  Do they have concerns about where they are on that list?

It certainly started in most of the regions in early 2019.  It seems to be related to the fairly dramatic slowdown in the rate of new admissions or new entrants into emergency accommodation, rather than more exits from emergency accommodation.  It is just the flow, particularly for families, so I think it is probably a mixture of both prevention and superior rates of exit.<\/p> <p>  Dublin will always be in that difficult position and, like any other capital city in Europe, it will have those additional problems.  At this stage, we probably need a dual strategy, one for Dublin and one for outside of Dublin, because the difficulties in Dublin are profoundly different from those in Mullingar, Galway, Limerick or Cork.<\/p> <p>  In terms of deaths, it is very difficult to know.  I have a difficulty with the term &ldquo;homeless deaths&rdquo; and I think Mr. Kenny has raised this point.  As we said, 37,000 people entered emergency accommodation over the last six or seven years and the number of people who died out of those is absolutely tiny.  While every death is appalling, to say that because I spent a period of time in emergency accommodation or in long-term accommodation funded under section 10, I am somehow to be labelled a homeless death is, to me, profoundly wrong.<\/p><p>We need to find a new language to describe this because they are not homeless.  As per the Focus Ireland submission, the perception is that they are all deaths on the street when they are not.  We need to be very careful with the language we use around this because it is profoundly misleading.  The same is true with some of the headlines we see about homeless deaths.  They are associated with tents and rough sleeping.  We know the November count in Dublin was too high, but it was 137.  No other capital city in Europe has such a low number of rough sleepers and we need to bear that in mind as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Eoin O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Sullivan.

In many respects, the homeless services are a victim of their own success because they have done so well in keeping the case numbers low and keeping transmission of the virus low in services that may not be prioritised in the same way as other residential settings that have suffered to a greater extent.

There have, for example, been reports of a no chatting rule being implemented in a number of them whereby the residents are told they cannot talk to each other, which is an incredible breach of human rights.

We recruited them for the first time.  They did really good work with families.  That is one of the reasons there are fewer families in emergency accommodation.

It is probably important to point out that while this item has been on our work plan for some time, the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme that was aired recently has focused the minds of the public on it.  The stories of Joe, Natalie and Dan show the complexity with which Ms Leahy, Dr. Burns and many others in the homeless sector have been dealing for a long time.  There is complexity and there are those with varying capacities to negotiate what is a very difficult process.<\/p><p>I echo Senator Moynihan's comments on having worked with Mr. Kenny and on all those in the homeless services.  Mr. Kenny should note I was a little taken aback by the conversation I heard between Joe Nolan and the operator on the &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme because it did not reflect my general experience.  I noted the words that were said.  It is important to reflect on this.  Joe Nolan started the call by stating his name and that he was looking for a bed for the night.  A number of short questions, which were not broadcast, were asked and then Joe asked what the story was with getting somewhere for the night.  The operator started his response with, &quot;Wow, I can't book you anywhere here tonight.&quot;  &quot;Wow&quot; is an extraordinary word to start a sentence with.  Then Joe went on to say he was 59, pushing 60, and the operator responded, &ldquo;Hang on a minute now.  Excuse me, in fairness, you haven't rung here before.  Exactly that&rsquo;s the problem.  I don&rsquo;t need your story because, you know, you can ring the system any time.&quot;  Joe then said, &quot;You don&rsquo;t need my story.&quot;  The operator replied, &quot;<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">You have registered in Carlow so you should interact with them.

It is about eligibility and about the lockdown, in that people are not supposed to be travelling over 5 km.  The bottom line is that even before the incident, or long before it, if people were genuinely homeless and we needed to do an assessment, we waited to do the assessment the next day, the following day or three days afterwards, and we would give accommodation.  We did not get the balance right in a small number of cases, which we regret, but anybody who is in need of accommodation at the moment can get accommodation because we have beds.  There was a very difficult time two or three years ago &ndash; I remember it well &ndash; when we did not have beds at all and when dozens of people were turned away every night regardless of where they were from.

These are people who are in recovery and are concerned that everyone is being mixed together in emergency accommodation.  They are concerned about the risk of going back into addiction.  Both in Cork and nationally, we need specific wrap-around services for those in addiction and recovery, those with mental health issues, women and young people to help them out of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Burns touched on something earlier.  There is no emergency HAP outside Dublin.  In Cork because the HAP rates are too low and the rents are too high, people are prevented from getting out of homelessness and into accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I have one question for Dr. Burns and one for Ms Leahy.  Does Dr. Burns believe that people working with homeless people and families should have specialist training in trauma to support people who may be traumatised by their experience of being homeless?  Should that training be expanded to people working in local authorities and the Department of Social Protection?<\/p> <p>  Does Ms Leahy believe the Government is doing enough to end homelessness, especially for those sleeping on the street in the long term?  What can be done to help those people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#S00500","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I agree that front-line staff, social care workers and social workers should be trained in trauma-informed care.  It is a vital intervention to acknowledge the trauma faced by the people we work with and recognise that the consequence of that trauma is how they act.  Their challenging behaviour is not specifically targeted at anybody and they are not trying to be difficult.  It is actually a natural response to significant trauma they have experienced their whole life.  It is often a protection element.<\/p> <p>  Novas is a trauma-care training organisation.  All our staff from our CEO to our kitchen staff are trained in trauma-informed care.  Anybody who has interaction received enhanced training to support people who have had significant trauma and who come into our services.  We have done some single site research on this which has proved that it has significantly reduced the number of serious incidents in our services so that staff are able to de-escalate incidents more quickly and support people to get into safe space, which is really important.  It would be really helpful if that trauma-informed care approach were broadened out to the ancillary services that homeless people access.<\/p><p>For example, if someone is going from residential services to addiction services, mental health services or, as Deputy Gould said, social welfare, the local council or accessing housing, it is really helpful if they get the same treatment across the board.  What is helpful for the clients is empowering for the staff because it gives them a sense of ability to do the job in a better way to support people.<\/p><p> In tandem with that, we need practical responses to support people and prevent unnecessary deaths in homeless services.  As Professor O'Sullivan said, more deaths are occurring in homeless services than on the streets.  We need naloxone to be rolled out to all homeless services, including low-, high- and medium-threshold services, so that we can prevent more people from dying from overdoses.<\/p><p> Given the significant increase this year in the number of people in our services who were self-harming, who had suicidal ideation and who were attempting suicide, we had to implement ligature training among our staff.  Our staff members and front-line workers have ligature knives in the small first aid kits around their necks that they carry everywhere.  They have had to use them and have had to cut people down.  We need a broad spectrum of supports and they need to go across private service providers and emergency service providers.  I will come back to the point on addiction.<\/p><p> I will leave it there because I am conscious of the time.  I am sorry because I seem to have missed the email to submit my paper in advance.  In any event, Deputy Gould is absolutely right.  We need more targeted interventions and supports for people who come out of addiction treatment centres.  If they have worked hard to recover and then go back into low threshold emergency accommodation, the risk to sobriety is serious.  There is no progression for them and the risk of overdose is really high because the tolerance of drugs will have diminished in that period.  We need more targeted services for people.  We need small, integrated services that are attached to the treatment service for people who come out of treatment.  This can give them a sense of progression and a chance to maintain sobriety and exit homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Una Burns","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>It is good to hear from Deputy Gould in the real capital.

That is precisely why the title of my opening statement was, \"Wasting Time with People?\"  We have to give time to staff to enable them to work with complex people.  We owe it to the staff but we also owe it to the people who need to use the services.  We had a training day in conjunction with Dublin City Council some years ago.  It was effective in helping people to understand how we deal with someone who is different.  Perhaps a person was not as complex as the Deputy had in mind.  Anyway, we can only do that if we have training and support.  We have guidelines for all our staff.  We all work very much as a team.  This is one of the issues in the whole area of homelessness.  We need people with experience of life and living, people who have gone through the university of life, as well as the young people who are bright, caring and efficient.  They can support each other to help the most vulnerable.  Apart from the points made by the members, it requires going back to basics and working from that level.

I am not going to sit here and pretend.  It would be silly to say that we do not have a housing and homelessness crisis, but it is important that we acknowledge the progress that has been made on the issue, not only in Dublin but also in other urban centres.<\/p><p>We need to learn from the solutions that are working in other parts of our country.  Unfortunately, the Opposition and elements of the media sometimes focus focused on the negatives around homelessness, without giving sufficient acknowledgement of or coverage to the positives.  I have heard <i>ad nauseam <\/i>that, by every metric, the figures of homelessness are higher than every before.  I tend to tear out the little bit of hair I have left on my head out because such assertions are simply not true.  Last night, I read the figures that were presented by the DRHE very carefully last night.  It was stated that at the end of December the number of families availing of temporary accommodation was at its lowest level since December 2015 and that the number of families living in hotels was at its lowest monthly level since 2014.<br\/><br\/>We are making progress and that is reflected in Waterford where I come from.  Waterford City and County Council has been able to reduce the number of families in emergency accommodation by 93% in the period between 2017 and 2020 and the individual homeless figures by 55%.  This was despite the fact that the number presentations effectively doubled in the same period.  I am firmly of the belief that if that can be done in an urban centre like Waterford, then it can also be done in other urban centres.  It would be useful to delve into how that has occurred.  Professor O'Sullivan did not really have the time to go into great detail at the start of the meeting when he said that the figures for the south east had decreased dramatically.  The reason that has happened is due to a combination of factors and a commitment to a collaborative and integrated approach to homelessness by the local authority, the HSE, NGOs and approved housing bodies and a focus on preventing homelessness, early intervention, tenancy sustainment and the place finder service.  As mentioned by previous speakers, the homeless HAP uplift is an invaluable tool.  However, the 20% uplift is not sufficient for single people and a more targeted approach with a 50% uplift would be more appropriate.  It has really been the collaboration of all of the parties in an integrated homeless hub in Waterford that has prevented people from falling between the cracks.  Do the witnesses agree that the time for operating in silos is at an end and that we need a collaborative approach whereby everyone is sitting in the same room?<br\/><br\/>Obviously, the elephant in the room is supply.  We cannot achieve anything in the absence of supply.  It is my opinion that the approved housing bodies and local authorities have to think outside the box in the context of delivering units.  We cannot continue to have the utopian view that the only way to proceed is by means of direct builds, which are not a quick delivery method.  The repair-and-lease scheme in County Waterford has been transformational in the delivery of one- and two-bed units.  I am sure everyone involved in homeless services would agree that such delivery is key to addressing the homeless figures.  In that context, 44% of the one- and two-bed units delivered by Waterford City and County Council in recent years were delivered through the scheme to which I refer.  It is a crying shame that a scheme that has been proven to work is not being utilised to the full extent by other local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It should not be the case that 45% of all repair-and-lease units in the country have been delivered in Waterford.  There is a correlation between the use of the scheme, an increase in the number of one- and two-bed units in Waterford and a drastic reduction in the number of homeless people in emergency accommodation.  Do our guests agree that county targets should be placed on local authorities and approved housing bodies for the use of the repair-and-lease scheme, particularly when, as I have just outlined, it is clearly working in Waterford?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#T00300","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The witnesses have only 45 seconds in which to answer.<\/p><p>They might provide a written response to Senator Cummins's question on whether targets should be set for local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#U00200","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Can I get a response to my question on the repair and lease scheme and its effectiveness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#V00200","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1611878400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The 44% return of all one- and two-bedroom units through the repair and lease scheme is fantastic.

Some 137 people were numerated in that week.  The weekly count is a new methodology: previously, it was a one-night count.  Based on the quarterly performance reports from Dublin, approximately 700 people sleep rough over a period of the quarter but the majority are in and out of shelters so it is not that they are exclusively rough sleeping.  Despite some of the comments that people do not go into shelters, the vast majority of people who rough sleep also use shelters.<\/p> <p>  In regard to my concluding comment, it is very clear from the data relating to the number of people who entered emergency accommodation and exited it that the most successful and sustainable route out of homelessness is social housing tenancies.  There is no doubt about that.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is very useful in helping to get people out of homelessness.  There is no doubt about that but we know also that the private rented sector, because of the legal ability of landlords to terminate tenancies for a number of reasons that are provided for under legislation, is the biggest source of new entries into emergency accommodation.  If we are serious about providing secure tenancies, we need to do it through the local authorities and approved housing bodies and utilising existing stock.  An excellent report produced two years ago by Professor Michelle Norris and Dr. Aideen Hayden refers to the use of local authority stock and the disincentives that exist for local authorities to make maximum utilisation of stock.  Homelessness is not that complex.  There are a small number of individuals who have complex needs, but in terms of our response, it is not particularly complex.<\/p><p>We know the answers and we know what works for prevention.  We know, from the majority of people who enter homelessness it is the provision of a secure tenancy that will resolve their issues.  They do not need a huge amount of support.  There is a small group that do need that support and we know Housing First works there.  All of the things that we need to end homelessness are there.<\/p><p> On the overall numbers, our numbers are comparatively low.  There is no other city like us that I am aware of in Europe even with different methodologies for counting.  In England during Covid last March, they had to put 50,000 people into hotels from rough sleeping.  This gives an indication of the scale of rough sleeping in England versus our numbers here.  We have had the trade-off.  We have had a massive increase in the numbers of shelter beds in Dublin but it has had the impact of massively reducing the necessity to sleep rough that we see in other European cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#V00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Eoin O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Professor O'Sullivan.

I am reminded of the quote from the Scottish poet Andrew Lang of over 100 years ago.  When asked for a definition of a statistic he said \"He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp-posts ... for support rather than illumination.&rdquo;  Behind every statistic is a human being, and people have complex needs.  It is really much more about the kind of society we are living in.  In homelessness we end up seeing people who do not feel part of that society and who must be encouraged to get back into it.

It is really quite remarkable.  People are cared for in the State due to the extraordinary work that is ongoing.<\/p> <p>  Early this morning the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network ran a forum on sexual abuse and trauma.  One of the contributors there spoke about the inextricable link between trauma and homelessness.  Picking up on Ms Leahy's comments about young people and the need for wraparound services, support and time, I was involved in a very early Foyer project in Dublin with Mr. Brendan Kenny, who was incredibly supportive.<\/p><p>The project is for young people coming out of care and is now run by Depaul.  I wonder about the amount of that supported sheltered housing, involving independent living with wraparound services, that is available.  Are we seeing those sort of developments coming through and what part will they play?<\/p><p> My second question is on Airbnb.  With the lack of tourism and availability, those sort of properties have come back onto the market.  Is there any indication of the percentages of those that are being used for the increased numbers of people exiting homelessness and moving into secure accommodation?  I would be keen to know how we would support that in terms of a strengthening of rules and building on what the previous Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, put in place.<\/p><p> I very much understand the logic of the DRHE in having the local connection.  When the homeless agency was first started around 2000, we all visited Vienna where we spoke to people in its homeless services.  We heard how they put people who arrive in Vienna who are not from Vienna on trains and send them home because they are better dealt with locally where they have family supports.  I have two questions arising from that.  First, what if somebody genuinely wants to come to Dublin because, for a variety of complex reasons, he or she may need to get away from the place he or she is coming from?  How do we support that and allow someone to do so in a situation where there will not be a local connection?  I appreciate that the rules are suspended during the pandemic but post Covid we need to know that someone who is homeless has a right to change city or town in our country and that we have a pathway to provide for that.  My memory of the service in Vienna is that a person was given a pack, his or her train fare was paid and he or she was given supports to get home.  People were not just told \"No\".

This issue was brought up by Deputy Gould earlier.  The DRHE is nearly the last resort now for accommodation.  For a prisoner coming out of Mountjoy Prison or somebody coming out of hospital, it is not a great solution that he or she would go straight into a hostel.  Putting a young lad who has come up from the country and is getting into drugs straight into a hostel in Dublin city is not the best thing to do either.  We have to be conscious of that.  If somebody wants to come up from the country, it is difficult.  There is a local connection in the housing system.  Anybody who is in our hostels at the moment and has got emergency accommodation does not qualify for homeless HAP or to be on the housing list.  The only way they can qualify for homeless HAP or to be on the housing lists is if they go back to their own local authority which can look after them.  There is no doubt that if somebody just wants to come to Dublin that is a difficult one, and it is very difficult to get accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The Foyer project the Senator mentioned is a very good concept.

The concern of many of us is that there is a small cohort of people who live at the intersection of homelessness, mental ill health and addiction.  The numbers of those people who have died in the last year is twice what it was the previous year, based on the data we have.

The double payment of social welfare, which thankfully has ceased, was a significant issue for people in addiction because they were using incredible amounts in the first week which led to an increase in the number of overdoses.  For example, in McGarry House in Limerick during the first lockdown, the number of times we administered naloxone more than doubled compared with 2019 because of the number of overdoses due to the double payment.  That was a significant issue and probably increased the number of deaths this year.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to see what we can do about a second problem we have.  We are encouraging clients to socially distance and stay in their rooms on their own to prevent the spread of Covid but that leads to people using on their own and overdosing on their own.<\/p><p>It is counter-intuitive sometimes to try to separate people.  They might be safer in their own community.  Notwithstanding all the addiction, mental health and dual diagnosis issues that homeless people face every year, this year there were things that were felt more acutely because of Covid.  When we come out of it, hopefully we will see a decline in such issues.  Those are some observations from the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021012900002#Y01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Una Burns","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1611878400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I will follow up in emails.
