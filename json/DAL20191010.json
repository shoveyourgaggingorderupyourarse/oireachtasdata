This is happening because of years of decisions that there were too many hospital beds in the health service.  As a result of the withdrawal of beds during that time, we need to continue to increase the number of beds.  This year, for the first time since 2009, there are 11,000 open beds in the health service.  We need to continue to increase this number while simultaneously reorientating the health service.  I understand that a question tabled by Deputy Brassil, which we will come to later, relates to how we build up our community care.<\/p>  <p>  On budget day, we announced the provision of &euro;26 million between now and 31 December for winter preparedness.  From memory, I think this is the largest sum we have allocated for the period from now until December.  When I met the chief executive of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, on Monday, I made it clear that the HSE needs to get on with spending that money on increasing home care supply, increasing access to transitional care and providing extra funding for the fair deal.  We are announcing the flu vaccine campaign today.  We are fully funding that as well.<\/p>  <p>  We are also looking at access to diagnostics.  The Deputy and I were both present at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health when it was told that on an average day, there might be 30 people in the hospital he mentioned who could get home if they could access diagnostics such as MRI scans and CAT scans.  The provision of mobile diagnostic facilities in places like Limerick is an absolute priority as well.<\/p>  <p>  The emergency department task force, which is meeting today, is one of the many forums at which the issue of overcrowding is discussed.  There will be an opportunity to discuss overcrowding with nurses, patient representatives, doctors and health service managers throughout the country.  I am pleased that Anne O'Connor, who is the chief operations officer in the HSE, has been leading on winter preparedness.  She has been working on integrated winter plans between the community care system and the hospital groups.  These integrated plans will support the development of a single overarching winter plan from the HSE, which will be finalised in the coming days.  I am satisfied that we have provided the HSE with significant funding to increase the number of social and community supports that are available to try to decongest some of our hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital in Limerick to which Deputy Donnelly specifically referred has, like the mid-west as a whole, has been neglected in terms of bed capacity for many decades.  That neglect stops now.  A 60-bed modular unit is under construction in the hospital as we speak.  A further 96 beds are outlined in the capital plan.  This means the hospital in Limerick will see a net increase of approximately 150 beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000003#A01200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1570698000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

It is not helpful to pretend that overcrowding in emergency departments today is caused by beds being taken out of the system over a period of two or three years 15 years ago.

We are now working constructively on an agreed way forward on Sl&aacute;intecare, but we need to hear whether Fianna F&aacute;il is in favour of things like the de Buitl&eacute;ir report on taking private practice out of public hospitals.

It takes time to build a hospital extension and we now have funding for that.<\/p> <p> In the absence of projects like that being ready for this winter, we need to look at how we can shift care into the community and decongest some of the hospitals.  When I was in University Hospital Limerick on an unannounced visit recently, staff talked about the need for more home care.  I credit Fianna F&aacute;il with engaging on this and providing for more home care in the budget.  A significant amount of funding is available for extra home care packages and extra transitional care.  This is the earliest in any year the HSE has had clarity on its winter funding.

Money spent on PR is money spent on campaigns promoting vaccines, including the flu vaccine, and directing people to the appropriate places, including promoting our minor injury units.  When I travel around the country, Deputies on all sides of the House bring me to those units and tell me they could be busier if only people knew about them.  <\/p>  <p>  As far as I know, the value-for-money reviews have been completed and I am very happy to ask the HSE to share them with Deputy O'Reilly and the health committee.  I will also provide the Deputy with a report on the beds opened.  To the best of my knowledge, they remained open but I will confirm that in writing for the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy does not want to go back and forth on recruitment and we regularly debate the status of recruitment, but the published figures for the end of August 2019 compared to the end of August 2018 show 2,625 additional whole-time equivalent people working in the Irish health service.  There are more doctors, nurses and therapists working in the health service than there were last year.  Of course there is a need to do more, but more people are working in the health service.<\/p>  <p>  Individual hospital managers, however, are not able to hire and recruit people for posts which are not funded.  If we did that, Deputies would ask me on the floor of the D&aacute;il about the size of the supplementary budget and how we arrived at that situation.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment is ongoing.  I am using University Hospital Limerick as an example because it has been referenced today.  About 68 additional people have been hired in Limerick in the past five weeks, 48 of whom are, I understand, nurses.  We will put together the HSE service plan and the pay and numbers strategy.  We have announced 1,000 additional staff for the community, and we will discuss that as Deputy Brassil has a question in that regard.  Any beds that have been opened will have to be properly staffed in accordance with the safe staffing framework.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Donnelly asked what is different this year.  In fairness to him, he acknowledged that the HSE made some progress last year in terms of how it co-ordinated its plan.  It did not have a hospital and community plan; rather, it had integrated plans.  There will be a continued effort to build on that this year, including using the national ambulance service.  There is sometimes a challenge whereby people are ready to leave an acute hospital to go to a smaller or less acute hospital but are waiting for ambulance transfers.<\/p>  <p>  I know Sinn F&eacute;in supports the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which also will be a part of the plan.  Last year it gave vouchers for 5,000 diagnostic tests, which helped to take the pressure off emergency departments.  We will do more of that this year and I, in conjunction with the HSE, am happy to fully brief the Deputy on the plans once they have been finalised in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000004#B00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","time":1570698600,"counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000004#B00450"},{"type":"question","time":1570698600,"counter":32,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[41486\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000004#B00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the decisive shift to primary care pledged in the Programme for Partnership Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1570698600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I ask for an update on the decisive shift to primary care pledged in the programme for Government and reiterated in the Sl&aacute;intecare document.

It is recognised that countries with a strong primary care sector have demonstrably better outcomes, lower mortality rates and lower overall health care costs.<\/p><p>As we have seen in recent years, there has been a significant investment in primary care centres around the country and 127 are now open.  I want to be clear.  They are not busy enough in terms of the volume we could be doing to provide services through primary care.  That is not a criticism of the staff, who are excellent.  We need to resource them to do more.  That is why I am very pleased that in the budget announced this week we have received multiannual funding for 2020 and 2021 to hire 1,000 additional front-line staff to work in primary and community care.  That means more public health nurses, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, counsellors, occupational therapists and the sort of people one would expect to be part of a community team.  This will properly staff our network.<\/p><p>In line with Sl&aacute;intecare, a rough estimate shows that about 4,000 additional staff are needed to work within the community if we are to make the Sl&aacute;intecare vision a reality.  This will enable us to deliver 1,000 additional posts, a quarter of what we actually need.  We are committed to delivering the 4,000 additional staff over ten years.  To be very clear, I have spoken to the CEO of the HSE about funding and there will be funding to hire staff for the 1,000 posts by the end of this year because of the commitment given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in his budget day speech.

I assure him that I fully agree with some of the latter end of his contribution because he and the other members of the Sl&aacute;intecare committee having rightly been putting pressure on the Government to deliver multi-annual funding.  If we think we are going to fix the challenges of the health service and bring about Sl&aacute;intecare by just looking budget to budget, we will fail.  That is why one of my biggest asks of the Minister for Finance in budget 2020 was to give me multi-annual funding for Sl&aacute;intecare.  Last year, I succeeded in getting multi-annual funding for the GP contract, which is making that decisive shift and has been accepted by 95% of GPs.  My big multi-annual ask this year was for &euro;60 million in a full year.  It is not the never-never.  As the Deputy is well aware, the recruitment process will mean that all 1,000 posts can be filled by 31 December.  We will have 1,000 people there and the full year pay bill for that will be &euro;60 million.  If I did not get that full-year cost, the Deputy's criticism would be entirely correct but I have now been able to give Paul Reid, the CEO of the HSE, the certainty that on 31 December 2020, he can have 1,000 additional speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, public health nurses and others on his pay bill for the HSE.  That will make a real difference and a decisive shift.

If one breaks it down into the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, one can see that there is a significant reduction in CHOs 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9.

I had hoped to begin initial engagement on some of the issues in pharmacy this year with a view to formal talks starting at the beginning of 2020.  Pharmacists are coming up with solutions and ideas.  We just need to make sure that what they are offering to do is added value or in other words, it is not duplication.  We need to have that discussion about who does what in primary care and I am looking forward to having that discussion with our pharmacies.

We have made some progress on hospital operation waiting lists, which have fallen.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the acute element of the orthopaedic service for this region is currently provided through Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The elective component of the service is provided via the regional orthopaedic unit in Our Lady&rsquo;s hospital in Navan and consultants also work out of Cavan and Monaghan to provide clinics for orthopaedic patients, which is the germ of the Deputy's question.  I understand that the delivery of orthopaedic services in this region is kept under review by the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the Government announced in budget 2020 that it has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, increasing to &euro;100 million in 2020.  I know that is an issue of importance to the Deputy.  This year-on-year increase to the NTPF provides opportunities to further improve waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is now working with the HSE and the fund to develop the scheduled care access plan for 2020.  The HSE service plan for 2020 will set out the planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to improve access to inpatient day case treatment, with a particular focus on hospital outpatient services.  I encourage individual hospitals and hospital groups to put forward proposals for that 2020 funding.  We now have a significant access fund of &euro;100 million and we will be inviting proposals on what more can be done, whether in Cavan, Monaghan or other parts of the country, of which hospital groups are aware.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise the issues noted in the Deputy's question directly with the NTPF and the HSE.

Surely the Department, the Minister, or the HSE could pull this together.

The provision of respite care in Cork is appalling.  It is literally only provided in emergency cases where families simply cannot continue.  That is the reality.  The hard figures I have in front of me show a 38% fall in the number of respite care overnights.

It treats approximately 400 children with diabetes, with an average of between 45 and 52 new children being diagnosed each year.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to further developing and strengthening paediatric diabetic services.\u00a0 The HSE has advised me that an additional permanent consultant paediatric endocrinologist is due to commence duties in Cork University Hospital in January 2020, which will greatly enhance the paediatric diabetic service.  We provided funding in the HSE national service plan for 2019 for recruitment to fill that post and I am pleased that the recruitment competition has been successful.  We have approximately 125 additional consultants working in the health service already this year.  I am pleased to see that the consultant paediatric endocrinologist post has been filled and that the person concerned will commence work in January 2020.  It will make a significant difference to the paediatric diabetic service we can offer children in the south west.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has further advised me that while Cork University Hospital awaits the appointment of this permanent consultant, a locum consultant paediatrician is in place, alongside a part-time consultant paediatric endocrinologist to support additional clinics to target long waiters and patients who had appointments cancelled in the past.  This is a very welcome development not only for people in Cork but also in quite a large catchment area which includes the whole of counties Limerick, Clare, Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny.<\/p><p>We provided approval to recruit these additional posts.

I thank him for his timely question regarding contraception.  I reiterate on the record of this House my view that we need to make contraception free for all women in our country.  We have made very significant progress regarding male contraception in terms of condoms.  We have very significantly increased the amount of condoms being distributed.  We are putting vending machines into a number of locations throughout the country and our sexual health strategy very much aligns with this both in terms of reducing crisis pregnancy and in terms of reducing sexually transmitted infections, STIs, which are at a worrying level in our country.<\/p>  <p>  The question of access to contraception is an important one.  That is why, following on from the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, I established a working group within my Department to examine the range of policy, regulatory and legislative issues because there are issues in each of those areas which arise with respect to improving access to contraception.  I established the group in April and it has overseen a public consultation exercise.  It received many public submissions and submissions from stakeholders.  It has undertaken a review of research and met a number of stakeholders directly.  I am pleased to say the group has just finalised its report and it has submitted to me in recent days for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying that I intend to fully consider the detail of the report but, in doing so, I do not intend to sit on it.  I would like to publish it and will do so this month.  It might be very helpful for the Joint Committee on Health to see it also and to be able to consider some of these issues.   We know, however, that there can be barriers to accessing contraception and that cost can be an issue.  Most forms of contraception, including long-acting reversible contraceptives, LARCs, are provided free of charge to those with medical cards, so we are not starting from a point of nobody having free access.  Many people already have free access to contraception.  I have already mentioned the national condom distribution service, which supports free access to contraception among those who may be at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes.  The working group examined other means by which the costs involved in accessing contraception can be reduced and it has come up with a range of recommendations as well.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to publish the report shortly.  I suggest we will have a body of work to do in terms of legislation and policy options and we should get on and do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000010#H00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1570702200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The Minister stated that the report will be published in the month of October.

Has the Minister made provision in the budget arrangements for 2020 to provide the funding necessary to provide free contraception for all in this State in the year 2020.  As he is aware, Ireland is an outlier in terms of maintaining a cost barrier for women to have access to contraception.

When people see the report, I think it will become very clear to the Deputy that if we as an Oireachtas were to press \"go\" on this, and I hope we do, much of 2020 would be taken up with the need to legislate in this area, as well as the need to engage with the healthcare professionals involved.  They may need engagement regarding fees as well.  I suggest that the cost in 2020 would be minimal because, if we are being honest with each other, this will really arise as a 2021 issue, but I would like this Oireachtas and Government to set the policy direction shortly.  I would like to publish the report this month.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to our county lagging behind in this area.

Currently, in terms of free contraception, there are prescription costs and GP fees.  GP fees and prescription costs need to be removed from the equation.

In addition, there is a pregnancy diabetes service, inpatient ward-based consultation service and inpatient and outpatient podiatry service.  The adult diabetes service at Sligo University Hospital is currently led by two consultant endocrinologists and includes an insulin pump service.  There is also a paediatric diabetes specialist service which provides a regional insulin pump service for children across the north-west region.

I do not disagree with that.  In the HSE capital plan that was recently published, we decided to go ahead and appoint a project brief team.

Has the Government done anything in the past 48 hours to get a sense from Dublin City Council of what is happening and what went on?  Does the T&aacute;naiste think it is appropriate for Dublin City Council to carry out its own investigation, or should the Government appoint an outside investigator to get to the bottom of the matter?  <\/p><p>What is going on at the heart of Government?  Ministers are not exchanging very important information with one another.

The correspondence related to the construction of 73 social housing units in Cherry Orchard and informed the T&aacute;naiste and the rest of the recipients that construction had halted on the site following a sustained campaign of intimidation, with building site workers and security staff under threat.  He stated it was clear that the intimidation has been orchestrated by criminals who had vowed that no work on any Cherry Orchard site would go ahead unless they get the security contracts or receive moneys from the builder.  He continued in the correspondence to the T&aacute;naiste and others by stating:<\/p><blockquote>It is my firm belief that if this work does not progress then we are condemning Cherry Orchard to a future of dereliction and abandonment.

The correspondence was directly addressed to the Minister.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh informed all recipients that matters had escalated, with criminal elements setting out conditions of commencement of construction works, with the Garda and Dublin City Council both aware of it.  He again requested a meeting with the Minister for Justice and Equality, the local superintendents and others to ensure the site would not be compromised and that the demands of criminals would not be accepted.  He requested that a Garda task force be set up to ensure work on the site could commence without workers, security staff or the Cherry Orchard development being held to ransom by criminal demands.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh stated in his letter that he was of the firm belief that if there was submission to the demands of these criminal elements, there would be contagion, not only for other sites in Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard, but throughout the city as word of capitulation would spread.

The Criminal Assets Bureau has stated that a council official arranged payments, with the council denying the allegation.  We have heard the court has opened an initial investigation but that does not go far enough.

[and] \"a stable international tax framework\".  I am referring to those words in the light of the OECD-led work programme to develop a consensus-based solution.<\/p>  <p>  The issue I raise is the need for comprehensive tax reform that would stop corporate tax dodging and limit tax competition.  It is important that Ireland represents a strong voice that is committed at the OECD and at home to addressing the challenges of taxing multinationals in the digital area, to putting a stop to corporate tax dodging, to ending the race to the bottom in corporate tax and incentives and, especially, to generating additional revenues where the economic activity takes place.  It is particularly important for Ireland to be that voice because of our commitment to the least developed countries.<\/p>  <p>  The current system does not benefit developing counties, some of which are our partner countries.  They need the income from corporate tax to provide badly-needed services in health, education and agriculture as well as to mitigate the effects of climate change.  If the corporate tax system is not fair to them - we know it is not - then we are depriving those countries of the ability and capacity to raise revenue through income tax and other taxes.  This is totally at odds with our policies as conveyed in A Better World.<\/p>  <p>  Multiple loopholes in the international tax system allow for artificial profit-shifting to tax aggressive jurisdictions.  Profits generated from sales and other digital activities in one territory can be largely untaxed.  The loopholes mean there is little profit to the countries where the production of goods takes place.  They allow countries to offer lower and lower corporate taxes to be attractive to investors.  One example is tax holidays because of pressure from foreign nationals.  Another example relates to the pharmaceutical industry.  In seven developing countries, four of the big US pharmaceutical companies avoid an estimated &euro;96 million every year.  Some of them pay little tax on profits in Ireland even though they make significant profits here.  Multinational corporations are paying less tax than they did before the crash in 2008.  They continue to shift as much as 40% of their foreign profits to tax havens.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, put a figure of $456 billion on the losses to governments because of corporate tax shifting.<\/p>  <p>  The least developed countries are especially under-represented on the inclusive framing steering group.  As we are committed to A Better World and as we have a strong reputation for humanitarian work, will we also commit to supporting a minimum effective tax rate in every country?  That would mean an end to tax havens and it would benefit the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000014#M01100","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1570704600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for observing the time limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000014#M01200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1570704600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I will try to do the same.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has consistently stated that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.  Change is coming to the international tax system.  The ongoing work at the OECD will result in further substantial alterations to the international tax architecture.  The challenge before us is to build a global and robust tax architecture that works for all into the future.  As part of this work the OECD secretariat has published a consultation paper this week on its proposals.  The paper outlines a potential approach for making changes to the international corporate tax system.  These changes would be designed to reflect the changing nature of where profits are generated in the modern digitised economy.  Ireland welcomes the launch of this publication.  It is important that all interested parties are able to contribute to this important work.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is actively involved in this ongoing work at the OECD to reach a global consensus on addressing the tax challenges of digitisation.  Much work remains to be done before an agreement can be reached at the OECD.  I note some speculation today on the potential impact on Ireland of any changes.  It is far too early at this stage in the process to work out the revenue implications for different countries.  These issues are discussed in the fiscal vulnerabilities paper published with the budget on Tuesday.  As the Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement earlier this week, it is in the interests of Ireland and all countries that this work is successful at ensuring the continuation of a stable and consensus-based international tax framework into the future.  Ireland will continue to engage in this work at the OECD as well as taking actions domestically in line with the corporate tax roadmap.<\/p>  <p>  The point the Deputy O'Sullivan made is that we need to try to have a level playing field in respect of tax rules and transparency through the OECD.  I agree with that.  We have always had an issue with the EU going alone in this regard because of what is happening in other parts of the world.  If we can build consensus, and if Ireland can be part of designing it, that is our clear preference in terms of tax reform into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000014#M01300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1570704600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste mentioned Ireland and all countries but it must be acknowledged that all countries have not had a fair deal to date.  The base erosion and profit-shifting, BEPS, initiative has had some significant benefits, but it does not go far enough.  Multinationals continue to benefit from transfer pricing.  The double tax agreements favour residence-based over source-based arrangements.  This results in capital flows from the developing countries to the developed countries instead of the other way around.  It was disappointing to learn that the concerns of officials in the T&aacute;naiste's Department were ignored when it came to the Ghana agreement.  Prior to that agreement, Ghana could levy 15% on royalty payments and 20% on technical fees but the following the agreement, the figures were 8% on royalties and 10% on technical fees.  Irish companies, therefore, investing in Ghana and other countries will benefit from lower rates of tax.  That has to be at odds with our national plan on business and human rights.  I reiterate that we are so respected in one area that we have to be also respected for supporting fair corporate tax reform in order that those in the developing world can raise the income they need.  At the end of the day, we need an approach that would eventually mean a reduction in overseas aid if they can raise the money they need for services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000014#M01400","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1570704600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Sullivan approaches this from a perspective of global fairness, and I can understand that.

Ultimately, we need to try to build consensus across the developed and developing world about how to have a transparent and fair tax system that allows countries to derive competitive advantage.  However, they need to do that in an open and transparent way and make those choices.<\/p><p>There are consequences to those choices.  This is about striking a balance between allowing countries to make domestic decisions on taxation and how Government expenditure is funded while also closing tax loopholes that should not be there and that create inequality and unfairness.

The Government must provide an incentive so that targets will be met.  Of course, Sl&aacute;intecare cannot be delivered overnight but the question is whether the Government is willing to introduce legislation that will demand that targets are met.  Outpatient numbers are increasing and the demand for elective care is also increasing.  Soon the only elective care that will be delivered in our acute hospitals will be for trauma, emergencies or cancer.  Elective care is slowly being pushed off our hospital waiting lists.  Soon we will have a winter initiative under which elective care will be cancelled for between six weeks and two months, which will only add to the lengthening lists.  When a patient moves from an outpatient list, having eventually been seen, to the inpatient list, he or she moves to the bottom rung of that list.

This budget will result in 1,000 additional staff based in the community.  Recently, an additional &euro;20 million was provided for the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.

Of all days, today is the day to tell the truth about mental health.  It is time to be honest with the people who depend on our mental health services, with their loved ones who support them and with campaigners and the people at large who want something to be done.  These are the same people the Government is trying to fool and gaslight.  Since I was elected to the House in 2016, the Government has talked out of both sides of its mouth with regard to mental health.  I feel sorry for the two junior Ministers in the Department of Health who, I believe, are genuine but who have been forced to defend the crumbs off they table afforded to them each year, which they must know by now will never fully materialise.  Last Tuesday's Budget Statement contains just three mentions of mental health.  These include a reference to the reinstatement of capital funding that was earmarked years ago, a meaningless platitude and, worst of all, for the third year running, just pure bull.  The Government claims that it is providing &euro;39 million of new money for new services but this cannot be true.  Up to this month, &euro;25 million of the allocation announced in 2018 had not been spent, but not for the lack of need.  Every year more money has been promised, withheld, re-announced, withheld again and so on.  According to the Budget Statement, mental health spending in 2020 will be &euro;1.03 billion.  Last week in the D&aacute;il, reiterating the spin of 2018, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, said that more than &euro;1 billion would be spent in 2019.  If &euro;39 million is added to more than &euro;1 billion, it comes to a lot more than &euro;1.03 billion, unless the numbers are false or there is a fabrication.

This increase includes &euro;13 million for new developments and &euro;26 million for pay, which will help to ensure that existing initiatives are maintained and enhanced.  Since 2012, the HSE mental health budget has increased by approximately 44% from &euro;711 million to well over &euro;1 billion next year.  Budget 2019 made allowance for an additional &euro;55 million for mental health services to build on the existing services.<\/p><p>It comprised &euro;20 million for the continuing cost in 2019 of developments initiated in 2018, combined with &euro;35 million for further new developments.

Has the budget been poverty-proofed?  Several features of the budget are clearly regressive, particularly the failure to index-link social welfare payments.  Although the Government flagged that there would be no standard increase of &euro;5 in welfare and pension payments, most Deputies expected that, at a minimum, welfare payments would be index-linked.  The failure to do so, when combined with an inflation rate of, at least, 1.3% or 1.4% next year, with a strong likelihood that it will be more than that, amounts to an effective cut in payments to State pension or social welfare recipients.  For example, there will be an effective cut of &euro;6.12 in the weekly income of a couple on the contributory State pension.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals related to carbon tax and the decisions taken in that regard in the House on Tuesday night are also regressive.  I refer to the additional &euro;6 per tonne in carbon tax.  In promoting this measure, the Government referred at length to the recommendations of the all-party Joint Committee on Climate Action requested.  It is important to bear in mind that the committee also requested a review of energy policy but, in spite of many promises, such a review has not been produced.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul stated that the measures to offset the impact of carbon tax on low-income households are inadequate and that many households will struggle with increased energy costs, notwithstanding the increase in the fuel allowance.  Of course, the fuel allowance is only payable to one in five households in this country.  On what basis was it decided that the increase in the allowance was an adequate response to the serious problem of fuel poverty?  How did the Government come to the conclusion that it was sufficient to address the issue of fuel poverty?<\/p>  <p>  There has been a failure to reform the existing grant schemes.  A carbon tax should act to encourage people to change their behaviour but a very large number of people cannot afford to change their behaviour because of the way the grant schemes are structured.  One needs money upfront to take advantage of them, but many low-income households simply do not have such money upfront.  Will there be a commitment to roll out at an early stage a pay-as-you-go or pay-as-you-save scheme?  Will the Government reform the warmer homes scheme, which is currently only available to those in receipt of fuel allowance, and make it more widely available?  There is a very strict limit such that if one has one's attic insulated, one is not entitled to a further grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000016#O00900","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1570705800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I sometimes think that when the Deputy comments on the Government's budgetary strategy, she fails to accept that choices must be made.<\/p><p>We have had to make a choice this year to assume the worst possible outcome to the Brexit negotiations.  This has been necessary to ensure we have a resilient budget for next year.  The Deputy's response to the budget largely ignores all of that.  We have put in place a social welfare package which increases the social welfare spend by &euro;170 million next year.  We have deliberately prioritised and targeted the most vulnerable people for these extra supports.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has repeatedly outlined where they are.  We are ensuring the overall budget is fit for purpose for next year.  For the past three years in a row, we have had annual increases of &euro;5 in social welfare and pensions across the board.  This was well ahead of inflation.  We took this approach deliberately because we wanted to give back some money while the country could afford to do it.  We will get back into that space again when we know we can afford to do it.  We felt that rather than giving small increases across the board, it was more appropriate to target the lowest-income households, people living alone and people on fuel allowance.<\/p> <p> We chose to protect the people on the lowest incomes because we knew they would be affected by Government policy, including the increase in carbon tax.  We gave them the support they need to reflect that.  That is what we did.  We do not pretend otherwise.  We had to make difficult choices in the context of the economic challenges that may well be on the horizon.  Clearly, Deputy Shortall does not seem to be willing to make those choices.  The idea that we should not introduce a carbon tax increase is counter to what practically every climate change expert on the planet is saying.  Nobody is saying that increasing carbon tax will solve the climate change issue on its own.  By giving a clear direction of the charges that are to be imposed over the next ten years as a means of placing a value on carbon into the future, we are giving society an indication of the kind of change it needs to accommodate.  It is a modest enough increase, but it is a signal of the direction we are taking for the next ten years.  We have put in place measures to compensate the lowest-income families for that.  It is not true to say one cannot draw down grant aid unless one has resources.  Some &euro;53 million is being provided for the warmer homes scheme, which is targeted at people on fuel allowance.  The poorest people are those who will get support from the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000016#O01000","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570706400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Of course everybody understands that choices have to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000017#P00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1570706400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>The Deputy does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000017#P00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1570706400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>This Government has chosen to hit low-income workers, pensioners and people on social welfare.

The average wage of a beef farmer in the State is &euro;8,000, which is less than the State pension.  The only reason it is &euro;8,000 is the subsidy the farmer receives.  Without it, the farmer would be incurring a loss of &euro;5,000.  By working day and night, producing food on which we all live and participating in a massively profitable sector, beef farmers are expected to make a loss of &euro;5,000.  We would not expect that in any other sector and it is all the more shocking, given the fact that the other participants in the sector are creaming it.  One factory made &euro;170 million in profit last year.  The factory&rsquo;s owner is tax resident in Luxembourg and pays 0.5% tax on that profit.  To date, that owner has amassed assets of &euro;3.5 billion, yet the company expects farmers to bring their cattle to the factory gate at a price below cost.  It is unbelievable.<\/p><p>The factories are not alone in doing this.  The supermarket multiples are making massive profits in this sector.  They are participating in a form of competition which is beating down prices, yet they remained unscathed in the beef crisis which gripped the country over the summer.<\/p><p>The reason for the imbalance is the sector is extremely distorted and dysfunctional.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has some experience of economics and must understand the beef sector is asymmetrical.  On one side, we have a small number of large companies which have massive buying power.  On the flipside, there are a large number of small farmers who have no influence whatsoever on any of the terms and conditions of sale.<\/p><p>It is not unusual for the Government to preside over distorted markets.  The housing and insurance markets are other examples.  The problem I have is that the Government has a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>attitude towards getting involved in the beef market.  Thousands of farmers have spent thousands of hours at beef factory gates across the country.  It would be a mistake for the Government to think the crisis is over and that the farmers have gone away.  They have not, nor will they go away until this issue is resolved.<\/p><p>One major problem the farmers have indicated is the refusal of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to intervene in the crisis in rural Ireland.  At the recent national ploughing championships people told me that the beef protests were an insurrection in rural Ireland as they were frustrated by a Government that was Dublin-centric.  People have described the budget to me as a Ross O&rsquo;Carroll-Kelly budget, namely, that it is focused solely on Dublin, in the process forgetting about the rest of the country.<\/p><p>All we are trying to do with the Bill is to ensure farmers can make a living.  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is shaking his head.  A senior Fine Gael Deputy told me that it was unreasonable for farmers to expect a price above the cost of production and that it was also unreasonable for them to participate in a market that would involve some profit from their actions.  People should make no mistake.  The number of farmers in the country is reducing rapidly.  Teagasc stated one third of farmers were being pushed into poverty and debt, while another one third were only functioning within the market because they were supplementing their income by working off-farm.<\/p><p>The Bill seeks to make it illegal to sell below the cost of production on an interim basis.  It is to have a floor in the market at break-even point which would be determined by Teagasc.  Its aim is to send the message loud and clear to the beef factories that they must negotiate properly and that to date they have been well short of the mark.  It is to create balance within the sector.  At the same time, we need the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to do the necessary work to tackle the oligopoly in this market.  We want to have a profitable beef sector, with all elements of the supply chain being able to make a living and be profitable.  We also want to make sure the farmers involved can make a simple living. <\/p><p>I accept that the Bill is not perfect.  It has the support of the Beef Plan movement, as well as Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Will the Government ensure it does not die a death on Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000021#T00400","speaker":"1443"},{"type":"speech","time":1570708800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000021#T00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1570708800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000021#T00600","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1570708800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1570708800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000021#T00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1570708800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000021#T00900","speaker":"1443"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1570708800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Financial Resolutions 2019 - Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed)","time":1570708800,"counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000021#T01200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1570708800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on the following Financial Resolution:<\/p><p>-(Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1570708800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy McGuinness.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on budget 2020 which was unprecedented and unusual in its nature.  It was essentially a no-policy-change budget, mostly uneventful, with little for anybody to be enthused about.  It was, as the Minister for Finance outlined, a Brexit budget, meaning that there would be no significant changes to taxation and a modest welfare package, with some minor tweaks elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit continues to loom large over the country.  As a small open economy, we stand to be severely and significantly affected in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit, which appears to be the most likely outcome.  Talks continue today, but the mood music is more sombre.  The enthusiasm and optimism displayed among all of the negotiating partners seem to be wearing thin.  We are relying on there being a Brexit extension after 31 October.  While there may very well be an extension of perhaps three or six months, what then?  We may have no agreement, with a no-deal Brexit on the horizon.  We appear to be playing a high stakes game and gambling on the outcome of the next British general election.  It is a gamble which risks people's jobs and opportunities.  It is one that makes me deeply uncomfortable and all of us seriously concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Considering the grave risk the country faces and the extreme challenges facing the economy, it is only right and proper that the budget for next year was framed in that context.   It  is right that we try as best we can to make provision in the State finances to protect jobs and help the most vulnerable sectors, namely, agriculture and tourism.  I note, however, that much of the Brexit support funding announced in budget 2020 will be borrowed.  It will not come from the available fiscal space.  The borrowing will be in the region of &euro;650 million.  Accordingly, instead of running a surplus of 1.4%, we are looking at running a deficit of 0.5% next year.  This is despite the fact that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council advised the Government that Brexit support funding should come from the available fiscal space.  This advice has been completely ignored.<\/p>  <p>  The council also gave evidence at the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight that surpluses should have been run within the State finances since 2015.  When the money was available, we should have put some more aside to leave the State in a better position to deal with the challenges of Brexit and other shocks to the economy.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the State finances are not in as good a position as they could have been.  This is not Fianna F&aacute;il saying it; the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said it.  The &euro;40 million that is to be made available to the tourism sector will not be enough to protect the 10,000 jobs that have been identified by Tourism Ireland as being at risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  In agrifood, we are looking at potential job losses in the region of 12,500.  What is being made available needs to be targeted at those vulnerable sectors and loan schemes, while they have their place, will not be enough.  There must be grant aid to smaller operators as they will not be able to afford to borrow to save their business.  Across both sectors mentioned, agrifood and tourism, we are facing the prospect of 22,500 job losses, and these are the two biggest employers in rural areas.  Agrifood and tourism sustain rural communities right across the country and job losses on this scale would devastate rural areas, in particular the west and north-west region.  I see nothing in this budget that focuses on the west and north west, which is worrying and disappointing given that this is the most disadvantaged region in the country.<\/p> <p> Leaving Brexit aside, there are a couple of key issues I wish to address in the context of budget 2020.  The first is the Defence Forces.  The Government only saw fit to allocate &euro;34 million to the Defence budget.  This is despite all of the Government rhetoric about its commitment to the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  This amount is paltry and an insult to those who are serving.  It is deeply offensive and the reaction from the defence community reflects that.  The Minister of State at the Department of Defence has yet again, for another year running, failed to do his job and advocate for the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces is in crisis and is haemorrhaging its best talent at an alarming rate, and this is all the Government could manage.  \"Disappointing\" does not even begin to cover it and until we have a change in government, we can expect little else.<\/p> <p> Carbon tax remains a contentious issue in this budget.  It is the first time we have seen an increase in the carbon tax in many years.  People are genuinely concerned about the impact this will have on those vulnerable to fuel poverty.  It must be acknowledged that carbon tax is particularly impactful in rural areas.  There is not public transport in rural communities and people need their cars to get around.  Electric vehicles are nice if one can afford one but they are out of the reach of most people for now and there is not a second hand market to avail of.  We need to see transparency in how this tax is collected and in how it is spent.  Government policy, forced by Fianna F&aacute;il, is that it must be ring-fenced for green initiatives.  People will need to see in their communities where that carbon tax is spent, be it on retrofitting homes, on helping people to make the changes to a low-carbon economy and on green initiatives, such as greenways, across those communities.  People will need to see that to know that funding is being well spent.  We also need to protect people at risk of fuel poverty.  I welcome the &euro;2 increase per week in the fuel allowance.  Hopefully, this will go some way towards protecting those at risk of falling into fuel poverty.<\/p> <p> We also need to see Government investment in rural transport.  We see lots of investment in metro north and in the Luas, lots of funding for transport in the urban centres but nothing in rural areas.  People in rural communities want transport too and if we are looking for them to change from using their cars, there needs to be something to change to.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the work done by my colleagues, Deputies Cowen and Michael McGrath, in ensuring that there is a just transition fund for the Bord na M&oacute;na workers in the midlands and west.  With funding of &euro;6 million for next year amounting to &euro;30 million overall, it should help those communities that will be most affected.  Job losses in the thousands for a region like that are a significant threat to the region and the local economy and that was a key focus for Fianna F&aacute;il in this budget.<\/p> <p> One of the small positives to take out of this, which again was a key Fianna F&aacute;il policy, was the increase in home help hours of 1 million hours.  That sounds like a lot of hours and sounds like significant progress that will go some way towards addressing the genuine hardship being faced by people, it is worth putting in context.  With over 7,000 people waiting to get home-help hours, if one divides out the 1 million extra home-help hours being made available next year it works out at merely three hours per person per week.  While it is some help, it will not solve the problems we are facing.  Those who need and are getting some home help hours are not getting enough.  I have seen at first hand people who have had their home help hours taken from them in order that they can be divvied out among others who are waiting.  Home help hours allow people to stay in their homes longer.  What we do not want is a situation where elderly people who are able to stay in their own homes and in their communities feel as though they are forced into nursing home care before they are ready to go and when they do not need to.  Nursing home care costs the State far more.  It is penny-wise and pound-foolish to force people towards nursing home care when a few hours per week could be all that is needed to help them stay in their homes.  What we are seeing now is people getting half an hour or, perhaps, three quarters of an hour a day, enough barely to get somebody out of bed and make him or her a cup of tea before the home help person has to go.  It is such a level of cuts to home help and the small divisions of hours available that create the hardship many face.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the increase in Garda numbers, also a key Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  We focus on this because crime is becoming an increasing problem in our communities and people see that a visible increase in police presence is the only way that we can tackle this and make people feel safer.  The 700 new garda&iacute; announced will go some way towards that.  It will not be enough but it is a start.  It was a key focus of Fianna F&aacute;il in this budget to deal with community policing and having more police on the street.  I note An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appreciates the extra allocation.<\/p> <p> There are many other issues to discuss but my time has run out.  I focus on this as being a Brexit budget.  It was quite a sombre budget, and one with which we all identified and realise that there is a difficult year facing the country ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000021#T01400","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570709400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>No doubt the focus of the budget was on Brexit and fairly large amounts were allocated to the various areas that will be affected directly by Brexit.  Given the Brexit argument, which was used by Government to scare people and focus their mind on something that will happen generally to the economy while not addressing what is already happening in the economy, the Government probably has to that extent succeeded.  If the cat had kittens, the Government would blame it on Brexit.  That is the way people feel about it.  The Government has used it as a cover.<\/p>  <p>  In examining the budget expenditure, one must look at what else is happening in the economy to the people who we represent.  Today, for example, is World Mental Health Day.  Around this time, in Windgap, in County Kilkenny, a young 23 year old, who was in the care of the department of psychiatry, is being buried.  There was another one yesterday in Kilkenny.  I ask that the HSE, in the context of that &euro;1 billion expenditure on the mental health system and the delivery of mental health services, investigate the department of psychiatry in Kilkenny and examine why the services are not being delivered in the way that they should to the people who need them today.  There should be no more waiting lists in the context of mental health services.  We do not have the personnel.  We seemingly do not have the infrastructure to deal with the issues arising on a regular basis in this area and funding and investment in infrastructure is needed now.  I would like to see the Government respond more adequately to these issues.  Some &euro;1 billion in a budget is simply not enough.<\/p>  <p>  The general issue in the budget is that the system has not changed.  The Minister allocates the same large amounts to the various Departments but the manner in which that funding is spent has not changed.  We should be debating in this House - it would be a challenge for the Government to arrange this - the 900-page report of the Comptroller and Auditor General pointing out the failures of the State in terms of saving money, making money go further, getting value for money and reforming the systems of the State that allow so much overspending to go on unchecked.<\/p><p>We have a responsibility in the House to give leadership in respect of that reform.  Instead of giving leadership through the various budgets the Minister was responsible for over the past ten years, he has simply funded the <i>status quo<\/i>, throwing money into the deep holes that exist across the economic structure of Departments representing the activities in this State.  As long as that is the case, he will always have increased funding in every Department with very little outcome of which to be proud.  That still goes on.<br\/><br\/>For example, it is reported that the Supplementary Estimate for health was approximately &euro;350 million.  The reality, as the Minister of State knows, is that it was far in excess of that and that services were cut back so radically in recent months, we had no occupational therapy services in Kilkenny and Carlow.  People have been written to asking if they are still in need of the service.  Having been referred to the service by the various medical people, it simply is not available.  Where are the home help hours we were promised in the 2019 budget?  All of those hours and services, and the overspend, will have to be caught up through the 2020 spend and the Government seems to have no bother telling people who need a service today that they will have to wait for six months or two years.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the budget, excluding the Brexit element, the Minister for Finance has failed miserably to provide what is necessary for the care of people up and down the country.  He should be ashamed of some of the decisions he has made.  For example, he refused to tax the vulture funds enough to take substantial money from them.  He refused to tax the banks.  He can give them a ceiling on their losses brought forward but the banks should be taxed.  He should have considered that option.  If he had and had taxed them, how much more could he have delivered then to the people?  Would the building programme for education be affected the way it was if he had to tax those who have the most money and who can afford to pay?<br\/><br\/>The way the Minister treated the elderly, those who are on pensions, those in fuel poverty and those who have major issues in their homes was shameful.  He refused to acknowledge all the debate that has taken place in this House not just last year but since Fine Gael first came into office nearly ten years ago.  He ignored it.  He refused to address the issues that were brought to his attention by various Members and he turned a deaf ear to them.  That is not just foolish of the Minister but it shows disrespect for the fact that on this side of the House we have supported, against the wishes of some supporters and certainly mine, the confidence and supply arrangement.  I believe that arrangement has given the Minister the flexibility to provide cover for the inadequacies and inefficiencies of some Ministers and certainly the Government as a whole.<br\/><br\/>The overspend on the children's hospital is talked about up and down the country.  It is blamed for everything, but there are overspends in other areas and other things that happen in the economy where value for the taxpayer has not been secured.  In this budget, the Minister heaped further costs on the haulage industry, increasing the cost of diesel and fuel.  That means that when their costs increase at some stage, that will be passed on to the consumer again.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has done nothing to look at issues differently in that area.  He has done nothing to prepare small businesses for the significant challenge that Brexit will bring to their door.  He has added cost to everything.  I acknowledge he increased the carbon tax but, as Deputy Lisa Chambers rightly pointed out, in rural Ireland that means there will still be no bus service and, therefore, people will still have to use their cars at a greater cost.  There is an insufficient number of electrical points across the country to help people transition to a different type of vehicle.<br\/><br\/>In the context of cost, the V6 engine operating in most of the trucks hauliers use is cleaner than clean yet there is no recognition of that.  Going the whole hog with this would mean that the truck would double in price.  If we look at the small vehicles used by couriers and so on, we will see the same trend.  There has been a doubling of the price with no real infrastructure to carry on the transition that all of us want to see.  The Minister has not put a plan in place.  He has not put the means in place for those hauliers.  He has simply pushed down on the people who pay their taxes and on the people who cannot afford to opt for public transport because there is no public transport.  He has done nothing in real terms to assist them to get out of the trap they are in.<br\/><br\/>I refer again to the older people in our society, those who rely on their pensions and those in poverty who were hoping for an increase.  It is shameful that the Minister has not dealt with that issue because those same people are on hospital waiting lists.  They are waiting for services that they need today, not tomorrow, and he has done nothing for them.  The country's hospital infrastructure across is creaking and under pressure, and there has been no system change in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I urge the Minister to look at the system that is spending his money - the taxpayers' money - and to do something to ensure that we get greater transparency and accountability with value for the tax man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000022#U00200","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570710000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.

This process has been going on for the past three years.  It has been part of every conversation in every household in the country.  Tuesday's budget was preparation for a no-deal Brexit but it was also preparation for the next general election.  I agree that Brexit will pose a major risk to the economy in Ireland.  It will also create a problem with employment.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;1.2 billion response to Brexit.  I commend the recruitment of 750 additional staff in key areas and the availability of &euro;650 million to support the agriculture, enterprise and tourism sectors.  However, I am disappointed with one aspect concerning the tourism sector.  The Minister had an opportunity to reinstate the 9% VAT rate.  When there was trouble in the tourism sector, the Government reduced the rate from 13.5% to 9% but with the uncertainty of Brexit and the possibility of a no-deal outcome, and with 275,000 employed in that sector and more than 10 million tourists coming here per year, it is an area that the Government has let down.  We took our eye off that market.  I appeal to the Minister of State to talk to the Minister for Finance to see if we can get the 9% rate reinstated.<\/p>  <p>  I support the carbon tax on auto fuel, which is a step in the right direction in terms of climate change, but, again, the Government seems to be targeting the same people all the time.<\/p><p>The Government has targeted pensioners who were hoping to get a &euro;5 increase in their pension benefit.  It has also targeted childcare recipients who were also hopeful they would get an increase in benefit.  It always seems to hit the wrong people.  <br\/><br\/>I come from Dundalk, County Louth.  If one drew a line from Omeath to Cullaville, there would be 50 Border crossings in what is a small area.  We are very concerned about what will happen post Brexit.  We welcome the &euro;81 million the Government has given to recruit 700 new garda&iacute;, but the new recruits will not be ready to be deployed for a while.  The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland stated the PSNI would not patrol the Border.  The Garda Commissioner has stated he does not have enough resources to do so.  While I welcome the &euro;81 million increase in the budget of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is a big hole in the resources needed to police the area stretching from Dundalk to County Donegal.  It is important something be done quickly to address that issue.<br\/><br\/>Dundalk has done really well since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, but like ever other town in Ireland, it seeks more teachers, special needs assistants, houses, therapists and so on  We have Louth County Hospital which is called the &quot;Gen&quot;<b>.  <\/b>It has been open since the 1950s, but its emergency department was closed suddenly in 2010.  There are capacity pressures in hospitals, with many patients being treated on trolleys, but we have a fantastic hospital in Dundalk which is open 12 hours a day, seven days a week.  It is time the Government considered restoring acute services in it.  Since the Government took office, we have been promised a  primary care unit and the provision of more therapists.  We seem to have been promised a great deal.  We have a hospital in Dundalk that is crying out to provide services and there is no reason it cannot be open 24 hours a day.  The Government should seriously consider this.<br\/><br\/>Many constituents who come to my office raise serious issues about their children who may be autistic or have a disability and need assistance.  In fairness, the Government has done a good enough job, especially in introducing an investment of &euro;1.9 billion in special needs education in schools.  I welcome the provision for the employment of an additional 400 special needs teachers and 1,000 special needs assistants.  It will definitely help families.  However, I hope it will not stop the building of new schools and the upgrading of existing schools as education is the way to forward.  It is very important that children be properly educated.<br\/><br\/>The health budget of &euro;17.4 billion, the largest we have ever had, is being increased by &euro;1 billion.  I hope the money will be spent in the right areas.  We know about the trolley crisis, the waiting times for treatment, the shortage of occupational therapists, consultants and doctors.  There is not a day that passes without a constituent coming into my office to complain about the health service.  It is said we have one of the biggest health spends per head of population in the world, but there still seems to be a problem in looking after the health needs of the people.  Therefore, we have a serious problem.  Throwing more and more money at health services will not help to solve the problem.  It is time we sat down with all of the professionals to sort out the problems which have been ongoing for far to long.  There are solutions and it is must a matter of getting them right.  The money is available to do so.  <br\/><br\/>I was very disappointed by the overspend on the national children's hospital project.  We are not talking about an overspend of hundreds of thousands of euro but billions of euro.  A few good opportunities were presented, including the offering of a free site to build the hospital on the grounds of Connolly Hospital, but that offer was not taken up.  There was no good reason not to take it up and that it was not does not make sense.  Those involved in the health service are business people, but I do not think they understand what they are doing.  A site for the hospital was offered just off the M50.  There are 32 counties in Ireland.  Having the national children's hospital located on a site just off the M50 would make much more sense.  I have spoken to doctors and nurses who work in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and they have told me that they cannot park their cars anywhere in the vicinity of the hospital.  They have to get a taxi or take the train to get to work.  I cannot understand how the national children's hospital has ended up being located on the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital campus, especially given the free offer of a site at Connolly Hospital.  I ask that those in government talk to professional people to get some advice.  I welcome the provision of the GP card for children aged under eight years and the medical card for those aged over 70, including couples and single people.  That is good.  However, it is important that we communicate with people.  I ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to engage with professionals who know how to run a business and do things right, even if it means bringing in professionals to give him advice.  There is no point in throwing &euro;17.4 million at the health service next year and then seeking a Supplementary Estimate, or saying this, that or the other.  We have an opportunity to do something right in the sector.<br\/><br\/>The Government has spent &euro;6.6 billion during the past four years in dealing with the housing issue.  Budget 2019 was all based on addressing it, but it is the worse it has ever been.  More than 10,000 people are homeless, of whom 4,000 are children.  The Government has promised that there will be 11,000 new homes in 2020 and 12,000 in 2021.  Where did the &euro;6.6 billion go?  In the budget announced on Tuesday there was a promise of a further &euro;2.5 billion for housing, of which &euro;1.5 billion would be for social housing.  They are great figures, but no progress is being made.  What annoys me is that the middle class are being caught.  A professional couple, both of whom are working, would have to earn approximately &euro;95,000 a year to buy a three-bedroom standard house in Dublin.  What chance do they have with the way the Government is dealing with the issue?  There is no way they can afford to buy a house.  I know people who are caught in the middle.  They are earning good money, &euro;60,000 to &euro;70,000 a year, but they are paying between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,500 a month in rent.  They cannot get a mortgage and the reason they cannot is they have been told that they cannot afford it.  If one gets a mortgage from a bank or a building society for &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000, one pays less per month in mortgage repayments than in rent.  Therefore, it does not make sense to rent.  The Government will have to help the people concerned.<br\/><br\/>Many of the people to whom I refer are not entitled to be placed on a council housing waiting list.  The reason for this is the Government or whatever is provided for in legislation specifies that one must earn below &euro;34,000 or &euro;35,000 a year.  The people concerned are caught in the middle with two, three or four children.  It is time the Government spoke to the local authorities to give them an opportunity.  As the Taoiseach said, they are the people who get up early in the morning to go to work.  They are the people who are entitled to receive something.  They are not looking for handouts and want to work.  What is happening makes no sense.  <br\/><br\/>More than &euro;21 billion is being spent on social welfare payments.  In 2011 16% of the population were unemployed.  In fairness, the percentage unemployed has fallen to 5.3%, but we need to keep the figure at that percentage.  We, therefore, need to encourage people to work.  The Government needs to help the working person by helping him or her to find a house.  <br\/><br\/>The Government seems to target the wrong people.  I refer to elderly people.  A recipient of the contributory State pension in 2019 receives &euro;248.30 per week.  He or she will receive the same amount in 2020.  A recipient of non-contributory pension in 2019 receives &euro;237 per week.  He or she will receive the same amount in 2020.  A recipient of the farm assist payment receives &euro;203 per week in 2019.  He or she will receive the same amount in 2020.  In fairness, a recipient of the living alone allowance will receive a &euro;5 increase in 2020.  Carers do a fantastic job, be it in looking after an elderly person or a person with disabilities.  They save the State a fortune.  They receive a benefit payment of &euro;220 per week in 2019.  They will receive the same amount in 2020.  Recipients of disability benefit receive &euro;234 in 2019.  They will receive the same amount in 2020.  Recipients of jobseeker's benefit and maternity benefit will receive the same payment in 2020 as they do in 2019.  The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance for each qualified child between the ages of four and 11 years will be &euro;150.  For those who cannot afford to send their children to school, the Government is not giving them anything.  The allowance for children over the age of 12 years is &euro;275 in 2019.  The amount will be the same in 2020.<\/p><p> This country has done a fantastic job in recent years and every household has been affected by what has happened.  However, Brexit has taken over.  In fairness, there has been a cross-party effort and we have to thank Fianna F&aacute;il, in particular Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and others for working together.  I hope today's meeting of the Taoiseach with the UK Prime Minister goes well.  If they look for an extension, they should be given an extension.  However, it is going to have to come to a halt at some stage.<\/p> <p> If things go well with Brexit, it is very important that we have a supplementary budget in the new year to give the people what they are entitled to.  We did not do too much with regard to climate change and that is something we will have to do as we go forward.  We are all working together and we all want Ireland to prosper.  It is very important that we all go the same way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000023#V00300","speaker":"1441","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570711200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the Ministers of State, Deputy Finian McGrath and Doyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000025#X00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1570711200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I will deal with this second issue.<\/p>  <p>  This budget marks a significant watershed in respect of our approach to climate.  It implements the approach, on which there has been wide agreement in the House, that we should have carbon pricing.  It is starting with the &euro;6 increase and the intention is that there will be a steady increase over the period such that we get to &euro;80 per tonne in 2030.  The reason for a steady increase is so those who face difficulty in making the adjustment are not hit with a sudden jolt and have an opportunity to plan.<\/p>  <p>  The other significant element is that every cent being raised from the carbon tax will be given back to people.  The Minister for Finance rightly view three categories as important.  The first is that we must protect those most exposed, in particular those like the Bord na M&oacute;na workers or others who are directly affected, and who rightly expect that there should be a just transition for them.<\/p>  <p>  The second group are the people who are least well equipped to make changes in this transition.  This has been a central feature of the budget.  Not only are 22% protected with the &euro;2 per week fuel allowance increased, but even more significant is the allocation of &euro;53 million this year, double what we had last year, for the warmer homes scheme, with which many Deputies will be familiar.  That scheme means those on fuel schemes can get permanent improvements made to their home.  On average, those permanent improvements will deliver &euro;1,200 in savings per year in the energy bills of those directly affected.  We are, therefore, providing &euro;56 per week under the fuel allowance scheme to protect people but those who participate in the warmer homes scheme will also receive a &euro;1,200 per year improvement.  This shows we have to make structural changes to help people who are in fuel poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The third element is to maintain the momentum that we are beginning to see in the context of getting people to retrofit their homes and to buy electric vehicles, and getting the electricity system to switch to renewable power.  In 2020, the spend on retrofitting will be four times what it was in 2016.  There will be a significant ramp-up in the investment we make, which is a significant part of the journey.  The purchase of electric vehicles this year and next year will be 12 times what it was in 2016.  We are beginning to see a serious penetration of electric vehicles and we are building out a charging network with the resources being made available.  What is also significant next year is that we will have an auction for renewable energy on the grid and this will represent a 60% increase in the amount of renewable energy on the grid in one auction, which is a significant expansion.  This is providing momentum behind the climate action plan.<\/p>  <p>  I want to conclude by addressing the issue of just transition.  We face serious threats in respect of the midlands.  I thank the Minister for Finance for the constructive way in which he has approached this.  We are in a position to plan between the special aggregated model of retrofitting that we will have in the midlands and the additional allocation of funds to allow the National Parks and Wildlife Service to restore bogs and create employment opportunities, while there is also Bord na Mona itself and its capacity to diversify.  With the just transition fund of &euro;6 million, we will, through a just transition commissioner, work with communities in the midlands to ensure that we respond in appropriate ways.  I would also draw attention to the fact that in the national development plan we set aside &euro;1 billion for an urban fund, &euro;1 billion for a rural fund and &euro;500 million for a climate action fund.  All of these funds are dedicated to the journey to a low-carbon economy.  I believe that by working with interests in the midlands, we can exploit those funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000025#X00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1570711200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Budget 2020 represents another significant and visible commitment to children and families by this Government and I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the budget, the fourth I have been involved in as Minister and the fourth that is progressive, where the poorest have gained proportionately more than the richest.<\/p>  <p>  We continue to provide additional resources to meet the needs of some of the most vulnerable people.  I particularly welcome the increases in the expansion of the one-parent family payment and jobseekers' transition payments, and the increase to the living alone allowance.  These changes, and other measures, will improve the lives of many of our citizens, even while we are making every effort to ready ourselves for a potential no-deal Brexit and the difficulties this would cause for so many people and businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I now turn to the budget 2020 provisions for my own Department.  I am especially pleased to advise the House that the gross funding being made available to my Department in 2020 will be &euro;1.604 billion, which represents an increase of 6% over its allocation for 2019.  Approximately half of that funding is targeted at public services to protect our children and to provide for their welfare, and the other significant portion is to continue the journey to build an accessible, affordable and high quality childcare system.<\/p>  <p>  In a few weeks, we will launch the new national childcare scheme, sometimes referred to as the NCS.  In March, I signalled a target timeframe of 29 October for the launch.  The IT system has been built and is being piloted at the moment.  It is the objective of any pilot to identify any snags and a minor snag has been identified, which means the scheme will now open for applications in November.  Payments to parents, as I have previously advised, will still flow from November.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the NCS is a landmark moment for making high quality childcare more affordable and more accessible to families.  As many in this House will be aware, since I became Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, my ambition has been to move Ireland from being one of the most expensive countries in the world for childcare to being one of the best.  This ambition has focused on three strands - quality, affordability and accessibility - and budget 2020 moves us another step on that journey.<\/p>  <p>  I have allocated an additional &euro;54.5 million to childcare for 2020.  This brings the budget to &euro;628 million per annum and represents a 9.3% increase over the 2019 allocation and a 138% increase since 2014.  It is a substantive investment that will deliver significant changes.  Taking time to pick up and drop off children while commuting to work, and then doing a day's work, is stressful and this is especially true in a lone-parent family.  From September 2020, therefore, all parents will be able to avail of an additional five hours of subsidised childcare, whether working or studying.<\/p><p>Budget 2020 has also allowed me to increase by 25% the funding available for preschool access for children who need targeted supports under the access and inclusion model, AIM.  This is an incredibly important programme.  It provides a range of measures to support children with disabilities to take part in the ECCE free preschool programme in mainstream settings and to help make preschool services more inclusive, benefiting all children in those services.<\/p> <p> Another key area of my Department's responsibility is Tusla.  I strongly support Tusla's important work in protecting some of the most vulnerable children and families in our increasingly complex and diverse society.  These additional resources secured are necessary to deliver on a significant programme of service reform and have also allowed for targeted development of key service areas.<\/p> <p> I was delighted yesterday morning to meet some of the young protestors from Extinction Rebellion on Merrion Square.  We have a long way to go to reduce Ireland's emissions, but the increase in carbon tax, to which the Minister, Deputy Bruton, referred, will allow us invest more in our just transition agenda.  Every budget from now on must focus on climate justice, and our young protestors, and all of society, must be involved in contributing to a just transition to a low-carbon future.<\/p> <p> Budget negotiations are by their nature tough and there are many competing demands, but I welcome the recognition that the measures I have put forward to reduce poverty, protect and support the vulnerable and support families must be addressed.  I commend budget 2020 to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000025#X00500","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570711800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>In May 2016, I had the great honour of being appointed Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, the first such Minister of State to sit at the Cabinet table.  Not only did I consider it an honour but I also viewed it as a challenge.  I set myself three goals: to reform, to invest and to put the person with the disability at the centre of our thinking and planning.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to take the opportunity to highlight one of those areas, namely investment, without which we will struggle to reform.  In my three years as Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, I have secured additional funding of more than &euro;500 million for disability issues.  This is a figure one will not hear from the Opposition or in our national media.  This has not been easy in the context of many other competing priorities across government.  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  I am pleased to have been able both to build on significant existing resources and to obtain additional funding for disability services in the 2020 budget.  With these additional moneys, the overall budget for disability services in 2020 will be in excess of &euro;2 billion.  The increased level of funding in 2020 will enable us to continue to provide residential services to more than 8,600 people with disabilities at more than 1,240 locations.<\/p>  <p>  On taking office, one of my priorities was to ensure that all young adults leaving school or Rehab training would have access to supports and services that met their needs at one of the most crucial transition points in their lives.  Additional funding of &euro;13 million will provide supports and day services to approximately 1,600 young people with disabilities who leave school and training programmes next year.  I recognise the critical importance of respite for the loved ones and families of those with a disability.  I am pleased to confirm that an additional &euro;5 million will be provided in 2020 to build the capacity of our respite services in order that we can better respond to the changing needs of service users and their families.  In the coming weeks, I will open our 12th respite house in Naas, County Kildare.  Specifically, this funding will provide intensive support packages for children and young people in response to the changing needs of service users and their families.  This initiative will include intensive in-home visiting support, planned overnight, specialist behavioural support and extended day-weekend and day-based activities for families.  Sl&aacute;intecare is centred on providing services and supports at the lowest level of complexity.  An additional &euro;5 million in this budget is provided for emergency protocols to support people with disabilities who have high support needs.  This includes funding for emergency placements and the provision of intensive in-home support and respite packages, which are intended to delay the need for residential care for vulnerable service users.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;2 million will be provided in 2020 to support implementation of the autism plan, which includes a range of measures to improve services for people with autism and their families.  A 100% Christmas bonus will be paid to those on invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer's allowance, carer's benefit and domiciliary care allowance, to name but a few.  The carer's support grant of &euro;1,700, which we restored, will be paid in 2020 to more than 126,000 users.  In addition, the number of hours per week that carers can work outside the home will be increased from 15 to 18.5 from January 2020.  More than 1,200 carers are expected to benefit from this.  The blind welfare allowance will be exempt from the means assessment for social welfare schemes.  Some 12,000 housing adaptation grants will be provided at a cost of &euro;59 million to help people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The budget is about being person-centred, ensuring that the person with the disability and, where appropriate, his or her carer are to the forefront of our thinking and planning.  This budget, the fourth in which I have been involved as Minister of State, has demonstrated my commitment in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000026#Y00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1570711800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Against the background of Brexit uncertainty, it was vital that the Government framed a prudent budget for 2020.  I will focus on the key areas of my responsibility, namely forestry, horticulture, organics and the greyhound sector.<\/p>  <p>  The continued support for the development of forestry in Ireland is reinforced with an allocation of &euro;103 million, including a capital carryover, for 2020.  This allocation reflects our commitment to planting 8,000 ha in 2020, an ambitious target contained in the climate action plan.  This level of planting will be challenging and will require shared action from the private sector, public bodies and local communities, but the Government is committed to achieving it.  The budget also provides funding for the direct implementation of a number of other actions under the climate action plan, including the mobilisation of the private timber resource in Ireland, a substantial investment in forest roads, continued support for knowledge transfer groups and the promotion of timber products.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, funding for capital investment in the commercial horticulture sector was increased by &euro;1 million to &euro;6 million.  In response to continuing strong demand for investment by the sector, budget 2020 has maintained this allocation.  Ireland's horticulture faces a number of challenges in the context of Brexit; however, the sector still has significant potential for development.  Budget 2020 continues to provide significant resources to maximise the industry's competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  The greyhound sector has undergone a series of reforms in recent times, including the enactment of the Greyhound Racing Act 2019.  This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability.  I am pleased to announce the Government's commitment to the Horse and Greyhound Fund for 2020, which will maintain expenditure at &euro;16.8 million next year for Bord na gCon.  This sector is an important contributor to the economy and provides employment in both rural and urban areas.  A significant portion of the fund will be spent on care and welfare.  Bord na gCon has put in place a range of such initiatives for greyhounds in recent months.  I welcome the establishment of the care fund to fund programmes and initiatives for the care and welfare of racing greyhounds.  The fund will support a variety of initiatives in the area of rehoming, welfare, traceability and a greyhound injury support scheme.  I have received assurances from the board of Bord na gCon that it remains committed to the protection of the integrity of the industry and to promoting the welfare of greyhounds.  With this new legislation in place, together with the maintenance of the funding, I am confident that Bord na gCon will have the tools to reform and strengthen the industry.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for the organic farming scheme has been increased this year to &euro;12 million, with a further &euro;1.2 million provided for development of the organic sector.<\/p><p> The &euro;1 million increase in the organic scheme budget for 2020 highlights the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the development of the organic sector.  The higher targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, budget for 2020 will also directly benefit organic farmers as they are direct beneficiaries under this scheme for organic investments.  This will help build on the record volume of Irish land under organic production, which we have delivered under the current rural development programme.  This higher investment is key to the implementation of the strategy for the organic food sector for 2019 to 2025.<\/p> <p> I welcome the provision of an additional &euro;1 million to bring the 2020 allocation for Horse Sport Ireland to &euro;4 million to assist with the strategic development of the sector.  It is an area in which I have a personal interest.  This extra funding will assist in providing further incentives for breeding high-quality young horses and developing a structure for producers and breeders towards producing a horse from the foal stage to competing at high-level competition.  I am delighted that the &euro;850,000 under the equine infrastructures grant scheme could be maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000026#Y00300","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570712400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the budget, delivered by Fine Gael and supported by its colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, which has failed again to ease the burden on working families.  It is a takeaway budget rather than a giveaway.<\/p>  <p>  The budget could have been so much better for the people of rural Ireland and across this State by putting money back in people's pockets but it has failed to deliver.  It has failed to improve public services.  The Government failed to tackle the rip-off practices in childcare and car insurance, and it is still like the wild west in the rental sector.  Families in rural Ireland will face increased charges as a result.  The Government has decided to go against the poorest workers in the State by not providing even one cent of an increase in the national minimum wage.  Everyone expected something to be done for those on the minimum wage but that has not happened and action is being deferred until after Brexit.  I wonder who requested that?  There was no deferral of corporation tax or multimillionaires' income tax breaks until after Brexit.  Why are the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il only choosing to punish the lowest paid workers in our society?<\/p>  <p>  Some have called this a nothing budget but is more cruel than that.  Perhaps the meanest and most harmful decision made by the Government was the increase in the carbon tax.  That decision will hurt the poorest and most rural constituents.  It is not just Sinn F&eacute;in saying it, as many organisations that have analysed the budget have come to that conclusion.  That will push more people over the poverty line having to put up with the cold this winter.  The Government has said in its defence that the increase in carbon tax is on the grounds of climate action.  That does not hold up when we crunch the numbers as we have had a carbon tax for the past nine years and it has not had an impact on climate action.  Despite the fact that the Government has taken the decision to increase the carbon tax by an additional &euro;6 to a total of &euro;26 per tonne, only a fraction of this will be reinvested in climate action.<\/p>  <p>  The carbon tax is expected to bring in approximately &euro;540 million to &euro;550 million next year, based on budget figures, and yet only &euro;6 million has been allocated for a Bord na M&oacute;na transition plan.  If we ever needed proof of Fine Gael greenwashing, that is it.  What the Government intends to deliver to the people of the midlands in particular falls well short of anything substantial.  It is meagre and there is no vision.  I have not seen anything about creating a biomass supply chain industry required to supply the three midlands power stations or anything relating to biogas or microgeneration.  A miserly &euro;6 million has been allocated for bog rehabilitation while the greyhound industry got &euro;16 million.  Rural bogs have the potential to serve as carbon sinks, as well as educational and tourism resources, but that has been overlooked.  The current afforestation grant scheme is a joke and unfit for purpose.  It is also underfunded.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing in the budget for rural transport.  How can one expect people to use less fuel if we do not provide alternatives?  Are the people in counties Laois and Offaly meant to buy electric cars and install their own charging points?  Sinn F&eacute;in argued for almost a doubling of the rural transport budget.  We are trying to provide solutions but the reality is that this was not a giveaway budget but a takeaway budget.  Ordinary people, particularly those in rural Ireland, will be worse off after this budget.  We advocated measures to tackle rip-off insurance costs, increasing the minimum wage and &euro;10 million for the retraining of Bord na M&oacute;na workers, with funding to support the agriculture sector, especially in the face of Brexit.  As I mentioned, we would almost double the funding for local bus services but we would not have increased the carbon tax.  Ultimately, this budget will not work for working families or rural Ireland.  It will increase pressure on low-income families and people living in rural Ireland.  It is a missed opportunity by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000027#Z00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1570712400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>This budget has been a major disappointment for the vast majority of people who are struggling and are working hard to pay their mortgage or rent.  They may face an occasional crisis in life, whether it is a car or washing machine breaking down, but there is nothing in the budget for them.  The difficulty is there is no effort to recognise that a large section of people simply cannot survive in the system, as it stands.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus mainly on my portfolio of justice.  There was an exchange today in the Chamber about people extorting money by intimidating people working on building sites in Dublin.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh wrote to Ministers informing them of it but nothing was done.  Apart from the clear and obvious problem, it struck me that a Fine Gael Government that prides itself on being tough on crime did nothing when it was told about it.  Now we have a scandal.  I am sure the Minister of State knows that very many people who are victims of crime do not go to the Garda because they do not trust the Garda to solve those problems.  Why did the contractor in this case not go to the Garda and why did senior officials in Dublin City Council consider it appropriate to advise the contractor to co-operate with the criminal rather than go to the Garda and get it sorted out?  People clearly believe the Garda is not up for the job.  It is the experience of very many people the length and breadth of the country, including in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  Walking on the streets of Dublin any night of a weekend after midnight, one might search high and low without finding a garda.  They are not walking the streets or protecting people.  When people come out of pubs and try to get a taxi home, they are afraid of their lives if they have to hang around for very long.  I spoke to a woman the other day who told me she got off a bus in the north inner city one evening last week at approximately 7.30 p.m. and a car was doing doughnuts.  That was near Ballybough, where around the corner Fitzgibbon Street Garda station has been closed, with a hoarding around it, for the past four years.  Leinster House is 300 years old and there was a commitment to have it renovated; it was done in less time than was originally envisaged because of that commitment.  However, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, went to the north inner city and promised to do something, but what happened?  Fitzgibbon Street Garda station is still closed with the hoarding around it because there was no commitment to refurbish it.  It is the reality for many people around the country.<\/p>  <p>  It is a similar position in my constituency.  There are small rural towns with small gangs of people involved in the drug trade are attacking their neighbours and intimidating them.  The Garda simply is not up for the job.  I have seen this myself and spoken to people about it.  They found that when they went to the Garda, there was sympathy and the Garda members took a note before they were sent away.  No other effort was made because the Garda does not have the required resources unless there is a crisis.  An armed response unit has recently been placed in Cavan and now there are three of them in the Border region, which is welcome.  They are meant to respond to a crisis.  The problem is the resources are not there to avoid that crisis developing in the first place.  It is the major factor in discussing justice and so many other issues in the budget.  The resources have not been put in place to deal with problems.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has told us this is about making the right choice.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has said, he only has so much money.  The problem is the Government is prepared to make choices to benefit the people at the very top.<\/p><p>We still have tax breaks for executives from abroad living in Dublin.  We still have tax breaks for some people at some of the major international corporations here.  We still have a major tax breaks for the banks.  AIB and Bank of Ireland are making more than &euro;1 billion per year but are paying no tax.  The Minister of State should tell publicans in rural Ireland that they can pay no tax because they have made no money in recent years.  That is the excuse the banks make.  Would that wash?  Bloody sure it would not wash, but this Government allowed it to happen for the banks.  These same banks have absolutely persecuted people throughout the country.  They are driving people to the road in many cases and evicting them, yet we are doing this.<br\/><br\/>Some weeks ago, I picked up a book I read many years ago called <i>The Republic<\/i>, which was written by Plato 2,000 years ago.  It states that three things are vital for a state to survive, namely, an adequate justice system, an adequate health system and an adequate education system.  If we think of it, all the other things we have are subsidiaries of those three things, yet we are not dealing with those central issues in our society in this day and age.  It is a scandal that this Government continues to hide behind numbers by saying Brexit is coming or that it only has so much money.  There is every excuse but there is no excuse for the unfortunate people who feel afraid in their homes because of the situation in this city and throughout rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000027#Z00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570713000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>As the party spokesperson on children and youth affairs, I will focus on that area of the budget initially and then will raise some other points.<\/p>  <p>  While some of the parts of the children and youth affairs budget are welcome, unfortunately it was lacking in many other areas, especially in the detail on the early years and childcare sector.  We need a radical new approach for the early years childcare sector.  The current system is broken and completely unsustainable for staff.  It is also financially crippling for thousands of parents.  Families are being squeezed every which way through unaffordable rents and mortgages.  We have a high cost of living and childcare costs that amount to a second mortgage or a second rent in some instances.<\/p>  <p>  In our alternative budget, which was published on 1 October, one of the points we made was that we would commence a five-year programme of reform to ensure that early years and childcare staff are properly paid.  That is absolutely crucial to the sector.  We also need to see a slashing of fees for parents, which also was part of our proposal.  It would cost &euro;28 million in the first year and the full-year cost would be &euro;85 million.  Our proposals would reduce fees throughout the State for parents significantly over a five-year period, starting with a reduction of 13%.  The reduction would increase to 66% by the end of the fifth year.  The initial 13% reduction would amount to approximately &euro;100 per month on a monthly cr&egrave;che fee of &euro;800.<\/p>  <p>  We would also introduce a proper pay scale for all workers in the sector, staring with the current living wage of &euro;12.30.  This would increase year upon year over a five-year period for all staff across the entire childcare and early years sector.  This is something we have long advocated.  It is an issue about which I feel especially passionate.  In 2017 I was involved in a report at committee level.  We brought forward a motion about the wages and the terms and conditions in the sector.  It is frustrating that although Deputies and Senators from all parties, as well as Independent Members and everyone else, recently were getting their picture taken at a launch by SIPTU about the terms and conditions for workers and their wages, we have a budget that completely failed to deliver on that commitment.  Workers need to be financially supported and encouraged to upskill and remain in the sector.  At the moment we are seeing burnout and people are not staying in the sector.  That is causing major issues because there will be a staffing crisis.  As with everything in this country, it has to get to a crisis before anyone starts to pay attention.<\/p>  <p>  As it stands, the market model that we have for the childcare and early years sector risks being reduced to businesses designed solely for profit.  We have all seen the revelations over the summer relating to the Hyde and Seek cr&egrave;che reported by the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  We all know how horrifying that was and how horrible it was to watch.  The reality is that if we do not address the issue of fees for parents, as well as terms and conditions and proper decent wages for workers, then the problem is basically going to continue.  There is no point in saying anything different.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to touch on the allocation for Tusla.  No detail has been given on the number of social workers, aftercare workers or administrative workers will be put into place to relieve the administrative burden on social workers.  There are no numbers whatsoever.  A Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report was published last week specifically relating to the Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary areas.  It showed a major percentage of children who had no social workers.  HIQA did an investigation on the issue.  Many children were only appointed a social worker one or two months prior to the investigation.  There are major issues in that part of the country, yet the budget does not say how many new social workers will be appointed.  That makes me think the money they are talking about simply will go to plug the current gaps in the system and is not actual new money.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention an issue about housing.  It is one of the biggest issues that almost all Deputies deal with in their constituencies.  We have become totally desensitised to the homeless situation.  It has become normal.  That is the only conclusion that I can come to in respect of homelessness.  We talk about it so often here, yet absolutely nothing constructive is being done.  The Good Shepherd Centre for the homeless in Kilkenny announced yesterday that there was no new money in this budget for the centre.  It is doing fantastic work, as do other places both in my constituency and throughout the country, but no additional help is being given to it.<\/p>  <p>  The school completion programme also falls within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It specifically focuses on the needs of the child.  It is in place in certain schools and not every school has it.  It provides counselling, play therapy, homework clubs and many services for children who are seen to be potentially at risk of dropping out of school.  There is no new money for the programme.  Its funding has been cut since 2008 and it operates on a shoestring budget.  Those involved operate a great service, yet in a few years' time when it closes down because of the lack of money, everyone will be here throwing their hands up and asking how we let that happen.  We let it happen because we are not putting the money into the services.  That is what happens.  It is as my colleague has said: it is about political choice and whether we want to help people who are currently struggling or whether we want to keep rewarding the people at the top.  I think we have seen this Government for enough years to know exactly where its priorities lie.<\/p>  <p>  That last point I want to make relates to the carbon tax.  There obviously are urban areas where I live but we have many rural areas and there is no public transport.  I drive here every day because that is the only choice I have.  The last train that goes to my home town is at 6.25 p.m.  As we all know, the House often sits far longer than that.  People do not have the choice to use public transport.  The Government cannot penalise them with a carbon tax if they do not have that choice.  It is fine if they have the choice of public transport but we do not have that choice in so many areas.  It is cruel.  A significant number of people are already panicking over the carbon tax.  People do not know how they are going to pay for coal and oil.<\/p>  <p>  They do not have the option of changing to newer heating systems.  They do not have the money.  Currently, they barely make ends meet.  Many families every week must choose between paying the heating bill or the electricity bill.  That is the reality.  If the Minister of State does not believe that is the reality, he should go out to some of the constituencies and talk to people.  Their reaction since Tuesday and the announcement of the carbon tax is telling.  People say they will cut back on this or that or something else in order that they can afford the heating as we come into winter.  It is totally unacceptable that we are allowing that to happen in this day and age.  We are being told that everyone needs to upgrade to electric cars.  That is great.  Is the Government going to subsidise all these cars for people?  That is not the reality for most people.  They cannot afford to make those changes.  We cannot penalise someone who does not have the option.  That is exactly what this tax is doing.  It is a fast revenue-raising measure.  It is not anything to do with the environment or climate change.  That is the last point I will make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000028#AA00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1570713000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is next, and he will be sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000028#AA00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1570713000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Canney, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, and Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000028#AA00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1570713000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is a measure of the Government's commitment to capital investment that the capital budget for my Department has increased by &euro;357 million despite the difficult challenges created by Brexit.  It will allow my Department to continue to finance core priorities and address short and long-term needs that fall within its remit.<\/p><p>Beyond the immediate impacts of Brexit, one of the most important challenges facing us is reducing excess carbon dioxide emissions which are the main cause of climate change.  One of the keys to tackling excess emissions is the development of sustainable public transport to provide the option, wherever possible, for car users to leave their cars at home.  As a result, 37% of the budget this year is devoted to public transport, an increase of &euro;235 million on the figure for last year.  It brings total investment in public transport in both current and capital expenditure to over &euro;1 billion for the first time.  We will commence building the national train control centre, continue to invest heavily in rail maintenance to improve intercity rail services, station accessibility and invest &euro;80 million to support enhanced walking and cycling facilities across all major urban centres.  We will continue to support fleet operators via the PSO system, incentivising passengers to switch to public transport by ensuring fares remain competitive.  We will support continued investment in greenways, with a 21% increase in funding.  In Dublin the budget will support progress on two major infrastructural projects, namely, BusConnects and MetroLink.  It will also allow us to commence the transition to hybrid vehicles in the Dublin Bus fleet and assist in delivering on the commitment to provide 200 km of mostly segregated cycle lanes as part of the BusConnects project. <\/p> <p> I recognise that transitioning to a low carbon economy will take time as it is the biggest industrial transformation in our lifetime.  I do not want to lose sight of the vital and traditional importance of the road network in the daily lives of citizens and commuters, particularly outside urban areas.  As a result, we will invest &euro;1.12 billion in roads, including the N5, Westport to Turlough, road; the N22, Ballyvourney to Macroom, road; the Dunkettle interchange and the Listowel and Moycullen bypasses.  Additionally, my Department is investing &euro;1.5 million in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, with funds ring fenced from carbon tax revenues.  <\/p> <p> In 2020 we will invest &euro;125 million in sport and &euro;186 million in tourism.  We have secured funding to support the qualifying teams for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, the hosting of four matches in the Euro 2020 championships next June and commence preparations to host the Ryder Cup in 2026.  As the full impacts of Brexit are likely to make themselves felt in 2020, we have secured a commitment to a significant package of up to &euro;40 million to support a wide range of measures that will be undertaken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  It will help to ensure we continue to have a strong and positive presence in international tourism markets.  <\/p> <p> Since the formation of the Government in May 2016, the overall departmental budget has increased from &euro;1.7 billion to &euro;2.7 billion, with 87% of the increase represented by Project Ireland 2040 investment.  It enhances the value of capital stock in the country and addresses vital infrastructure requirements, improving our standard of living and international competitiveness.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is proud of the fact that the portfolio has been given such prominence and priority by the Government.  <\/p> <p> The Independent Alliance supports the prudent approach taken to the budget.  However, this approach does not mean that those who are more vulnerable have been neglected.  It is welcome that many more people will be eligible for medical cards as a result of measures taken in the budget, at the encouragement and urging of the Independent Alliance.  I also acknowledge the willingness of the Minister for Finance to increase the threshold for inheritance tax by &euro;15,000 for the second year in a row.  This is part of a trend linked with a pledge in the programme for Government which holds that people, particularly those on modest incomes, should be able to leave their houses to their children in certain circumstances.  We are not talking about particularly affluent people, with the amount in question increasing to approximately &euro;335,000.  Inheritance tax is something that adversely affects people with various assets, particularly those whose sole asset is the family home.  They will now be relieved of some of the burden borne heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000028#AA00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570713600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>In the area of local government the funding announced in the budget on Tuesday amounts to &euro;156 million paid directly by the local government section into the local authority structure throughout the country, in which there are 31 local authorities.  The local government fund supports a range of local government initiatives and services across the country, with which Members of this House will be familiar.  I am delighted with the increase in support of &euro;12.5 million for capital investment in fire and emergency services.  This money will be used to provide vital new fire service vehicles and refurbish existing fire stations.  I also welcome the increased capital funding of &euro;2.4 million for the Valuation Office which will go towards its 2020 IT systems upgrade project.  The Government has made &euro;17 million available to Ordnance Survey Ireland for 2020, an increase of &euro;2 million on the figure for last year.  It will allow the office to develop geo-spatial activities in support of Government policy and strategy, thus allowing it to take on additional public sector tasks in 2021 and 2022.  Thanks to these important supports, I am confident that the local government sector and the Tailte &Eacute;ireann group of agencies will be strongly resourced into 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the variation decisions made by local authorities recently, the 2020 LPT allocations amount to &euro;516.8 million, compared to &euro;503 million in 2019.  A total of 19 local authorities varied their LPT rates upwards for 2020, providing &euro;19.7 million in additional LPT income for their own use.  This compares to a gain of &euro;3.4 million in 2019 for the same authorities.  This trend illustrates that the majority of local authorities are now prepared to use the LPT variation mechanism to generate additional funding locally for critical and strategic programmes and services. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018 the commercial rates collected by each local authority across the country amounted to just short of &euro;1.4 billion, a very significant sum which is the largest funding stream for local authorities across the country.  Income raised in 2018 by local authorities through development levies amounted to &euro;222 million.  I have already given the figure for LPT income.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of other provisions made by the local government section for local authorities across the country, &euro;9 million has been allocated under what are termed miscellaneous schemes, including funding for European Committee of the Regions membership, which comprises eight full members and eight substitute members.  These are county councillors from all across the country who sit on that EU-wide body.  Funding is also provided for the National Oversight and Audit Committee which was established in 2014 to ensure the efficient application of resources by each local authority across the country.  There is also an allocation for local partnership initiatives and local government development initiatives.  In recent years we have also made allocations related to the participation of women in public office at local government level and those funds are derived from the miscellaneous schemes.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of the broader budget, we live in extremely interesting times.  We are still awaiting clarity on the outcome of the Brexit process, but the position in which the Government found itself in drafting a budget was such that prudence was deemed to be the most appropriate course in the allocation of resources.  However, I particularly welcome the increased funding for home help hours, an issue every Member of this House has come across in the course of his or her constituency work.  Home help support is crucial in ensuring older people can remain in their homes and communities for longer.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, on the extra allocation in that regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000029#BB00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1570713600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I want to speak about the budget from the perspective of an independent rural Deputy.  I begin by speaking about my role in the Departments of Rural and Community Development and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I welcome the allocation of &euro;190 million for the national broadband plan in 2020.  This is a clear indication of the Government's intention to get the plan in place.<\/p><p>It will get the 1.1 million people, including farmers and small businesses, who do not have broadband back on track and bring them into the digital age, ensuring no one is left behind.  The &euro;8 million fund for the digital skills initiative will provide for 25,000 citizens and SMEs to be upskilled to ensure they are ready for digitalisation.  As a rural Deputy, I am aware of the sporadic roll-out of broadband in rural areas and how some people are left behind or left out for no apparent reason.  The private sector has failed to provide for such people.  The national broadband plan is the only way it will be done.<\/p> <p> On climate action, the biggest measure is the &euro;146 million, an increase of &euro;29 million, made available to upgrade 24,000 homes and businesses.  There are several positive aspects to this initiative, foremost among which is the fact that it will lead to people living in comfortable houses and having to spend less on energy.  The average saving per household will be in the region of &euro;1,200 per annum once the upgrades are completed.  It is important that it is carried out.  A new retrofitting model will deliver upgrades to a large number of houses at the same time such that we create economies of scale to reduce costs and get more for the money we spend.  Another important measure is that those in fuel poverty or in receipt of fuel allowance will receive a grant to cover 100% of the cost of the upgrades, which is vital.<\/p> <p> On rural and community development, the increase of &euro;17 million in funding has been a major success, as &euro;10 million of it will be added to the LEADER fund.  Every Deputy is aware of the importance of the LEADER programme, its impact on community facilities and engagement and that it creates spaces where people can live, work, enjoy life and have an equal opportunity to that enjoyed by those who live in more updated urban areas.  The allocation is to be welcomed.  In addition, there is a &euro;3 million package of targeted supports for the community and voluntary sector.  As Members are aware, the voluntary sector is vital and we need to continue to support it.  I look forward to the publication of the volunteering strategy on which we are working to supplement that.  Another significant measure for towns and villages in rural Ireland is the investment of an additional &euro;1 million in library services.  These supports are very important to rural Ireland and, most importantly, will reach every citizen.<\/p> <p> It is important to point out that we have had to protect our most vulnerable in the context of the budget.  We are facing our biggest challenge since the founding of the State.  It is important that young people are being looked after and that care hours are being increased such that we can care for our most vulnerable people, who made the country what it is.  We must show respect for the elderly and provide care hours for them.<\/p> <p> I welcome the extension of the help to buy scheme, which assists young people who are trying to save to buy a home.  It is challenging to try to save a deposit while renting.  The help-to-buy scheme is vital for such people and I am delighted that it has been extended for two years.<\/p> <p> On education, I welcome that small rural schools will receive additional supports, including a better capitation grant, while those with four classrooms or fewer will be allocated a lower pupil-teacher ratio, which will help them in the fight to get additional teachers.<\/p> <p> I commend the budget to the House.  I am delighted and proud of what we have achieved in the prevailing difficult circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000029#BB00300","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570714200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on budget 2020.  For some time, Deputies have been aware of the Government's plan for a budget premised on a hard Brexit.  There has been much criticism of this approach but I believe it reinforces that Fine Gael takes a prudent approach to the public finances.  The twin themes of the budget, namely, Brexit and climate action, were well flagged in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The budget delivered for Offaly and the midlands.  Although there has been some negativity regarding the increase in the carbon tax, I am delighted that the funds it raises will be ring-fenced to protect the most vulnerable and invested in agri-environmental schemes and our low-carbon future.  I am pleased that my Government colleagues recognised the uniquely challenging impact of the country's decarbonisation transition on Offaly in the context of Bord na M&oacute;na's transition away from the harvesting of peat in order to generate power for the ESB.  I have had intense discussions with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, over the 12 months since Bord na M&oacute;na announced its decarbonisation strategy from brown to green.  I thank and acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in particular for his accessibility and responsiveness at all times, especially in recent months following the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on Shannonbridge and the uncertainty created as a result.  I emphasised the immediate need for the Government to respond with concrete measures and am delighted with the announcement that a just transition commissioner will be appointed shortly.  Engagement with all stakeholders, workers, companies, communities and local authorities, particularly Offaly County Council, will be vital to ensure correct usage of the &euro;6 million just transition fund targeted at the midlands to support retraining and reskilling of workers and to assist local communities and businesses adjust to the low-carbon transition.  Consultation with the structures in place in the midlands, including the midlands transition team, must take place on the best approach to target the funding.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;5 million for bog restoration and rehabilitation which will restore bogs to their natural habitat is particularly welcome.  Bord na M&oacute;na workers I recently visited were adamant they could carry out this work.  Although I understand that the programme will support the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I sincerely hope a role will be found for these workers, especially those who are not at retirement age but are not young enough to wish to retrain or go into further education.  The recently announced forestry planting collaboration by Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte will provides further opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na workers and I hope that is explored. <\/p>  <p> The allocation of &euro;20 million to deliver group housing retrofitting as set out in the climate action plan is a welcome development.  I understand it is to be targeted at the midlands.  I suggest, as I previously suggested to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the House, that Offaly be prioritised as it is the county that will be impacted on most by decarbonisation.  These measures will make a significant difference in my constituency by generating economic activity and creating environmentally sustainable jobs to replace those lost in the short term at Bord na M&oacute;na.  I welcome the fact that people in fuel poverty will be taken into consideration and that funding from the carbon tax will be used to increase the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week.  I also welcome the additional &euro;13 million which will be ring fenced from that money to support the warmer homes scheme and will be targeted at energy-efficient upgrades for those at risk of fuel poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is not and never has been sufficiently funded.  Even though its funding was increased in the budget, it is still not sufficient.  We use the arts to sell the country around the globe.  The work being done by the Heritage Council is brilliant and should have received more funding.  That said, I welcome the much-needed increase of &euro;1 million for special areas of conservation or special protection areas.  Farmers are operating under significant constraints in my area.  It is a start.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of an additional 1 million home help hours is a start and will be a tremendous asset to carers and others in that role.  I acknowledge the additional funding for tourism and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I recognise the fantastic work being done by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The allocation of &euro;15 million to the Department will enable further investment in town and village renewal.  It is great news for rural Ireland.  I refer to the E-hive in Edenderry, County Offaly.  Is a new, modern co-working hub owned by Offaly County Council.  The project is at the centre of the town and is an illustration of how correctly-directed funding can be of significant benefit to rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000030#CC00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1570714200,"counter":384,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1570714800,"counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000031#DD00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1570714800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe - to discuss the study route of the M20 between Cork and Limerick; (2) Deputy Joan Burton - to discuss the future of Huntstown community centre in Dublin 15, which is in need of essential fire safety and structural remedial works; (3) Deputy Bernard J.

As this is the first budget since the declaration of a climate and biodiversity emergency, the Government will equally be judged on the priority it gives to taking action in face of this defining challenge.  This is clear from the major protests taking place outside this House today.  We have had many such protests in the past and I suspect we will have more of them in the future.  The budget has not moved Ireland from laggard to leader on climate action.  This was dubbed a climate budget.  The Minister called it \"a watershed moment\".  Ireland's laggard status stems from Fine Gael's decision to abandon the climate legislation proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party when we were in government together.  Subsequently, the Government failed to introduce any sort of coherent climate plan until this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a long way to go.  The State will have to pay millions of euro for failing to meet its EU 2020 climate commitments.  Our 2030 targets are at significant risk, even at this stage.  This budget is very much the start and not the finishing line when it comes to climate and biodiversity loss.  The Government has merely started facing in the right direction.  Its decision to focus on climate action, energy poverty and just transition is years overdue.  Carbon taxation is a small subset of overall climate action.  Responsibility for climate leadership cannot be regarded as resting with individuals.  As the carbon tax trajectory increases, it is vital that we see an increasing and urgent delivery of transparent and progressive measures in accordance with the landmark report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  In this context, I call on the Minister to commit to enacting before the next election the necessary legislation to introduce a net zero target by 2050 and to ensure improved accountability across the Government.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be clear that from a strict climate perspective, the &euro;6 per tonne increase in the rate of carbon tax is relatively modest.  It is the first increase in years.  Following the excellent work of the joint committee, which achieved a consensus across a majority of its members, it is important that citizens, businesses and stakeholders are clear that we are moving towards a carbon price of &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  We welcome the Government's decision to support Fianna F&aacute;il's approach to new revenues raised by the increase in carbon taxes.  Such revenues will be ring-fenced to pay for climate action measures and ensure vulnerable households are better protected.  Perhaps it would have been more sensible if the Government, having placed such weight on consensus at the joint committee, acknowledged that this approach to the use of these revenues was not its own.  The Taoiseach seems to be taking full responsibility for this policy approach.  Up to a number of days ago, he had a completely different idea on how the moneys collected from the carbon tax would be spent.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is mindful of the impact of the carbon tax increase on low-income households and on people who are at risk of fuel poverty, particularly those in rural areas who might not always have ready alternatives.  I appreciate and commend the expert analysis of the ESRI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, both of which made important inputs at the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  If we are to ensure the Government's approach to decarbonisation is rooted in climate justice, such independent and transparent assessment must continue.  It is concerning that the Government failed to produce a review of energy poverty prior to the carbon tax increase.  Such a review was demanded of it and was a requirement of the joint committee.  However, it is welcome that &euro;21 million has been allocated to the fuel allowance scheme to increase the weekly allowance by &euro;2 per week.  Given that we have a trajectory towards the &euro;80 per tonne price, it is important that we also see an increasing trajectory of support.  This, again, has to be the start; it must not be seen as the finish line.  The Government should be clear that the protection of the most vulnerable people is a first-order priority and will remain so throughout the introduction of additional protective measures.<\/p>  <p>  Ring-fencing is important because it provides transparency that moneys are being used specifically to support climate action on the ground.  It is important that we have additional investment for home insulation, particularly in the case of social housing.  We welcome the additional &euro;13 million that will be allocated to the warmer homes scheme to facilitate the retrofitting and insulation of the homes of people who are living in, or are at risk of, energy poverty.  It is important for the Government to come forward with detailed plans to ensure the SEAI is in position to assess applications and co-ordinate delivery in a timely manner.  We are clear that this is a small step.  We have not yet seen the sort of scaled-up investment that would allow for the delivery of a real national retrofitting programme.  Ring-fencing will also allow for additional investment in new electric vehicle charging infrastructure, cycling, peatlands rehabilitation and greenways, all of which are important elements of the joined-up approach to climate action.  It is particularly important that we get a transparent breakdown of the exact nature and level of the support for all of these activities.  We cannot have a repeat of the Government's climate plan, which was hot on announcements but cold on steps and on the funding to deliver them.<\/p>  <p>  The transition to a decarbonised society in Ireland must be made in a just and fair manner.  We need to be much more ambitious and responsive in helping the industries and communities affected by this transition.  A just transition is a key element of a climate justice approach.  A just transition means policies that are focused on providing security and opportunity to citizens.  A just transition model means new jobs, new industries, new skills and new investment.  Fianna F&aacute;il has placed particular importance on the need for a just transition, starting with the midlands.  We believe just transition measures must support regions where fossil fuels are being phased out, including the Moneypoint area.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not include in his Budget Statement any funding for the transition away from the burning of coal at Moneypoint.  Nevertheless, I am hopeful that he will recognise the merits of including Moneypoint in subsequent announcements this year.  The community there has suffered significantly.  Significant job losses have taken place and all of this is having a negative impact on spending in local communities.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned some of the initial steps that are recommended within the next six months.  The Government's response has been characterised by a refusal to engage.  We are, therefore, calling for the establishment of a just transition commissioner as soon as possible.  The just transition fund, which is a litmus test for how this Government supports communities that are highly dependent on fossil fuels, must be used to support other areas that will be affected by decarbonisation.  I have mentioned Moneypoint, which is relevant in this context.  As decarbonisation proceeds, I am sure there will be job losses in places where equipment is made, etc.  We need to be mindful of that.  The allocation of funding must be targeted and transparent to prevent the politicisation of grant making.  The major priorities for this funding are training and support for the affected communities and investment in retrofitting, renewables, community energy and public transport for rural areas.  There needs to be a focus on vulnerable and lower-income families at all times.<\/p>  <p>  I will move on to the area of communications.  Despite the fanfare with which the national broadband plan, NBP, was again announced in May, it was not even deemed worthy of mention in the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement.  The repeated claim that the project will start within weeks is simply no longer believable.  The Taoiseach said there will be another delay in the project because maps for the plan are covering areas already covered by other providers.  If just under half of the premises within the intervention area are covered by a commercial roll-out, as some people have claimed, this will be a major challenge and not a minor one.  What will happen if a broadband provider that is planning to roll out to the intervention area refuses to enter into a concession agreement with the Department but instead continues its roll-out?  What will happen if a challenge is made by a company that believes the State is supporting a company to compete unfairly with a commercial roll-out?  How long would rural broadband be delayed by such a case?  The &euro;119 million that is provided for in budget 2020 is less than the amount considered necessary for the provision of this service.  I have great reservations about when or if we will ever see broadband rolled out, notwithstanding the numerous announcements that have been made by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that the crisis in public service broadcasting will not be addressed by budget 2020.  While Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that some reforms will result from the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019, it appears that no concerted help is on the way for the public service broadcasting sector.  Some reforms of the licence fee are due in the coming months, but the fundamental challenge has not been tackled.  RT&Eacute; has made it clear that it is in a financial crisis.  I understand that it needs to do some restructuring but it must move beyond voluntary redundancy.  It is going to have to look at compulsory redundancy.  In return, the Government will have to put appropriate funding in place.<\/p><p>If we believe in the principle of public journalism and broadcasting, then we must pay for it.  The licence fee is not enough to meet that challenge and commercial advertising has collapsed.  We in the House have a responsibility to stand by independent journalism, protect democracy and not be in the say of the big conglomerates, which drive the social media agenda and have a negative impact on democracy through their failure to reduce or eliminate the fake news that circulates in those environments.  I would like to have seen money set aside for a digital safety commissioner, but the document does not seem to have any information whatsoever on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000031#DD00800","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570715400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to make some points on the budget.

I yearn for the day when the Government is out of office because the sentence which captures its performance is that the Cabinet sees itself as a group of non-executive directors.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is clearly on a lesser rate because he is only available a couple of days per month for work on behalf of the Government.

We need to be truthful with the people and tell them what is being cut.  The budget does not represent an increase.  The additional &euro;350 million is to keep existing projects going forward, but we can assume that no new projects will start because no money is available.  The Minister needs to outline which capital projects are now receiving lower allocations than previously indicated and what the knock-on effects of that will be to us as a nation.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing new in the budget in terms of public transport.  If anything, it appears that the allocation of capital funding and public transport projects are being delayed.  At the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts today, we had the benefit of hearing from the National Transport Authority, NTA, which was able to confirm to me that there will be no additional rail capacity at all for a minimum of two full years.  As things stand, there is no plan to provide additional budgets on rail routes.  Hard-pressed commuters who are being stuffed into carriages will not be facilitated with a comfortable journey to their destination.<\/p>  <p>  While we support the concept of embracing a carbon tax to encourage all of us to change our behaviour, what options do we have when the Government is telling us to use public transport but is not funding it or any additional capacity?  It is was clear from the meeting that the Minister is presiding over a public transport system that is already stuffed and will have no capacity for a further two years when, please God, he will be long gone from the Government benches.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly the Minister, in his non-executive role, said everything is a matter for everybody except him.  Under Bus &Eacute;ireann's commercial mandate, it is permitted by the Minister to fleece hard-pressed commuters who have already made the switch from cars to public transport.  People living in Dungarvan, County Waterford, who want to get the bus to work in Cork city will pay &euro;9 for an adult return ticket.  The bus travels through Youghal and their work colleagues who live there and will travel half of the journey will pay twice the price, that is, &euro;19 for a return ticket.  This is the kind of activity the Minister supports while enjoying photocalls.  He is much better than I could ever be at them but when it comes to the ground hurling, that is, the business of representing people on a daily basis and using the money that is available to his Department to provide value for money and the services we need, he is failing miserably.<\/p>  <p>  Even were 100% of the budget of &euro;520 million for the maintenance and construction of regional and local roads to go towards maintenance, which is highly unlikely, it falls far short of the Department's estimate of the cost of maintaining them.  A Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport analysis shows that about &euro;580 million is needed just to keep roads in an acceptable condition.  This does not account for the very considerable backlog of works in all counties that need to be carried out.  The latest National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, report on the condition of roads found that 70% had surface or structural difficulties, which is a significant health and safety concern.  <\/p>  <p>  On the sports side, there is no doubt that the number of photocalls and medal winning chasing, to which my colleague, Deputy Cowen, referred on budget day, will increase in the year ahead.  However, I am afraid that when it comes to supporting sport, the cupboard is bare.  He did a nice three-card trick in terms of reducing capital expenditure on sport for the next year and putting that money onto the current expenditure side to fund the photocalls for Euro 2020 and Tokyo 2020.  That is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul.  <\/p>  <p>  We have heard &euro;9 million has been allocated for greenways and new urban cycling projects.  As we are all aware, Fianna F&aacute;il proposed the use of carbon tax revenues to provide infrastructure to help people reduce their carbon emissions, but this money is coming from tourism.  What tangible action is the Minister taking to encourage people who can commute by cycling to do so?  What tax measures is he considering to try to get people onto ebikes?  Other countries which have successfully done this have schemes which write off up to 120% of the cost.  We have seen no suggestion of any initiative in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week, Fine Gael Senator Tim Lombard stated in a press release that 2020 allocates a total budget of around &euro;114 million for cycling compared with &euro;61 million last year.  Will the Minister, please, detail exactly how that increase has been brought about?  His Department's press release does not provide details of this funding increase.<\/p>  <p>  We support the diesel rebate scheme but there is concern among hauliers that despite the Minister's stated intentions in his budget speech that there will be full compensation for the haulage industry in the first year, the reality for the industry is that there is no such compensatory measures and the effective rebate rate will be reduced from 7.5 cent per litre to 5.8 cent per litre.  We will deal with the Finance Bill next week and I ask the Minister and the Government to outline in detail how the haulage industry is to be supported in the context of the rebate scheme?  According to the speech the other day, the industry is assuming a full compensatory write-off for it to be available.  How will that be achieved?<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the increase in tourism but the non-executive nature of the Minister, Deputy Ross, in that regard is very evident.  The numbers of tourists from the UK are down, with 80% of hoteliers telling us there are fewer visitors from the UK.  Research carried out by the Restaurant Association of Ireland found that tourists who come to Ireland are staying for fewer days and spending less money.  This is, of course, a concern.  The Chinese market comprises the people who spend the most internationally on tourism, a vast sum of &euro;277 billion per year.  That market is so important to the Minister that the tourism action plan 2019 to 2021 does not once mention China.<\/p><p> These are just some examples of the non-executive nature embraced by the Minister with regard to his role.  There is nothing in this budget that suggests anything other than that in his role as Minister, this man - this is not a personal attack - continues to reduce the level of tangible input he should have in an executive position on behalf of the people to improve people's lives.  In that regard, the transport budget is a failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000032#EE00400","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570716000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.   Once again, the Government is demonstrating its commitment to the Defence Forces by increasing defence spending year on year, providing more money pay and pensions and significantly increasing the capital investment in barracks, equipment and force protection.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provides an additional &euro;32.3 million towards our continual investment in the Defence Forces - people and infrastructure.  For the second successive year, I have secured more than &euro;1 billion for defence.  The overall total of &euro;1.04 billion includes &euro;780.4 million for Vote 36 - Defence, which is an increase of &euro;22.3 million on the 2019 provision.  <\/p>  <p>  As we have continuously recognised, recruitment and retention of our personnel have posed significant challenges for the Defence Forces.  It is for that reason the Government asked the independent Public Service Pay Commission to examine these issues in close detail.  Those recommendations have been accepted in full and will result in real and tangible benefits to our soldiers, sailors and air crew.  The budget provides additional funding of &euro;15 million for increases due under the public service stability agreement 2018 to 2020, as well as the implementation of the recommendations of the commission.  The Government's commitment to actioning the report is underpinned by our implementation plan which sets out clear timelines and objectives, providing a detailed and ambitious road map to strengthening the Defence Forces.  Among the measures being worked on is a review of technical pay grades 2 to 6 for specialists, with an initial focus on certain pinch points in the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  The Government's approach ensures that, once again, defence remains fully funded for the established strength of 9,500 personnel at pay rates set through long-established processes and negotiated agreements.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise the decision of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, to accept the Public Service Pay Commission's recommendations and can confirm that the increases in allowances will begin to be paid to its members in the coming weeks.  The Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, is considering the commission's recommendations and I hope it will view positively the proposals, together with our implementation plan, in order that the increases will be paid to its members as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  We will provide &euro;259.1 million for Defence Forces pensions, an increase of &euro;10 million, ensuring sufficient funding to meet the retirement benefits of some 12,640 former members and their dependants.  The Government's commitment to defence is further demonstrated by the significant capital envelope in 2020.  The capital allocation will increase by &euro;7 million to &euro;113 million in 2020.  The overall capital allocation tor 2018 to 2022 is &euro;541 million.  This will provide funding for a range of projects, including the continued mid-life upgrade of armoured personnel carriers; the purchase of three new utility aircraft, which are scheduled for delivery in 2020; the replacement of two maritime patrol aircraft, the tender process for which is nearing completion; a mid-life refit of two Naval Service vessels; and &euro;19 million for building projects with a further &euro;9 million for ongoing maintenance and running costs.  <\/p>  <p>  We are also providing more than &euro;2 million for the Reserve Defence Force.  The Defence group Votes also include over &euro;4 million for civil defence supporting the excellent work of volunteers and civil defence officers across the country.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, I have secured increases in Defence Votes of more than &euro;134 million or 15%.  These increases have allowed us to increase starting pay for three star privates from &euro;21,800 when I was appointed in 2016 to more than &euro;28,000 and implement outstanding adjudications, meaning &euro;50 per week more for Army rangers, &euro;13.52 for cooks, &euro;65.80 for certain account holders and a saving of &euro;43.63 for recruits and apprentices.  These are just some of the many improvements we have made in the past three and a half years.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to address the assertion that this equates to the &euro;32 million increase that I secured to an underspend in the pay subhead.  This House and the entire country knows that Fianna F&aacute;il has a reckless past when it comes to managing money.  Here we see another example of a party that is populist, that selectively ignores the reality of the public sector pay process and that simply does not understand public finances.  I thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for his work during the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000033#FF00200","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1570716000,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget which was prepared in the light of the difficult challenge facing the Government in the coming weeks, namely, the possibility of a hard Brexit.  From the perspective of my Department, it was important that the Minister announced a suite of supports for business, including repayable grants and lending schemes that will be available for deployment in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  These are targeted at supporting vulnerable but viable firms and build on the many supports introduced by the Government in the past three years.  It is noteworthy that they have been designed using the feedback of businesses and will ensure Irish enterprise is able to respond to the challenges that a no-deal Brexit presents.  This is an initial tranche of emergency funding that can be built upon as circumstances evolve in consultation with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  These supports will be critical in the highly vulnerable Border areas and in supporting exporters who are heavily exposed to the UK market.  Supports announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement include a rescue and restructuring fund of &euro;42 million, which is available to address the needs of firms in sectors with acute liquidity and other severe difficulties as a result of a disorderly Brexit.  The funding will be provided will be provided in the form of equity or loans through Enterprise Ireland and it will be available to eligible Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta clients as well as eligible non-agency clients.  A further transition fund of &euro;45 million will support businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector ranging from food and engineering firms to business process outsourcing firms.  It will help those businesses to adapt their business mode as needed and adjust to the new trading reality.  This fund will be delivered also through Enterprise Ireland and available to eligible Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta clients as well as eligible non-agency clients.<\/p>  <p>  Targeted supports for small and micro enterprises will also be essential to limit the impact of a disorderly Brexit.  In that regard, budget 2020 includes two related measures to support these businesses.  We will increase our funding to Microfinance Ireland to allow it to increase the amount that it can lend to microenterprises from &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000 over a two to five-year period at a very competitive rate.  Second, an emergency Brexit fund of &euro;5 million will be available for microenterprises by way of repayable grants available through the local enterprise offices, LEOs, of up to &euro;50,000.  Such qualifying enterprises will have recourse to Microfinance Ireland where they can receive up to &euro;50,000 in loans over a two to five-year period and if required, could avail of a further &euro;50,000 in a repayable grant from their local enterprise office.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also introducing a transformation fund of &euro;8 million to be administered by Enterprise Ireland.  It is a grant scheme supporting larger indigenous firms to transform their business to develop new products and processes, to remain competitive and to assist in diversifying to new markets.  There will be initial funding of &euro;5 million for primary food processing companies and &euro;3 million for non-food companies, for example, in traditional engineering sectors.  Additional funding for food transformation is also being made available through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  <\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the taxation measures announced by the Minister for Finance specifically targeted at SMEs, including significant changes to the research and development tax credit, particularly for small and micro firms which will be able to claim a higher rate of credit of 30% and will have improved options with regard to claiming the payable credit.  These firms will also be able to claim the credit for expenditure incurred in advance of commencing to trade.<\/p><p>Changes to the research and development tax credit scheme will help enterprises on their innovation journey and increase their productivity, which will be a key focus of the Future Jobs Ireland agenda.<\/p> <p> I wish to be clear that the Government is determined to plan ahead and prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, notwithstanding Brexit and other international challenges such as trade wars.  This is evident in recent announcements on other significant funding initiatives such as the regional enterprise development fund, the disruptive technology innovation fund and, most recently, the &euro;2.5 million competitive fund for the local enterprise offices.  All of the measures announced will ensure micro-enterprises and SMEs in every region can be prepared as soon as possible for a disorderly Brexit.  They will be on the ball.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000033#FF00300","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570716600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I want to address the care of people in our society, particularly those in need of homecare packages and support.  I welcome the increase in the budget of 1 million care hours, which will make a significant difference to many families.  However, it does not go far enough.  A number of people could not receive homecare packages where I live in County Louth.  At the end of July, there were 588 people waiting for homecare packages in community health organisation, CHO, 8, which comprises counties Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Louth and Meath.  Of those, over 100 had been clinically discharged from hospital but were unable to go home.  I refer to Hannah Donnelly, a young woman has been mentioned in this House before and is close to the hearts of the people of Drogheda because they know and support her and her family.  She has significant medical needs.  On 5 September her family were told that a homecare support package of four hours per week had been approved, but a business case had also been received and accepted.  While the HSE realised the importance of reuniting Hannah with her family in a medically supportive environment, it stated it did not have the resources to approve the package.  She needs 24\/7 care which she is receiving in a hospital bed, but she needs to be at home.  It is not good enough and not enough is being done about it.<\/p>  <p>  HSE statistics which were released to me in reply to a parliamentary question show that County Meath has the longest waiting list in its CHO area.  There were more people waiting for homecare packages in County Meath on 31 July than there were in counties Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath and Louth combined.  There is something very wrong in that regard.  I welcome and support the analysis of the Home Care Coalition which highlights that where someone lives can determine what care he or she will receive.  It is geographical and people in County Meath are being treated unfairly.  I am particularly supportive of Sage Advocacy, ALONE, Sean Moynihan and all carers throughout the country.  A commitment was given in the past to statutory homecare provision which I welcomed, but I did not see it mentioned in the Budget Statement.  I have no doubt that the commitment is still in place, but I would like the Minister to reiterate it and continue to increase the hours available.<\/p>  <p>  The problem of delayed discharges is not just about not getting a homecare package; in some cases there is also a lack of qualified staff to help people.  The State and the HSE need to get more people working in homecare.  One of my constituents has been clinically discharged, they but cannot find a skilled person who is available to meet their special homecare needs.  I suggest the Government look into opening up special homecare training or upskilling courses in regional colleges or local educational facilities.  People who choose to take such courses could be paid a wage on commencing their training in order to minimise the number of delayed discharges, particularly for elderly persons.  The majority of those waiting for homecare packages in my area are aged over 65 years.  Some might regard them as being in the autumn of their lives and they should be able to go home to spend the important months or years they might have left.  Home is where their heart is, with their family and the people who love them.  Keeping them in a clinical institution such as a hospital is not good for them or their families and does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  The budget has achieved many good things.  It has increased homecare provision, but it is my firm belief it does not go far enough.  I urge people to continue to campaign and put pressure on all of us, including me and Ministers.   We all come and go in this House, but the pain of those who cannot get home or the care they need is entirely unacceptable.  We must resist the bureaucracy and red tape that prevents them from receiving that care.  There are too many bean-counters in the HSE and not enough people who care enough to find the money.  When they have to make cuts, they should make them in their offices, rather than among their front-line staff who are not being looked after properly and need to be paid more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000034#GG00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1570716600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I welcome the budget which was put forward by the Minister for Finance in the House on Tuesday.  I will focus on one significant aspect of the budget for County Clare and the mid-west and west.  I particularly welcome the establishment of a new fund which will secure new routes for regional airports, including Shannon and Cork, Brexit or no Brexit.  The new fund consists of &euro;10 million over three years which will enable airports to secure new strategic routes.  I have previously raised this matter with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Taoiseach, Shannon Group and the chambers of commerce in Ennis, Shannon, Galway and Limerick.  There is an onus on the management of Shannon Airport to take full advantage of the newly established route development fund.  The measure announced in the budget could play a major role in the establishment of a vital connection from Shannon to Frankfurt which could potentially provide a &euro;412 million boost for the mid-west and west.  We cannot afford to let this opportunity slip.  Shannon Group has a duty to ensure the airport will receive the full benefit of this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Limerick Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with Ennis, Shannon and Galway chambers of commerce, commissioned a worthwhile report which assessed aviation policy as a driver of economic activity in the west and mid-west.  One of its recommendations was the establishment of a fund such as the one to which I have referred.  Much of the groundwork to establish the new strategic route from Shannon to Frankfurt has already been done, following the publication of another major report from the Danish international consultancy group Copenhagen Economics which concludes that aviation and enterprise policy must be linked if the Government is to deliver on its policy of achieving balanced regional development.<\/p>  <p>  Shannon Airport adds &euro;306 billion to Ireland's GDP and supports 43,700 jobs.  Approximately 1.7 million passengers travel through it every year on 13,000 flights.  This implies that at peak times, only 45% of the airport's capacity is being utilised.  The spare capacity offers untapped potential to deliver balanced regional development without requiring new investments.  It could also alleviate the pressure on Dublin and reduce the need for costly infrastructural spending.  The Copenhagen Economics report also concludes that the establishment of a frequent route between Shannon and Frankfurt Airport, with two flights every weekday and one flight at the weekend, would generate an additional &euro;412 million in GDP.  The Government might support this route as part of its implementation of the regional spatial and economic strategy for the southern region, in which international financial services are an integral part of the smart specialisation and clustering strategy.  Strengthening this connection and making it international via a new route to Frankfurt would complement the financial clusters in the west and mid-west, thus ensuring the sustainability of the route in the long term.  The Copenhagen Economics report recommends a range of governmental supports and interventions amid concerns about the regional impact and dominance of Dublin Airport at the expense of other airports.<\/p>  <p>  Passenger numbers at Shannon Airport have increased by more than 460,000 since 2012 when the airport became an independent entity.<\/p><p>In the same period Dublin Airport has increased passenger numbers by 12.4 million and Cork Airport by only 52,000.  Spreading just 20% of that growth across the regions would still leave Dublin Airport with 10 million additional passengers and the regions with an additional 2.5 million.  Such a move would have a far greater economic impact.  I wholeheartedly welcome the &euro;10 million route development fund and look forward to Shannon Airport capitalising on it for the benefit of the mid-west and west region in the interests of achieving balanced regional development.<\/p> <p> One aspect of the budget about which I have concerns is the just transition fund.  It is critically important that the economy of west Clare be kept under consideration in that regard.  Moneypoint is a coal burning power plant and needs a just transition to support it.  I have met the Minister on several occasions to discuss the issue.  It is critical that the Moneypoint plant be included in the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000034#GG00300","speaker":"1273","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570717200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Jack Chambers.<\/p>  <p>  Through the confidence and supply agreement, Fianna F&aacute;il secured an additional &euro;105 million for mental health services in the past three years.  In the budget announced last  year &euro;55 million was secured for mental health services.  In the budget announced this year &euro;39 million was announced, but it appears that &euro;26 million of this sum is to pay for pay increases and deal with other existing service level issues.  The remaining &euro;13 million is for services at the National Forensic Mental Health Service Hospital in Portrane.  While the money is welcome, in effect, this means that there is no funding available for new developments or other projects in 2020.  Considering the gaps in mental health services across the country, this will come as a serious disappointment to many.  It will potentially mean a year in which we will be at a standstill in mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  A Mental Health Commission report, published this morning, identified the long-term neglect of people with serious and enduring mental health illnesses in the mental health system.  This is just another in a regular series of reports on mental health services that have been highly critical of the gaps in services.  Issues identified in the report published this morning arise regularly in my constituency clinic in Wexford.  The department of psychiatry at Waterford University Hospital patches people up as best it can.  Once people with mental health issues are ready to leave the department of psychiatry, there is a problem in that there are no rehabilitation places or appropriate emergency accommodation available for them.  Very often they end up back on the streets or in inappropriate emergency accommodation, only to find themselves back in the department of psychiatry several months later.  We end up with a revolving door system.<\/p>  <p>  We are in year 13 of a ten-year mental health strategy known as A Vision for Change.  Barely over 50% of the staff recommended are in place.  For people with intellectual disabilities and a mental illness, there are less than 10% of the staff recommended in place.  In many regions there are no staff available to deal with people suffering from intellectual disabilities and a mental illness.  This means that other sectors of the mental health service have to pick up the slack, which creates pressure points and serious issues.  In its 2016 manifesto Fine Gael proposed expanding significantly the Jigsaw programme.  When I was elected in 2016, the talk was that a Jigsaw service would open in County Tipperary within a few months.  That still has not occurred.  No other Jigsaw services have opened in the entire time, which is simply unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We were promised a review and an update of the 2001 Mental Health Act.  When it was introduced, it was considered to be a model progressive Act.  However, it needs to be updated with a modern understanding of mental health.  Unqualified consultants are practising as consultant psychiatrists, something which has been condemned regularly by the President of the High Court.  That issue has not been addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of mental health facilities across the country remain unregulated and uninspected.  The Mental Health Commission has not been given the powers it needs.  This year we had the shocking situation where the mental health service at St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny was being prosecuted in the District Court for a lack of care for some of the most vulnerable patients in the hospital.  Suicide remains the greatest cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 24 years.  Primary care psychology waiting lists are shocking.  The number of anti-depressant prescriptions is on the increase because general practitioners see no other options or pathways to get people help in mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  In the replies to parliamentary questions several weeks ago we found out that &euro;24 million of the funding for mental health services had gone unspent so far this year.  This morning the Minister for Health said money would be spent as needed.  Money is desperately needed in mental health services.  The Minister claimed money was not an issue in solving mental health issues.  There is no lack of policy.  All that is left is implementation and oversight, both of which are significantly lacking across the entire Government portfolio, not just in mental health services.  We end up with a mental health service which patches people up, puts them out on the road, only to see them come back again some months later.  We need significant changes in mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a failure to develop a small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  Ireland is a small open economy which is vulnerable to what happens in the international economy.  In recent years we have had the economic winds behind our back, with record low interest rates on our debts.  The European Central Bank has introduced quantitative easing and there has been strong global demand for our products.  All of this has led to a significant bounce in the corporation tax yield, well ahead of anything predicted several years ago.  However, 45% of all corporation tax now comes from only ten companies.  This is unhealthy and dangerous as the money could disappear overnight.  It is similar to the situation with stamp duty 12 years ago.<\/p>  <p>  The economy needs to be rebalanced.  There is a need for greater emphasis on the small and medium-sized enterprise sector and indigenous firms.  We need to make Ireland an attractive place in which to innovate, as well as to start and grow small and medium-sized enterprises.  Many of the Government&rsquo;s supports for the sector are too complicated or unsuitable.  There is too much red tape for firms to negotiate.  While the improvement in the self-employed tax credit announced in the budget is to be welcomed, it has still not been equalised.  Insurance costs are crippling firms and have doubled for many businesses.  Some businesses must self-insure, while many festivals have been cancelled owing to the lack of insurance coverage.  The Government needs to take this issue seriously.  It must not just come up with plans but must implement them too.  Insurance awards in the courts are simply too high.  Fraudsters and exaggerators fear no consequences.  There continues to be a lack of transparency in the insurance industry.<\/p>  <p>  The south-east region has the highest rate of unemployment.  I have raised this matter continually with the Minister, but there seems to be no focus or sense of urgency to address it.  In Wexford we have few IDA Ireland jobs and little IDA Ireland land.  Those employed in the south east are on low incomes and the quality of jobs is poor.  We need to see higher quality jobs in the south east.  We must provide the necessary training to ensure people can take on those quality jobs when they are provided.<\/p>  <p>  There is a serious lack of targeting the south east.  Rosslare Europort receives two small mentions in the Ireland 2040 plan.  There is no mention of any project in the plan for the south east, save for two motorways which were already planned, paid for and practically built under the previous Government.  Rosslare Europort has not been brought up on a single occasion by any Minister when dealing with the United Kingdom on Brexit.  The United Kingdom technically still owns Rosslare Europort under a convoluted and age-old ownership model.  Having met the UK Transport Secretary at Westminster last summer, I understand the British Government is quite happy to separate Fishguard and Rosslare and hand Rosslare back to the Irish Government.  However, there is no interest in this happening.  Over &euro;100 million was invested in Dublin Port, from which ships were turned away fthis summer, yet Rosslare Europort is operating at 40% capacity.  It should be thriving.<\/p>  <p>  There has been little or no advancement in the development of a technological university for the south east.  What is happening?  When I was at Waterford Institute of Technology in the 1990s, we were told that it would be the university for the south east, but there seems to have been no advancement whatsoever.  Without a university in the south east, the economy of the region cannot be addressed because if one wants to attract international companies, they need to know that there is university training available for their employees as and when they will need it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address the issue of the disability training allowance of &euro;31.80 per week.  It was cut for new entrants this year.  It costs people with a disability more to undergo training to find work because it costs them more to live, particularly for transport.  I cannot understand the reason the cut was made as the allowance involved little cost.  It seems miserly and I was disappointed when it was not reversed in the budget.  The rehabilitative training allowance allowed people with disabilities an opportunity to move from education to employment.  It is most regrettable, therefore, that it has not been restored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101000035#HH00200","speaker":"1354"}]
