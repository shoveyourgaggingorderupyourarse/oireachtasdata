Trihalomethane is the issue before us today.  This matter is the result of an engagement with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, with which the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be very familiar, as we all are.  I want to put on the record our thanks to that organisation for the amazing work they do in their communities on the management of quality water.<\/p><p>I am very keen to hear from the Minister of State regarding the ongoing engagement between the European Commission and the Department on trihalomethanes and the issues around this.  I understand there continues to be ongoing correspondence between the Commission and the Department in respect of Ireland's failure to address trihalomethanes in several public and private water supplies.  I also understand that the Commission has indicated to Ireland its intention to escalate this case further, which may result in possible fines for the Government.  The National Federation of Group Water Schemes has urged every group water scheme impacted at this stage to engage with their local authorities and to seek best advice and best practice.<\/p><p>It is important that we have a balanced discussion.  The key message is that the use of chlorine to ensure safe drinking water is important and necessary.  Trihalomethanes are formed as a result of adding chlorine to water, although the chlorine is essential to ensure the quality of our drinking water.  Most drinking water in Ireland comes from surface water sources such as rivers, lakes and streams and it has to be treated because there is vegetative matter getting into the water streams.  As I said, most drinking water is treated with chlorine, which kills the bacteria and viruses commonly found in drinking water by disinfecting it.<\/p><p>I will use the term THM for trihalomethane.  I went on the HSE website today.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTHMs can be ingested (swallowed), if present in water.<br \/><br \/>THMs may be inhaled (breathed in), if present in air, as most THMs in water evaporate.<br \/><br \/>THMs can be inhaled or absorbed though the skin while showering or bathing.   <\/blockquote> <p>On the question &quot;How can THMs affect my health?&quot;, the HSE website states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSome studies suggest a link between long term exposure to THMs ... and cancer and reproductive effects but the evidence is not conclusive.<br \/><br \/>THMs are classified as &lsquo;possibly carcinogenic&rsquo; to humans...<br \/><br \/>There is some evidence that THMs cause cancer in animals.<br \/><br \/>Some studies suggest that very long-term exposure [to] THMs may be linked to ... increased risk of some types of cancer in humans, in particular bladder and colon cancer.  The evidence however, is not conclusive. <\/blockquote> <p>On the question &quot;What can I do to reduce my exposure to THMs?&quot; the website deals with that in great detail.<\/p><p>We have three organisations responsible for water, namely, Irish Water, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which has a serious role in monitoring the quality of water, and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.  I do not want to be alarmist but there is an issue in this regard.  At the kernel of this is the European Commission, which has raised concerns with the Government and the Department.  I would like to hear how that is going and what the Minister of State&rsquo;s knowledge is of these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#A00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising the important issue of trihalomethanes, THMs, in our public water supplies, which gives me an opportunity to give an overview of the work being undertaken to improve the quality and resilience of our public and private water supplies.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government sets out clear and ambitious commitments to ensure that Irish Water accelerates the resolution of schemes on the remedial action list of the Environmental Protection Authority, EPA, including that the formation of THMs is minimised.  We are also continuing to invest in a multi-annual capital funding programme to improve the quality of drinking water in community owned and run rural group water schemes.<\/p> <p>For public water supplies, the Senator will appreciate that since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  The maintenance and remedial work necessary in our water system is ongoing and being actively pursued.  It is likely that it will take a number of years and investment cycles to fully resolve all the issues and risks and address the pressures of an increasing population and a changing climate.  In response, the Government is providing substantial funding to Irish Water to fulfil its role and has committed to an ambitious, multi-annual funding plan.  The Government is delivering on the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p>Irish Water has completed large and complex projects such as a new water treatment plant at Vartry and a full upgrade of the Leixlip water treatment plant.  These two projects alone improved water quality and supply resilience for 717,000 people.  Irish Water is taking action to remove the risk of elevated levels of THMs forming in all public water supplies.  At the end of 2016, there were 71 supplies on the EPA's remedial action list for THMs, impacting 464,791 customers.  As of 30 September 2022, there were 24 supplies serving 243,137 people on the remedial action list for THMs.<\/p> <p>For private group water schemes, each local authority acts as the supervisory authority for its own functional area under the drinking water regulations and is supervised in this role by the EPA.  Each group water scheme is community owned and run.  The Department is working directly with local authorities to resolve remaining issues with private group water schemes that have THM issues or risks.  The adoption of effective measures to ensure compliance with the directive requires local authority liaison and co-operation with the management and members of these schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#B00100","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State's detailed and comprehensive reply, which confirms that the European Commission has been raising these issues since 2014 which is a long time ago.

At that time, the Commission had concerns regarding 73 public water supplies and 24 private group water schemes.  The Commission has publicly recognised that Ireland has made progress in addressing elevated levels of THMs in drinking water.  However, in November 2021, the Commission referred Ireland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failure to comply with the requirements of the drinking water directive.  In the referral, the Commission alleges that the level of THMs in drinking water has exceeded the parametric value established by the drinking water directive in 30 water supply zones, although this figure will be contested by Ireland during the case.

According to the most recent census, the population of Ballinspittle has grown by over 10%.  It is a unique little part of the world that has so much going for it but there has been an issue with schools in the area for at least a decade.  The majority of the schools in the locality, taking in Kinsale, Ballinspittle, Rennies, Minane Bridge, Belgooly and Dunderrow, have been upgraded but there are two schools in the district that have not been upgraded.  One is Summercove National School and the other is Ballinspittle National School.<\/p> <p>I seek clarity on the next phase for Ballinspittle National School.  A substantial project went to tender during the summer comprising a brand new second floor, a library, offices, a general purpose building, a special education room, an administration room and a store room.  The tender closed at the start of August and the question now relates to the next phase.  I want to get clarity on how this project will be progressed.  What is the timeline in terms of when we will see shovels in the ground?  This development will have a hugely positive impact on the community.  I accept that this is a complicated building project that will probably take place over two phases.  It may be necessary to knock half of the school and then build the other half.

The brief provides for the demolition of the existing buildings to provide accommodation for a new 12-classroom school, with three classrooms for pupils with special educational needs on the current site.<\/p> <p>This project entered architectural planning upon the appointment of the design team in July 2018.  Stage 1, preliminary design, was approved in July 2019, and the project then progressed to stage 2(a), developed design, where the design team developed the agreed design option and accurately cost planned the project so that it could be lodged for statutory approvals, including planning permission.<\/p> <p>Stage 2(a), developed design, was approved by the Department in August 2021, and the board of management and its design team were subsequently authorised to commence stage 2(b), detailed design.

Mr. Petr Kyn&scaron;tetr.  On behalf of all my colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I extend a warm welcome to you and wish you a very successful visit to Ireland.<\/p> <p>On the occasion of the Czech national day, which is on Friday, I would like to share some remarks on behalf of the Cathaoirleach.  An independent Czechoslovakia was declared on Wenceslas Square in Prague on 28 October 1918, just a year before the first sitting of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, our first independent Parliament, in 1919.  Following independence, Ireland and Czechoslovakia developed contacts at various levels, particularly at the League of Nations.<\/p> <p>Similar to Ireland, the Czech Republic has gone through periods in its history of being without independence.  Today, the Czech Republic is our partner within the European Union, where we hold shared values.  It is particularly important to remember our European bond this year as the Czech Republic holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.<\/p> <p>Closer relations followed the Velvet Revolution in 1989 and, in 1995, the Irish Embassy was established in Prague.  President V&aacute;clav Havel visited Ireland in 1996, during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency.  Former President Mary Robinson said she agreed with EU enlargement and understood how important EU membership was for the Czech Republic, which joined the EU in 2004.  Ireland and the Czech Republic continue to share common values and commitments, including membership of the EU - as I alluded to earlier - and of the United Nations.<\/p> <p>In the front entrance of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a bronze bust of renowned playwright V&aacute;clav Havel, the first President of the Czech Republic, was unveiled in mid-June 2015.  This was a significant and symbolic moment for Czech-Irish relations.  After the United States of America, Ireland became only the second country in the world where a national legislative assembly decided to permanently honour the legacy of former President Havel.  The two countries have been mutually enriching each other in many areas.<\/p> <p>The relationship is a long-standing one, as Irish Franciscans - colloquially called Hibernians - found refuge in Prague in 17th century.  After the Second World War, Czech glass manufacturer Charles Karel Bacik, found refuge in Ireland and later co-founded Waterford Glass.  His granddaughter, Deputy Ivana Bacik, is a renowned Irish politician and academic.  She is a distinguished former Member of this House and is now a Member of the Lower House - the other part of the bicameral Parliament - as well as leader of the Irish Labour Party.<\/p> <p>On this occasion, I wish the ambassador, H.E. Mr. Petr Kyn&scaron;tetr, and the over 8,000 Czechs living in Ireland a happy independence day.  I again welcome the delegation to Ireland.  It is wonderful to have them here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#C00500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Nithe i dtosach su\u00edonna (At\u00f3g\u00e1il) - Commencement Matters (Resumed)","time":1666776600,"counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#C00650"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Control of Dogs","time":1666776600,"counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#C00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State but I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is not here to take this Commencement matter, particularly given that her constituency contains many dog breeding establishments.

Even if they were followed to the letter, which they are not, it would be perfectly reasonable in the eyes of this Government that a DBE keep hundreds of breeding bitches and have one staff member looking after 25 breeding bitches and all of their pups.<\/p><p>The use of automation, the industrial nature of puppy farms and the lack of human interaction are resulting in poorly-socialised dogs with a range of behavioural issues.  The fallout from this is becoming very clear in recent months as pounds are dealing with the Covid-regret puppies.  During the lockdowns, many people rushed into buying a puppy for the family without fully understanding the commitment that a dog is.  Puppy farms subsequently ramped up supply and churned out puppies to meet the insatiable demand.  They gave no thought to the misery they were inflicting on the breeding mothers or the welfare of the resulting pups.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the chickens are now coming home to roost.  Some people are returning to work unable to look after the poor dogs, and others are dealing with young dogs that are manifesting a wide range of behavioural issues, many of which are due to the fact that they were born on these puppy farms.  PetBond vet, Dr. Tim Kirby, has rightly called such farms a chain of misery and said that mothers are stressed, overbred and pass on their fear and anxiety to their young.<\/p><p>Dogs Trust has seen a considerable increase in the number of dogs being surrendered and an overwhelming list from local authority pounds seeking shelter space with it.  In addition to the Covid-regret pups, those dealing in the sale of dogs are now faced with pups they cannot sell and an oversupply of breeding bitches.  Dogs Trust has had 54 pups in the past three weeks alone, 15 of which were crossbreeds taken in from the local pound with no mother to be found.  <\/p><p>To compound matters, the housing and cost-of-living crisis is impacting on the number of dogs being surrendered and abandoned.  Families with notices to quit or whose landlords will not allow pets are now having to surrender their much-loved pets, which is devastating and denies children the joy and life skills that pet ownership brings, which includes empathy.<\/p><p>When I visited the new Dublin county pound, I was told that up to 30% of surrenders are now down to housing issues and an increasing number of dogs are being abandoned or surrendered because they are old and have health issues.  Poor Lenny, a Shih Tzu, was left in a crate under a bridge recently.  Sam, an old cairn terrier, was found wandering along a busy road blind and covered in mange.  Maggie, the lurcher from Carlow-Kilkenny pound, was dehydrated and had acid burns, an untreated broken toe and a large growth on her hind leg.  There is no excuse for any of this and those responsible should be held accountable.  However, all of the shelters and pounds are saying the exact same thing: the phone will not stop ringing.  There is a tsunami of unwanted dogs.<\/p><p>What work is happening in the Department of Rural and Community Development to ensure that the local authority dog pounds are equipped for this situation?  What does the Minister plan to do in the long term to end the scourge of puppy farms and industrial dog breeding?

These responsibilities include the dog-licensing and dog-warden service and the management and operation of the local authority pounds or shelters.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has no involvement in these operational activities.<\/p><p>With regard to the provision of pounds and shelters, section 15(2) of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 empowers local authorities to enter into arrangements with any person for the provision and maintenance of dog pounds or shelters.  The Act also provides for such persons or organisations to carry out the functions of the local authority under the Act with regard to the acceptance, detention, disposal and destruction of stray or unwanted dogs.<\/p><p>Section 15(3) of the 1986 Act empowers local authorities to enter into arrangements with any other local authority, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, or a person connected with animal welfare, for the exercise of all or any of its functions, other than its functions under sections 17 or 30 of the Act.  The procurement of any service related to local authority pounds is therefore a matter for each local authority and the management and operation of such pounds or shelters are matters solely for the relevant local authority.  Similarly, the enforcement of welfare standards for all animals, including the welfare of dogs in pounds or shelters, is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and one in which the Minister's Department has no direct role.<\/p><p>The Department of Rural and Community Development publishes annual statistics on local authority dog-related activities including statistics on local authority pounds and stray and unwanted dogs and makes them available at <i>gov.ie<\/i>.  The 2021 dog-control statistics, made up of returns from all local authorities, indicate that there are 34 local authority dog shelters or pounds.  I am pleased to note that the number of stray, seized and unwanted dogs entering local authority pounds is decreasing year on year.  The figures are down from more than 26,000 in 2002 to 4,270 in 2021.  This figure was 5,310 in 2020; 9,162 in 2019; 9,961 in 2018; and 11,774 in 2017.<\/p><p>Similarly, the total number of dogs euthanised in local authority pounds has reduced dramatically in recent years.  In 2021, 168 dogs were euthanised in local authority pounds which was down from 172 in 2020 and 1,674 in 2016.  This continues the year-on-year annual trend in the decline in the number of dogs euthanised which is down from just over 215,000 in 2002.<\/p><p>These figures show the tremendous work being done by the local authority dog warden and pound service in the re-homing of dogs and their active engagement with dog welfare groups and charities.  Some 1,077 dogs were re-homed directly by local authority pounds and 1,934 were transferred to dog welfare groups for re-homing in 2021.  In 2020, 1,341 dogs were re-homed directly and 2,545 were transferred to dog welfare groups.<\/p><p>These statistics also demonstrate the success of the neutering and microchipping programmes operated by animal welfare charities.  These programmes operated by some animal welfare charities, with some limited support from the Minister's Department, have successfully reduced the number of unwanted litters of puppies.  Ongoing microchipping has also facilitated the reunification of 1,064 dogs with their owners in 2021 and of 1,286 in 2020 and 1,924 in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#D00200","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has just summed up the problem in his response in that it is scattered all over multiple Departments.

I thank the Cathaoirleach's office for choosing this Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State will know, the school meals programme provides funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged schoolchildren.  The programme is approved and funded by the Department of Social Protection, and funding is based on a rate of payment per meal per child, per day.<\/p> <p>I recently met with Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, GRETB, which very much values this scheme and does tremendous work for schools across its region, in both city and county areas as well as in Connemara.  GRETB is concerned about a number of issues.<\/p> <p>First, there has been no review of Department of Social Protection maximum rates of payment in over a decade.  The Department of Social Protection is aware of the extra costs currently facing suppliers.  GRETB understands that an independent evaluation of the school meals programme has taken place and that its preliminary findings will inform future policy decisions.  The Department, however, has provided no update.  Suppliers are no longer applying for school meals tenders, and current suppliers are withdrawing from the scheme to mitigate their losses.  This is a serious situation in that nobody is applying for tenders to provide the school meals for which the Department and the Government are paying.  That is one of the main issues GRETB is experiencing in respect of school meals.<\/p> <p>Merlin College was awarded DEIS status on 7 July of this year for school meals for 700 students.  GRETB ran an accelerated school meals procurement procedure during August, which received no tender response.  GRETB is at this time unable to recruit a supplier for Merlin College that is prepared to provide cold lunches at the price stipulated.  Therefore, students do not have access to school catering services.  Col&aacute;iste Cholmcille, Indreabh&aacute;n, and Col&aacute;iste na bPiarsach, Ros Muc, both DEIS schools, have been advised by their tender-holder that he is no longer able to provide school meals at the current price and that his losses are accumulating.  Elphin Community College, County Roscommon, which provides school breakfasts, has been advised by its tender-supplier that it is running at a loss and has been for the past year.  GRETB is aware of other ETBs experiencing issues with the appointment of tenderers for the school meals programme.<\/p> <p>As for the basic payment rates for breakfasts or snacks, the maximum rate of pay per child per day is 60 cent.  That requires the provision of two items.  An example is one serving of wholemeal or wholegrain cereal of bread plus one serving of fruit or one serving of milk, yoghurt or cheese.  For a lunch the maximum rate of payment is &euro;1.40 for one substantial item and one small item plus a drink.  That also includes a wholemeal or wholegrain sandwich or roll containing one serving of meat, poultry, egg or cheese, one serving of salad and one serving of fruit plus a drink - for example, water, milk or unsweetened juice.  For dinner the maximum rate of payment is &euro;1.90 per child per day.  That is for a hot meal and a drink.  That includes one serving of meat, poultry, egg or beans plus one serving of potatoes, pasta or rice, plus two servings of vegetables and fruit plus a drink - again, milk, water or unsweetened juice.  For a hot meal the rate is &euro;2.90.  That is per the nutritional standards document as well.<\/p> <p>This is a very important and much-valued scheme but it is under huge pressure.  I might use the word \"crisis\" at this stage because, as I said, when tenderers do not even apply to provide the scheme and when tenderers that are providing it are doing so at a loss in the hope that there will be a review and additional rates or that the situation will improve, that is a serious situation for the communities involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#E00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kyne for raising this very important matter of the rates paid to providers of school meals across the country under the school meals programme.  The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,700 schools and organisations, benefiting 260,000 children.  The objective of the programme is to provide regular nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good-quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.<\/p> <p>A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme this year, with an additional &euro;9 million provided to allow access to all newly designated DEIS schools from September 2022.  Funding under the school meals programme can be provided for breakfast, snacks, cold lunches, dinner, hot school meals and after-school clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal provided.<\/p> <p>As part of budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019 providing hot school meals in primary schools.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefiting 6,744 students for the 2019-20 academic year and was aimed at primary schools with no on-site cooking facilities.  An independent review of the hot school meals pilot which was completed in July 2020 found that all stakeholders indicated that the pilot project had a positive impact on children's diet, behaviour, attentiveness and psychological well-being.<\/p> <p>In budget 2021 the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced that an additional &euro;5.5 million would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children currently receiving the cold lunch option.<\/p> <p>Budget 2022 provided for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000 children as referred to.

I thank him for being here, because it is in his Department.  I would like to acknowledge the good work he is doing as Minister of State in the Department of Health.<\/p><p>I tabled this Commencement matter on foot of the retirement of Dr. Victor O&rsquo;Loughlin from his post as a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist for children with disabilities.  There has been no replacement found for this role.  We now have children in the south east of Ireland waiting indefinitely for psychiatric assessment because we do not have any psychiatrist.  Under the Disability Act, a child is entitled to have an assessment of needs completed within six months, including a service statement that lists the services the HSE proposes to provide to meet a child&rsquo;s needs.  However, this is not happening.<\/p><p>I would like to mention two examples of families and parents who are at their wits' end because of the lack of services within the HSE.  The first one is Mark Darmody, who is from my parish of Ardfinnan-Grange.  He stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tOur son Neil ... is severely autistic and was diagnosed with autism in 2016.  He was reassessed in 2018, but his development has been almost non-existent.  The severity of his presentation is now obvious as he is 100% non-verbal, has almost no comprehension, is not toilet-trained and is sporadically violent towards himself and others.  We had been urging the HSE to intervene from early 2019 onwards as it was clear to us that Neil's diagnosis with a mild intellectual disability was not accurate for his presentation.<br \/><br \/>In February 2020, as a result of a referral ... Neil was examined by Dr. Victor O'Loughlin... on behalf of the HSE.  He emphatically stated by letter ... that Neil was in the severe range of intellectual incapacity and that he required reassessment &quot;as a priority&quot; before [psychiatric services] could be considered.  This urgent letter was sent to three HSE managers.<br \/><br \/>On the 29th June 2022, as a result of substantial pressure from us as parents, we received a letter of apology from ... [the] disability manager in Clonmel.  She stated that the letter of Dr. O'Loughlin was never actioned [on] and she speculated that she could only conclude that Covid must have been the reason.  What is certain is that our son was never considered for assessment ... during that time period. <br \/><br \/>This situation is now [exacerbated] by a telephone call I [received from] the HSE services manager in Clonmel... who informed me that Neil would now sit on a waiting list &quot;indefinitely.&quot;  Despite my requests for an approximate indication of when he [would] be seen, she continued with her &quot;indefinitely&quot; statement.  She also informed me that there is no psychiatrist presently recruited by the HSE in the south east of Ireland.  <\/blockquote> <p>His wife, Noelle, is now attempting to source private therapies that could cost up to &euro;9,000 for the entirety of the type of service that Neil requires.<\/p><p>There is another lady in Clonmel and I do not have permission to use her name, so I will not.  She is at her wits' end as well.  Her boy needs to be assessed in order to be on the correct medication to ease his constant frustrations.  He constantly stims, so he is always shouting, hitting and breaking things in sheer frustration.  He even does it in his sleep.  His parents are reducing their working hours to ensure that someone is always there.  I will read out part of what she said to outline the frustration that she feels.  She stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tOur home is now and has been at complete crisis point for a long time which ye are [well] aware of since our last emergency professionals meeting a number of months ago.  I would like to point out that our ability to cope is beyond that of the norm, however the current situation outweighs any degree of coping.  Simply put &ldquo;the demands are too high and the professional expertise is non-existent which is contributing to the bleakness of the present and future of our beautiful boy and family&rdquo;.  We have no support, we are at a point of total burnout and it has fallen on deaf ears.  There are currently so many acute and enduring issues in our home that we do not know where to turn. <\/blockquote> <p>Those are families who are struggling immensely because of the lack of services in the south-east region.

On 9 September, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, launched the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, intellectual disability model of service.  This marked a significant achievement for mental health services in line with the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to improve all aspects of mental health services and ensure they remain person-centred and accessible to all.  As the Senator knows, the CAMHS intellectual disability model of service was developed to enhance supports for children and adolescents with intellectual disability by advancing specialist mental health services nationally and standardising the care provided to children, adolescents and their families.<\/p> <p>Prior to the development of this model of service, there was no nationally agreed framework that would enable existing and future CAMHS intellectual disability teams to deliver services in a consistent and co-ordinated manner across the country.  This model addresses that vacuum by providing national guidance on how to deliver integrated person-centred services consistently nationwide.  It will increase the confidence and ability of service providers, both the HSE and independent agencies, to deliver successful and safe mental health intellectual disability services to a high-quality standard.  It proposes effective partnerships between healthcare providers, children and adolescents with lived experience, their families and local communities.<\/p> <p>The CAMHS intellectual disability model of service was informed by the broader policy context in which it was developed and Sharing the Vision, Sl&aacute;intecare and the findings of the Maskey report were also significantly considered throughout.  The process of developing teams in Ireland in line with Sharing the Vision recommendations has begun, with the development of several teams across the country.  The Sharing the Vision implementation plan 2022-24, which was launched earlier this year, will ensure we are closely monitoring the development of further child and adult teams.  The launch of the model of service coincides with the reconfiguration of disability services into the children disability network teams, which adopt the health and social care approach to the provision of relevant disability supports to children.  The model of service provides clear guidance to ensure these network teams work closely and collaboratively with CAMHS intellectual disability teams to the benefit of those accessing the services.<\/p> <p>North Tipperary lies within Mid West Community Healthcare in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 3 and south Tipperary lies within South East Community Healthcare in CHO 5.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A full-time mental health intellectual disability child consultant has been recruited in the mid-west area.

A professional from the UK currently comes over once a month.  In this regard, the HSE is not fit for purpose.  Certainly from the perspective of parents of children with disabilities, it is just not accountable.<\/p> <p>Staffing and recruitment are issues.  The HSE should be using the work permits scheme more to find people outside of the jurisdiction to work in the sector.  It does not seem to be using it as much as it should.  Mark and Noelle Darmody have looked at prices to get a private assessment and it is approximately &euro;9,000.  Parents who go private should be able to claim back the cost.  It is not their fault they have to go private.  It is because of the lack of services we provide that they, for the good of the child, scrape to try to find money to make sure the child gets assessed as quickly as possible.

Ireland and the Irish have had an enormous influence throughout history, not only on Austria but on western and central Europe as a whole.  Austria gave refuge to generations of the Wild Geese and their descendants, with names like O'Donnell, Lacy, Browne, Kavanagh and Laudon having entered the annals of Austrian military history.  Maximilian O'Donnell saved the life of Emperor Franz Joseph during an assassination attempt in 1853 and received the title of Count from the Emperor.  The events of that fateful day still mark the Viennese skyline, with the landmark Votivkirche constructed in celebration and thanks for the Emperor's rescue.<\/p> <p>It is a source of great pride that a Centre for Irish Studies at the University of Vienna continues to be a place of outstanding scholarship, providing a home for high-level research by Irish and Austrian scholars alike.  In the military academy in Wiener Neustadt are 30 portraits of Austria's most distinguished commanders, at least 12 of whom are Irish or have Irish origins.  One was from a famous aristocratic family here.<\/p> <p>The relationship between Ireland and Austria has deep historical roots dating back to the Irishman Fergal or Virgilius, the Bishop of Salzburg in the eighth century.  The Irish monk Colm&aacute;n was martyred at Stockerau near Vienna in 1012 and for centuries was venerated as Austria's national saint.  Irish Benedictines were instrumental in making Vienna the capital of Austria.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day has been celebrated in the Austrian capital since the 12th century.  The dark days of the Second World War brought Austria&rsquo;s most famous export to Ireland.  Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger, the famous Austrian physicist and Nobel Prize winner, migrated to Dublin in 1940.  He was invited by &Eacute;amon de Valera personally and established the Institute of Advanced Studies in Dublin.<\/p> <p>Ambassador Thomas Nader is in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery today and I had the pleasure of speaking to him earlier.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the ambassador is on his second mission to Ireland.  He sought that mission because he has a tremendous love of our country and has developed a network of friends here.  He was thwarted somewhat by Covid-19 but is now embarking on what we hope will be a particularly fruitful second term.  We all look forward to interacting with him.  I have the great privilege of being a member of his friendship society, along with a number of other Senators who are present today.  We look forward to strengthening those relationships.  I wish Ambassador Nader and all Austrians, including those living in Ireland, a very happy national day.  It is wonderful to have the ambassador with us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#K00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1666776600,"counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#K00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I also welcome Ambassador Nader on his return visit to Ireland.

I will start off with a very positive story.  A young woman from Westport, Shannon Sweeney, won a bronze medal at the European Elite Boxing Championships last week.  A homecoming event was held in Mayo on Sunday.  I congratulate her and her very proud coach, Mr. Martin Brennan.  I know that a lot of work over many years, not just by Shannon but by the team around her and the boxing club in Westport, went into getting her into a position where she had an opportunity to win a medal.  Her fantastic performance in the event meant that she won the bronze medal.  We have had some fantastic successes in female boxing in recent weeks and it is great to see the sport doing so well.  Katie Taylor paved the way but so many young women are now following in her footsteps.  It is great to see.  I wish Shannon Sweeney and her family well.<\/p> <p>The recent announcement by the Minister for Justice of proposals to change the licensing laws is broadly welcome, although a significant amount of concern is being expressed across the board, including by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, has acknowledged that reform is needed but it is concerned about how it will be managed in the context of resources and Garda numbers, given the potential for an increase in antisocial behaviour.  I understand the Minister and the Government will be providing additional supports for communities to help them to adjust to the new licensing laws.  Our licensing laws were out of date and did need updating.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In tandem with that, we have a significant issue with antisocial behaviour across the country.  It is not just a Dublin issue.  It happens everywhere.  One can look at other cities in the world.  I was recently in Krak&oacute;w in Poland and in other European cities during the summer.  There is a visible police presence on the streets that we just do not see here.  I am not sure what the difference is.  I was in Spain with my family during the summer and I do not think ten minutes passed without us seeing a member of the police force making people feel safe, because there were many tourists coming in who did not know the area.  For some reason, our capital city seems to be different.  It is the same for Galway, Limerick, Cork and even smaller towns, like my own town, Castlebar.  One just does not see as much of a Garda presence as people would like to see.  There is a consistent call from the public to have more garda&iacute; doing community policing, being on the beat and knowing their area.  A debate is needed on that.  I know other colleagues requested that yesterday.  I understand that the Leader's office has requested that from the Minister.<\/p><p>I welcome the change to licensing laws.  It is good for business and it is good to have flexibility, because it does not help to have everybody come out onto the streets at the same time.  Equally, we need to reassure the public that resources are there to protect people and that antisocial behaviour will be dealt with appropriately.<\/p><p>I know I am almost out of time.  Wind Energy Ireland made a presentation in the audiovisual room this morning.  There seem to be fantastic opportunities for renewable energy off the coast, particularly the west coast, where it is the windiest, but we seem to be moving at a snail's pace.  We were world leaders in renewables and wind energy ten years ago but now we are at the back of the class.  It would be great to have a debate in the House at the earliest opportunity about renewables, with a focus on wind energy and offshore wind energy potential.  My understanding from the Department's reply is that the technology is not available to install wind energy north of Mayo.  Experts who I have spoken to tell me that the technology is available and is currently floating off the coast of Aberdeen in Scotland.  It has it but, for some reason, we do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#K00500","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>It is hard to stop Senator Chambers in full flow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#L00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach who has been awarded the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise.

It is unbelievable that that Department has such reach into every single Department.  Why do we have Ministers at all?  Let us get rid of them all and let the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform run the entire country.  I have spoken about the power of the Civil Service.  It is becoming annoying.  Someone who wants to hire a secretary now has to ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and wait for its blessing.  This needs to stop.<\/p><p>I opened the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>today and saw an article about my favourite organisation in Ireland, the Irish Coast Guard, once again.  It is about to spend &euro;400,000 plus VAT on pens, pencils, bags, hats, t-shirts and so on related to branding.  Will somebody please tell me what cost-benefit analysis went into this madness?  We are talking about water safety.  A sum of &euro;400,000 would cover a significant education programme for all water users, not just those lucky enough to turn up and get a free hat.  Will the free hat do much to save lives?  I do not believe it will.  This organisation is totally out of control.  I already mentioned that we are going to pay over &euro;1 billion for our search and rescue helicopters.  While the UK gets 12 bases with 18 helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and drones for &pound;1.6 billion sterling, we get five helicopters and top cover for over &euro;1 billion.  I believe the cost will be between &euro;1.3 billion and &euro;1.5 billion by the time this is signed off.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is stopping a few sergeants who are valuable to the Defence Forces from being retained.  What is the Department doing about the money being spent by the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard?  The Irish Coast Guard did away with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, life jackets and brought in its own, which were found to be dangerous in 2015 and taken out of service in 2018.  Something is wrong with the governance of that organisation.  I have spoken on it until I have been blue in the face and I am getting tired of there being no corporate oversight.  I mentioned this yesterday.  Daniel O'Connell's article at the weekend referred to the lack of oversight and control that politics has over the Civil Service.  It is out of control.

This is the second time the project has been removed.  The Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport report was launched during the week.  The northern distributor road has miraculously disappeared from the agenda again.  It was previously removed but, following fierce opposition from local councillors and Deputies, the project was put back into the report, but in the final report from the National Transport Authority, it has disappeared.  It beggars belief.  Where has the road disappeared to?  It is necessary for the economic development of the area and for opening up the Moyross area.  I acknowledge that a railway line and new rail station were announced for Moyross last week.  While that is welcome, we still need the road.  We need it to finish the bypass of Limerick city and to stop unnecessary traffic from coming into the centre of the city.  The University of Limerick is looking at a significant expansion and many businesses are looking at opening in that area.  If this road project is not put back into the report, we will go nowhere.  It is a serious issue.  I would like the Leader's support on this.  I will speak to the Minister for Transport today.  It only came to light in the last 24 hours that this road is missing from the report.  I ask the Leader for her support on that.<\/p> <p>Limerick Going for Gold was held last night.

I know that many will welcome the jobs that it will create locally but, for me, it is a reminder of why we urgently need legislation to ban the deliberate dumping of new non-food products.<\/p><p>In 2018, an investigation in Germany found that Amazon was destroying thousands of new and unused items in its warehouses and, despite the public outcry at the time and Amazon claiming it would do its best to resell and-or donate unsold items, the practice continued.  A subsequent undercover investigation in France and Britain revealed that hundreds of thousands of products are going straight to the dump.  A leaked spreadsheet from the British fulfilment centre showed products, including laptops, smart TVs, hairdryers, headphones, drones and books, all marked for destruction.  When goods go to landfill without ever being used, they do not just waste the product and all of the energy and raw materials that went into making them, but we are also facilitating the greedy overconsumption and unsustainable business model of large corporations.<\/p><p>It is disappointing that while the Government was introducing the circular economy legislation, it had a chance to clamp down on this morally bankrupt carry-on but, unfortunately, it chose not to and rejected the amendments we brought forward.  Instead, all we heard was the championing of the levy on plastic coffee cups.  That is why I have decided I need to bring forward the legislation that would introduce the ban on the deliberate destruction or dumping of new non-food items that would include those electronic products but also textiles, school equipment, leisure products and furniture.  It is too long now that the negative environmental costs have been borne by society.  It is time businesses were forced to bear the full costs of their business practices.  I hope the Government will adopt this common-sense legislation so it can move swiftly through the Stages and become law.<\/p><p>A final point concerns Commencement matters.  There were issues around the responses given to some Members last week.  Today, I would like to express my disappointment that my Commencement matter was not taken by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, or even by a Minister from within that Department.

First, I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Harris, to review postgraduate supports.  This is incredibly important and something I have been campaigning on for a very long time.  Only in the past few weeks, I met with the postgraduate workers union, which is doing very important work on representation for postgraduate students as workers.  A conversation we need to start having concerns where postgraduate students fall because they are falling into a halfway house between being students yet they are also working, and they are getting neither the benefits nor representation in either of those areas.  I support the calls of the postgraduate workers union and believe it has some very interesting and radical ideas about how we can address postgraduates and their framing within the system.<\/p> <p>I will not labour the point too much.  For context, in the past ten years, postgraduate supports have increased by approximately 3% from some &euro;18,000 to &euro;18,500 yet rents have gone up by 70%.  It is not a sustainable model.  We pride ourselves on being a land of saints and scholars but unless someone is one of the lucky few who can access scholarship funding or supports, it is not an option to undertake further study.  As I said, I welcome the Minister's commitment to reviewing this and I look forward to working with him on it, but if we are being realistic about it, there has been a 3% increase for postgraduate supports in the last ten years and a 70% increase in rents.  That is the state of play with regard to postgraduate supports.<\/p> <p>The other issue concerns the planning applications to be lodged for two transport projects in Dublin 11 and Dublin 9, one being the railway order for the ever-promised metro project and the other the Ballymun-Finglas to city centre core bus corridor.  It is important to note that these current planning consultations are not like the previous non-statutory ones.  They are the actual statutory planning processes and the final decision will impact the final constructed design.  I know people who have said &ldquo;Sure we are back at it again and we are being asked for our thoughts yet again on this bus corridor&rdquo;.  I emphasise that this consultation is the one that is going to impact on the final design.  It is all around walking, cycling, the provision of enhanced bus measures and so on.  I highlight that the deadline for submissions is 15 November 2022, which is coming up soon, and that this is the actual statutory consultation which will have an impact on the final layout and what the final construction design will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#M00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Civil Engagement Group, I call Senator Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#M00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I want to formally object to the content of the Order of Business for tomorrow, Thursday, which is done in the form of a motion.  Again, it is regrettable that we are seeing Bills being taken at all Stages.  This Government has developed too much of an attachment to emergency legislation.  I am also conscious in the case of both of these Bills, and I was on the relevant committee for one of them, that the Government asked for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny and then is also truncating proper scrutiny in the Chamber.  I am very concerned that we are getting a lot of legislation, including in areas which have been well flagged, such as the manner in which we should be dealing with rental protection and protection against evictions, but we are dealing with it in an emergency way and that legislation is not getting proper scrutiny.  I know that is not the Leader&rsquo;s decision but I have to convey formally that this is not good practice.<\/p> <p>Similarly, I would agree it is not good practice to have Ministers from unrelated Departments dealing with Commencement matters.  Commencement matters must be a matter of engagement.  Ministers need to be able to come back and forth and answer, and that is why there is a two-stage process in that regard.  If Ministers coming in are not even from the relevant Department, that is a problem.  Specifically, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, perhaps needs to come to this House on a couple of topics, one of which, I would suggest, is the gender-proofing of our pensions system.  That is one where it would be very useful to have a debate.<\/p> <p>The main issue I want to highlight is one that is fundamental to Ireland's reputation and our credibility internationally.  Yesterday, in the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, we heard from representatives of Friends of the Earth, who spoke about the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and called for us to take a lead in moving away from fossil fuels internationally.  This is complementary to what Senator Chambers has said.  In that regard, they highlighted that one of the reasons Ireland would have credibility to lead if it chose to do so was that &ndash; this is a near-quote - for decades Ireland, thanks to the dedication of successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, has led the way on disarmament and non-proliferation issues at UN level.  They highlighted that at the time when the message from everywhere was that everyone needed nuclear weapons or else they were not safe, and that was the responsible thing to do, Ireland was one of the countries that led and said \"No\" because an arms race makes us less safe.  Similarly, we are sometimes being told that fossil fuels are part of what will make us secure in the short term but they are actually exacerbating our vulnerabilities.<\/p> <p>Sadly, however, the reason I have to raise this matter is that I am concerned that the credibility built up by successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs over many years is being undermined over the last short period of time.  I say that in the context of Ireland having led and been the first country, under Frank Aiken, to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and having been the country that hosted the successful ban on cluster munitions.  I was in Croke Park when we negotiated that.  However, Ireland is now in a situation where we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs just over a week ago speaking at an arms fair in the Aviva Stadium, which, if we want to insult the environment further, was called \"Building the ecosystem &ndash; identifying connections for collaboration in Security, Defence and Dual Technologies\".

I would like to hear from the Minister on the growing problems with issues of governance and control that have begun to limit the creative freedom and the level of community involvement in some of these events.  In recent years we have seen a serious and very necessary tightening up in governance procedures in every walk of life.  We know the reasons for that.  However, there is increasing evidence that overemphasis on governance issues is leading to a paralysis in creative thinking on many boards, particularly those in which the arts are concerned.  The effect is that local endeavour is being chilled and local involvement diminished.  Listowel Writers' Week, with which I am familiar, is an internationally renowned festival.  Its model has been adopted as a template for similar festivals throughout the country.  It is now in its 52nd year.  It was the intention of its founders who included our local internationally renowned authors, Dr. Bryan MacMahon and Dr. John B. Keane, that the festival would be devised, organised and managed by the community of Listowel.  There was to be no &eacute;ir&iacute; in airde, no intellectual snobbery and no exclusivity about Listowel Writers' Week.  That is why it has succeeded.  This has been the secret of its success for more than half a century.  Recently, however, this community-based model has come under threat with a proposal that an excellent representative committee be abolished and that Listowel Writers' Week henceforth be run by a very small, exclusive board of directors with the help of a paid curator.  I need not state the reaction to this proposal in Listowel and in the wider world of literature.  It has been one of shock and horror.  I do not believe the Minister would wish to see community involvement replaced by small, exclusive boards that would have no answerability and no rapport with people on the ground.  The arts will never flourish in the culture of the closed shop.  I look forward to the Minister coming in to discuss these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#N00700","speaker":"1694"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I would like to ask for a debate on Irish Water at some stage, hopefully between now and Christmas.  I ask for this because of the quality of water in my town of Dundalk, a town of 42,000 people, over the past 18 months.  Undoubtedly, Irish Water is very good at communicating with Oireachtas Members and councillors.  We all get emails and updates every day.  I cannot fault its level of communication, but what I can fault and want to call into question is the type of responses.  For the past 18 months in County Louth, we have been getting the exact same responses about why the water quality is so poor in Dundalk.  We are told that there is sediment in the pipes and when issues happen, the sediment rises up.  To put into context what that means, when you turn on a tap now in Dundalk, brown water runs straight out for the first minute.  The advice from Irish Water is to let the tap go for a minute and after that you can drink it.  That is not an acceptable solution.  It has been happening sporadically for 18 months.  I am not rising in the Seanad today just because it has happened in the past two days.  This has been happening consistently now for 18 months.  It is not acceptable for Irish Water to have the same excuse for 18 months.  It leads me to believe there is something else happening.  Is there another reason for this?  Is there something that Irish Water is not telling us?  It cannot be the same excuse consistently every time.  It is simply not acceptable in a town of 42,000 people that they do not have quality drinking water, that they are being forced to buy bottled water, and that they are afraid to use the water that comes out of their taps.  I am convinced it is not only an issue in my town.  I am sure it happens throughout the country.  I would appreciate it if the Leader could organise a debate on Irish Water at some stage between now and Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#N00800","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>We would all want to wish Rishi Sunak the very best as he takes the helm in Britain.  Let us hope that his term as Prime Minister will be one where there is a restoration in the quality of British-Irish relations.  Let us hope that we are now entering a period of stability and greater rapprochement and understanding.  Hopefully there can be important dialogue about issues such as the Troubles amnesty legislation and the Northern Ireland protocol in order that, at a time when the world faces so many challenges on different fronts, we can at least get our British-Irish relations right and start solving some of the problems and getting them out of the way.  I think everybody would wish him a fair wind.<\/p> <p>On the subject of wind, I attended a Wind Energy Ireland briefing this morning with other colleagues.  We heard about the exciting plans to develop wind energy.  I understand that more than 28 GW is being planned in the longer term.  The aim is to get to 10 GW by 2030.  We were informed that wind energy currently supplies around one third of the Irish electricity requirement, as we all know.  However, there are many problems, including issues such as whether the community is going to benefit directly.  There is a difference between money being given to the GAA locally and various kinds of community benefit funds and the kind of significant community stake in the benefits to be enjoyed for which there is a real desire among the public.  Just because we secure the supply of energy through wind energy into the future does not necessarily mean that the price of energy will be kept down sufficiently.  That was one of the many issues.<\/p> <p>We need to see a greater pragmatism from the Government about solving problems like modular housing, or striking the right balance between consultation with the community and getting things done.  I will mention Derrybrien briefly in this context.  Just because something was done wrong in the past does not obviate the need for a pragmatic solution at a time of energy crisis.  We need to get those windmills turning.  It cannot be beyond the wit of this Government to come up with a way to get that done.  I hope the Seanad Independent Group will offer a solution to that in the form of Senator McDowell's legislation.  It is crazy at a time of an energy crisis that the Government would stand over a situation where 70 turbines are not functioning, not producing electricity and not putting money into the economy.

My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, and my colleague Deputy Quinlivan campaigned successfully to get the Coonagh to Knockalisheen road built.

Colleagues on the Opposition benches need to take ownership of this decision.  It is a Government decision to abandon the northern distributor road.  It sits with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, but as collective Cabinet responsibility, this Government has effectively put the city of Limerick on hold, for God knows how many years.  We have already been waiting more than ten years for this road to be built.  The most ironic part of this is that the whole point of completing the northern distributor road and of hopefully connecting a motorway to Cork which also seems to be abandoned, was to act as a counterweight or a counterbalance for the west coast against the economic juggernaut of Dublin.  The Green Party and this Government have put it on hold so the people of Limerick face nothing more than years more of queueing, traffic, congestion and cars being stuck on the motorway because they cannot access the Mackey Roundabout.  Everyone in Limerick knows this is essential.  I have heard people from all parties bar the Green Party call for this to happen.  It is not going to happen.  The T&aacute;naiste said the door was not closed on the northern distributor road.

The resolution states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tThat the Joint Committee on Autism <blockquote> \t&mdash;notes the evidence of parents of autistic children and other stakeholders about difficulties with the Summer Programme  <\/blockquote>and while not having met all the key stakeholders, given the urgency of the current situation, calls on the Minister for Education to: <blockquote> \t&mdash;ensure that all autistic children will have access to the Summer Programme in 2023;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;ensure that all Special Schools will provide the Summer Programme in 2023;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;provide sufficient resources to schools in order that they may offer a comprehensive provision of the Summer Programme in 2023;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;liaise with the various stakeholders to ensure that increased numbers of schools participate in the Summer Programme, bringing the resources of Schools together where needed, thereby ensuring that a programme is available in every large town in the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;mitigate any constraints to the provision of the Summer Programme including staffing issues such as delays in payment to teachers and SNAs (Special Needs Assistants), resolve any pay anomalies, and to broaden the potential workforce e.g. [employing student] OTs (Occupational Therapists), SLTs (Speech and Language Therapists), early childcare workers, and include suitable student placements; <br \/><br \/>&mdash;mitigate any difficulties with Garda vetting to allow staff to move from one school to another school easily. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>That is coming from a joint committee of all parties putting out our view.  A report will come before both Houses in the next number of weeks.  We want to see a situation where, in 2023, at a minimum every special school has a school-based summer programme.<\/p><p>The Government has put in place &euro;40 million for the programme.  The funding is there.  The principals and the boards of management know that the support will be there.  They need to start organising a programme for summer 2023 now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#P00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>It is my great pleasure to welcome the pupils of Christ the King school in Cork.

It should be specifically about special schools to ring-fence some time on that.  School building responsibilities sit with the Minister, Deputy Foley, whereas special education is with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  We need to balance that because it is about school buildings and then the supports within those buildings.  In Dublin 15, we fought for years to get our special school, Danu.  A committee of parents drove that.  They were promised a dedicated purpose-built building in Dublin 15.  Over the past couple of years, their children have been in accommodation that we thought would be temporary but that may become permanent in Rath Dara.  The demand is still there for a stand-alone purpose-built special school.  It is what those children deserve.<\/p> <p>I received a report in my inbox this morning from two students in Le Ch&eacute;ile school in Tyrellstown, Rebecca and Dalia, who did a report into the status of women versus the status of democracy in Ireland.  They have pulled out some important key points that I wanted to mention.  They disagree with the statement that the status of women reflects the status of democracy in Ireland and I agree with them.  It is surprising the number of people who do not agree with them.  They point to female political representation in Ireland being below the EU average, at 27.7% versus 31.2%; the fact that there are only 36 women in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann compared to 124 men; the gender pay gap is 1% higher than the EU average; and Ireland ranks 17th in the EU concerning political decision-making in respect of women.  They have pulled out some excellent recommendations that we gradually increase gender quotas in the D&aacute;il until it reaches 50%, that gender quotas be introduced in local authorities and that a weekly mandatory CSPE class for senior-cycle students is made mandatory.  Well done to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#P00400","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I welcome the students from Christ the King and, in particular, the teachers here.

They are from a great club called Na Piarsaigh.  I will not call her out because she might be embarrassed but she knows who she is.  They are very welcome.  I commend the Christ the King transition year students here.  It is a tremendous school in Cork and we are lucky to have a school of that calibre in our city.<\/p> <p>I am glad the young women are here today because I want to raise the issue of LGBT rights in Afghanistan.  Yesterday, Deputy Gannon organised a briefing with LGBT Ireland of displaced men and women from Afghanistan who had to leave because of their sexuality.  As Members will be aware, in my case, as an openly gay Member of the House, I have the privilege and the sanctity and the freedom to come in here and speak my mind.  I can disagree with Members about whatever issue but I am free to come in here and speak.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on human rights around the world and on LGBT rights.  We are at a tipping point, in advance of the mid-term elections in America, given what is happening in many parts of the world, especially around Afghanistan where the Taliban, as we speak, are going into villages and asking the elders and families to identify and name their LGBT family members so that they can gain social credit with the Taliban as an example.  Let us think about it in the context of a man or woman who is lesbian, gay or transgender in Afghanistan and imagine having to admit to somebody one is gay, to plan an escape route out of Afghanistan, to go on that journey, and then to reach a point where one seeks and receives sanctuary.  My final point in this request to the Leader is around the issue of visa waivers from the Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I appreciate and accept that we have huge issues around refugees and in respect of housing and availability of accommodation.

Roughly &euro;40 million has been allocated to the programme.  I asked about it and principals came to me with some feedback.  One in four schools rolled the programme out last year but we need more of our mainstream schools doing so as well because we are looking to bring children with special needs into our mainstream schools and for our special schools to handle children with more severe to complex, challenging needs.  It needs to be made clear that, for our special schools, there are more challenging behaviours and that getting new teachers to come in to do the summer programme can be a challenge.  Some of the special schools have looked to see about central vetting processes for SNAs.  This is not about the schools themselves having to go to Garda stations and so on.  Perhaps there should be panels for teachers, particularly for special schools, because additional training may be required as opposed to special classes within mainstream schools.  Those are just some issues for the Minister, who might come in to speak to us, to take into consideration.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise two other matters.  We know about all the families and people living around Rahara and Ballagh, that is, around Lough Funshinagh.  There are the rising flood levels of the turlough.  Senator Murphy has raised this on a number of occasions.  I welcome the group appearing today before the agriculture committee.  Public representatives, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and OPW officials met with the Lough Funshinagh group in July.  Further progress updates on the plans we need to put in place will take place in October.  This is a difficult situation because environmental assessments are required.  The matter has gone down the legal route.  There have been High Court actions.<\/p> <p>Finally, regarding West on Track, and to follow up on Senator Burke's contribution, I attended the meeting in Tuam to which he referred.  This is about how we develop that region and about investment coming into Galway and the west.  The Western Development Commission, the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, NWRA, and the Committee of the Regions attended the meeting.  We need to be conscious that we can provide regional cycleways while also developing our train tracks and bringing investment and tourism into the west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022102600002#Q00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1666776600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Before the Leader replies to the debate, I join in the congratulations Senator Craughwell offered on behalf of everyone to the Cathaoirleach on the distinction granted to him by the Ukrainian Government.

It is lovely when somebody else, not just your own, recognises your brilliance.  I wish the Cathaoirleach congratulations and continued success.<\/p> <p>Senators Dolan, Carrigy, Ahearn and Lombard have looked for probably two debates.  One is about special schools and their locations and, particularly, the length of the journeys some of our children have to make in the morning just to attend a special school in the absence of having one in their own locality.  There was a mooted debate a number of years ago in the Department of Education to make a decision to co-locate a special school on the same grounds as every new school that was being built.  I am not sure if that has gone awry but I will certainly organise a debate on special schools and special education delivery.  Separately, I congratulate Senator Carrigy because the work of the Joint Committee on Autism is coming to a conclusion.  Maybe we will arrange to have a debate between now and Christmas, when the committee's report is due to be published, on the report distinctly and separately from a debate on the special schools building programme.  We will try to do both between now and recess in December.<\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on human rights, specifically LGBT rights, in light of the stories we have heard in recent days of members of the LGBT community fleeing Afghanistan and how horribly they are being treated.<\/p> <p>Senator Currie spoke of a report by two young ladies in Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School.  We like their style and would like to see a lot of what they have asked for implemented.<\/p> <p>Senator Murphy spoke about the horrendous story of the 3,000 young people being used as money mules by criminal gangs.  We need a hell of a lot more debate and research on and, particularly, assistance for people in that age group because they are susceptible to being used, as we can see.  Money is an allure, particularly for young people who do not have any.<\/p> <p>Senator Burke wants a debate on regional balanced development.  We will organise that.  Senator Dolan touched on that matter as well.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan seconded Senator Boylan's amendment to the Order of Business.  I am happy to accept the amendment.  That is no problem at all.  Senator Gavan also asked for a debate on the final report of the NTA, as did Senator Maria Byrne.  I do not think Senator Gavan was here when Senator Byrne was present earlier.  To my mind, something underhand is definitely afoot.  We need to call on the Minister to make a specific statement today on the absence, for the second time, of the northern distributor road, it having been put back in when we brought the matter to his attention the first time.  I have made contact with his office and, therefore, as soon as I have any response I will come back to the Senators.  If, however, we do not get a satisfactory response, I will arrange the debate, in which case I will come back to the Senators beforehand and let them know.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about his pleasure at the election of Rishi Sunak as the new British Prime Minister.  I hope I am not speaking out of turn in saying that I hope to see from today the return of dignity to politics in the United Kingdom, specifically with regard to the relationship that has faltered in recent years, during the terms of the previous two prime ministers.  The thing that gives me a little hope is the number of times during the summer debates Prime Minister Sunak mentioned Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I hope for a return to some respect and dignity in the relationships we share.<\/p> <p>Senator McGahon asked for a debate on Irish Water because of the ongoing two-year disruption and provision of brown water to the people of Dundalk.  He spoke about not only the quality of water but also the quality of responses, or probably the lack of quality responses from Irish Water.  We will try to arrange that debate.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan asked for a debate on the governance and control of arts and literary festivals.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, will be here on 8 November to talk about safe spaces and the arts report, so that might be an opportunity to discuss both matters.  I will come back to the Senator and see if that is acceptable.  If not, we will organise something different.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins expressed her concerns about the order for tomorrow.  I totally take on board what she said and appreciate the concerns she raised.  She also mentioned some issues with Commencement matters.  Other colleagues have raised such issues in recent weeks.  It might be worthwhile for the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight, CPPO, to do an analysis in order that we can see what kind of a response we are getting and from whom.  I can appreciate that it is not acceptable for somebody who just might happen to be on the rota on a particular day to have to come before the House to take a Commencement matter because they will not necessarily know the lie of the land of the Department in question.  We will look at that in the CPPO and come back to the Senators on it.<\/p> <p>Senator Hoey asked for a debate on postgraduate funding and welcomed the review the Minister is doing.  She spoke about the statutory processes ongoing with regard to the metro project and BusConnects.<\/p> <p>Senator Boylan proposed the amendment to the Order of Business and discussed the Bill she hopes to bring forward  soon to discuss what is absolutely unethical behaviour on the part of one of the largest corporations operating in this country.  When we look at lists of the wealthiest institutions, industries and countries, Amazon appears a lot higher on such lists than probably some 40 or 50 countries, so its power is not lost on any of us.  I wish the Senator well with her legislation.<\/p> <p>As I said, Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the removal of the northern distributor road.  I will come back to her and Senator Gavan later.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Defence and the row they are having at the moment about sergeants.  I noted with some amusement Senator Craughwell's request this morning that maybe the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should just take over.  I am sure the Department would be delighted if we all decided that it should take over because it is at the centre of continuous discussions and disagreements with all other Departments.  I will raise the Senator's concerns as he raised them this morning with the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator Chambers talked about the welcome changes to the licensing laws, although there were mixed reviews yesterday.  The thing that probably concerns me the most is that, whether patrons have mixed reviews, they are in charge of their response to the law as to whether they go to the pub later, but those who do not have any responsibility for the changes and for how patrons will act are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I believe we need to see extra resources, particularly around the hours of the extensions.  The really worrying thing - and I agree with what the Senator said about this earlier - is that while we hear that never before have we had as many garda&iacute; in the force, which is true, it is also true that never before have we seen so few of them on our streets.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The growing concerns we have around antisocial behaviour need to be addressed, and I will try to organise a debate on that.<\/p><p>Senator Chambers asked for a debate on wind energy, as did Senator Mullen.
