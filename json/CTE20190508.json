I am accompanied by Dr. Marie Bourke who is head of the council's secretariat and Mr. Manus O'Donnell who is an economist with the council's secretariat.  As the Chairman has said, we recently published the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2019 report that sets out how Ireland is performing on a cost-competitive basis relative to competitor jurisdictions.  A copy of the report has been circulated to the committee.  I look forward to discussing our report this afternoon.  I also intend referring to the research and recommendations to Government in the council's annual report entitled Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge 2018 that we published last December.<\/p> <p>  The National Competitiveness Council was established by Government in 1997 as part of the Partnership 2000 agreement.  The council reports to the Taoiseach and the Government through the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy.  We offer recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland's competitive position.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with the European Council recommendation of September 2016 on the establishment of national productivity boards by euro area countries, in March 2018  the Government designated the council as the body responsible for analysing developments and policies in the field of productivity and competitiveness in Ireland.  The council serves as an independent voice.  In an advisory capacity to Government, it offers recommendations on areas to improve competitiveness and productivity.  The council members serve in a voluntary capacity.  They are appointed by the Minister and drawn from civil society.  These members have an interest in and an understanding of the factors that affect competitiveness and what might improve them.   <\/p> <p>  The work of the council is underpinned by research and analysis providing an evidence base for its policy recommendations.  Each year, in accordance with our terms of reference, we publish a number of reports as follows: the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report is a statistical report that benchmarks key business costs and highlights areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors; Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard provides a comprehensive statistical assessment of Ireland's competitiveness performance, including a wider range of metrics and indicators other than costs; Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge uses the information generated in the reports to outline the main challenges to Irish competitiveness; and we produce a productivity statement that tracks the productivity performance of the Irish economy.  We also produce a series of short two or three-page competitiveness bulletins, submissions and other papers on specific competitiveness issues such as electricity, insurance, legal and rankings.  In the past the council has made submissions to the Action Plan for Jobs and, more recently, the plan called Future Jobs 2019. <\/p> <p>  Ireland's ability to compete in international trade and sell our goods and services abroad is a key determinant of our wages, living standards and ability to finance social services like health, social protection and education.  It allows our economy to be a successful member of the eurozone and withstand the shocks that are beyond our control.  Competitiveness is part of the DNA of sustainable jobs.  If we want to provide and sustain good, well-paid jobs for our citizens and ensure that these are sustainable then maintaining our competitive edge is crucial.<\/p> <p>  Competitiveness is a complex concept and results from many factors.  Along with labour-force participation, two of the principal factors determining competitiveness performance are productivity and cost-competitiveness.  In the medium term productivity improvement will be the primary driver of competitiveness, employment, wages, living standards and the financing of public services.<\/p><p> Costs are a key element of national competitiveness.  Maintaining cost competitiveness is critical to the overall competitiveness of firms based in Ireland and to maintain the virtuous circle between the cost of living, productivity growth and wage rates.  If costs in Ireland are too high relative to productivity, it damages Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and threatens jobs.  Irish businesses would find it more difficult to export and internationally mobile firms would be disincentivised from locating here.  Ultimately, prohibitive costs would make international trade and investment more expensive, reducing the economy&rsquo;s beneficial exposure to the international economy.  To be competitive, however, an economy does not need to be low-cost if it can find ways to boost productivity.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s overall economic performance indicates that we are continuing to maintain a strong competitiveness position.  The recovery has continued apace.  Economic growth is strong and unemployment is relatively low.  This is very good news.  However, as the economy continues to grow, ensuring our model is sustainable and balanced takes on even more significance.  The risks to Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity are increasing.  International economic uncertainty and the return to protectionist trade policies in certain key global economies, along with developments in US tax policy and an evolving international tax landscape, pose a threat to our future economic growth and stability.  Domestically, a fraction of firms provide the major part of Ireland&rsquo;s productivity performance, value added, exports and corporate tax receipts, disguising the majority of underperforming firms where productivity growth is stagnant or falling.  The narrow range of exporters, products and services exported, and the reliance on a small number of export markets, pose serious concerns.<\/p><p> The vulnerabilities in the fabric of the economy, coupled with the challenging global environment, endanger the hard-won medium-term sustainability of our economy.  It has never been more important in the economic life of our country that we recognise these vulnerabilities, and that government policy strengthens our productivity performance and competitiveness to secure Ireland&rsquo;s future prosperity.<\/p><p> The council tracks the three main international competitiveness indicators for Ireland.  While Ireland still ranks highly in these indices, we have been falling down the rankings in recent years.  In the 2018 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook Report, Ireland is ranked 12th, a fall of six places on the 2017 rankings.  In addition, Ireland fell six places from 17th to 23rd in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report 2019.  Ireland is ranked 23rd out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report.<\/p><p> The council&rsquo;s competitiveness challenge report, published in December 2018, identifies a range of recommendations that address both immediate competitiveness issues, and more medium-term challenges aimed at enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and productivity performance.  As in previous years, the council has sought to strike a balance between addressing issues that are well-known, housing, climate action and the availability of talent, with challenges that are emerging, such as traffic congestion, and the combined hidden costs of proposed regulation, for example the new water tariff regime, water abstraction, work-life balance and pension reform.  Three overarching themes are considered to address what I have just raised: ensuring the sustainability of the economic model; maintaining cost competitiveness; and narrowing the productivity gap between the best and the rest.  We may be able to talk about these later.<\/p><p> The council published the Cost of Doing Business in Ireland report on 12 April.  As mentioned, the report has two main aims: to flag any areas where business costs in Ireland are out-of-line with our international competitors; and to build the evidence base for the next competitiveness challenge document, which makes recommendations regarding those areas of policy emphasis to deal with competitiveness issues.  The report achieves this by benchmarking the costs of doing business in Ireland relative to international competitors using the latest available data on various cost indicators.  It is a statistical exercise.  The report describes the overall cost profile in Ireland as \"high-cost, slowly increasing\".  In 2018, prices in Ireland increased by 0.7%.  This was the slowest rate of inflation of all euro area economies, and it was the joint slowest rate of price increases in the EU.  Inflation was faster than in previous years, but still well below the price growth rate for the euro area as a whole and the UK.  Our low growth being below comparator countries is very welcome from a cost-competitiveness perspective.  However, we note that Ireland remains an expensive location.  So, while average prices are increasing slowly, they are doing so from a comparatively high base.  We need to avoid too much focus on averages.<\/p><p> The report identifies a number of emerging pressure points in our economy which have the potential to significantly erode our competitiveness further.  The major cost factors for Irish businesses are labour costs, the rental price of commercial property, interest rates and the continued increase in insurance costs.  Labour costs are broadly in line with the euro area average but above those in the UK.  They grew by 2.9% in 2018, four times faster than the rate of inflation.  Labour costs vary considerably between different sectors in Ireland.  The latest EUROSTAT data show that labour costs in certain sectors of our economy are also out of line with UK and euro area.  For example, labour costs in the utility sector are &euro;53 per hour in Ireland compared with &euro;37 per hour in the UK and &euro;48 per hour in the euro area.  In the ICT sector, labour costs are &euro;47 per hour in Ireland, &euro;35 per hour in the UK and &euro;41 per hour in the euro area.  In 2018 in most sectors of the economy labour costs were greater than, or equal to, those in the UK.  Hourly labour costs in Ireland grew by 6.1%, 4.5% and 4.3% in the ICT, construction and financial sectors, respectively, compared with 4.1%, 5.4% and 2.4% in the UK.<\/p><p> Residential property prices are now roughly where they were at the start of 2005.  The average rent in Dublin was &euro;1,527 in quarter 1 of 2018.  Rents have been growing since 2013 and have been increasing by over 5% per annum for the past four years.  Over the past year, there has also been a steady increase in commercial property prices and the cost of constructing office space.  In 2018, the construction cost per square metre of a prime office building in Dublin was $3,065, lower than in London but above that which applies in cities such as Amsterdam and Munich.  In the office rental market, in the past five years prices have increased by 15.9% in Dublin suburbs and by 16.5% in Galway.<\/p><p> In recent years, aggregate transport sector prices in Ireland have increased moderately.  In 2018, the average prices per litre of petrol and diesel were &euro;1.43 and &euro;1.34, respectively.  Over the course of 2018, petrol prices increased by 2.8% and the price of diesel increased by 4.6%.  Traffic has increased across the road network and traffic congestion in the cities has worsened as highlighted by the fact that 11% of all commuters spent an hour or more commuting to work in 2017, the most recent data available.  At the same time the congestion level in Dublin was higher than major European cities such as London, Paris and Brussels.  This is a form of hidden inflation which is not picked up in price indexes.<\/p><p> Utility prices have fallen due to the reduction in global oil prices.  Electricity prices in Ireland have fallen since the first half of 2014 but in the first six months of 2018 remained higher than the UK and euro area average.  Similarly, gas prices here have also fallen since the first six months of 2014.  However, the fall was lower than in the euro area and the UK, which points to a relative competitiveness loss.<\/p><p> Businesses in Ireland face higher interest rates than the average business in the euro area.  The cost of credit remains very high compared with the euro average.  In 2014, Irish companies faced a similar interest rate, 3%, to counterparts in Germany and France, whereas now the rate is higher for Irish companies at 3.3% and lower in those economies at 2%.  This means that Irish businesses face costs that are 65% higher than their EU counterparts.<\/p><p> The service sector continues to be the main source of upward price pressure, as it has continued to rise since early 2015.  The CSO services producer price index, which measures changes in the average level of prices charged by producers, shows that prices for a range of business services, such as freight transport, postal and courier activities, computer programming and consultancy, legal, accounting, advertising and market research services have been increasing in Ireland.  In the year to 2018, service producer prices increased by 3.1% in Ireland and were 7% higher relative to 2015.  In comparison, the corresponding figures for euro area were 1% and 1.8%.<\/p><p> The average tax rate for those earning the average income is low compared with other OECD countries.  However, the marginal rate for a person earning the average wage is the second highest marginal tax rate at 49% among the high-income OECD countries.  The council acknowledges the measure introduced in budget 2019 which raised the entry point for the higher rate of income tax from &euro;34,550 to &euro;35,300 for a single worker.  We must continue to reform our tax system and make it internationally competitive so that Ireland continues to attract highly qualified talent to these shores.<\/p><p> The Cost of Doing Business in Ireland 2019 report gathers information and provides a snapshot of the cost profile in Ireland.  It is a significant input into the subsequent analysis of policy implications and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, which are included in our report, Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge, published annually.  In the challenge report we published last December, these were addressed under the theme of maintaining cost competitiveness, along with other recommendations to address the challenges under the other two themes of: ensuring the sustainability of the economic model; and narrowing the productivity gap between the best and the rest.<\/p><p> Some of the key recommendations relating to cost competitiveness, included in the report, relate to: measures to address housing affordability through the intensified delivery of housing supply measures in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan; expediting the implementation of the recommendations from the cost of insurance working group; the need to develop sectoral-level data on water and waste; and the development of a more comprehensive and representative data set on the cost of legal services.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the Government's commitment to improving Ireland&rsquo;s productivity and competitiveness through various policies and initiatives including the actions to be progressed in 2019 in the Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Ireland initiative.<\/p><p>The council welcomes publication by the Government of the plan and believes it will be an important policy document in framing enterprise and economic policy in the years ahead.  The council will continue to advocate for competitiveness and productivity to be central pillars of economic policy.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members for affording the council the opportunity to meet them.

The cost of insurance has been a major issue for the National Competitiveness Council for a number of years.  In 2016 we were out of the blocks very early in saying there was a problem.  We produced a bulletin entitled, Action Required to Address Insurance Cost Competitiveness, in which we highlighted all of the main issues that we saw.  We made a series of recommendations in the report about assigning greater priority to improving insurance cost competitiveness and creating a comprehensive benchmark for insurance costs in order that we could see what was happening.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy had asked about the data.  The bulletin argued that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, should be properly empowered to collect the required claims data in order that we could properly assess what was happening.  There was also mention of non-attendance for medicals.  We spoke much about the reform of the legal profession and how it could contribute to the reduction in insurance costs.  The cost of insurance working group was established afterwards.  We have since mentioned in our challenge reports the implementation of recommendations in the first phase in respect of motor, employer's and public liability insurance.  We have also made recommendations on some of the other reports that were produced at the same time.<\/p> <p>  In the case of motor insurance, Central Statistics Office, CSO, data suggest prices increased rapidly from 2015, peaking in quarter 3 of 2016.  They demonstrate that they have since dropped.  According to the most recent figures, the cost of motor insurance was 4% higher than in 2015.  Taken together, that represents a 32% increase since 2013, which is dramatic.  When compared with prices elsewhere in the European Union, prices in Ireland increased much faster from 2013 to their peak in 2016.  Therefore, the rate of price increases has been much greater than in other areas.<\/p> <p>  I can speak about a series of other recommendations if the committee so desires, but there is a difficulty.  It was not mentioned in our cost of doing business report because it was a statistical exercise and we use international data to compare costs here with those in our international competitors.  We use the best available data, but the problem is there are many data limitations with respect to insurance costs.  In the absence of official statistics we do not want to publish data that are not correct.  We only have that overall motor insurance picture.  We have set out a series of recommendations for how the data could be improved in order t hat we could make better judgments.  The anecdotes suggest insurance costs are a big problem.  We have certainly demonstrated that the cost of motor insurance has been a big problem which has only just started to top out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>What were the recommendations made in compiling the data?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#H00500","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>In March, after much pushing by us and others, the CSO published a report on the feasibility of collecting price information on the cost of insurance to business.

I also mentioned vulnerability in the economy.  For the four and a half years I have been chairman of the council it has been pushing heavily on the productivity picture.  Originally we did not have data to demonstrate clearly the problem we had.  Approximately the top 10% of firms in Ireland account for 80% of the added value in manufacturing and 94% in services.  The top 15 commodities account for 90% of the total goods exported from Ireland.  The top 100 traders account for 80% of exports value, with 10% of firms accounting for 90% of productivity.  As I stated, we are flying on one big engine and must work strongly on the smaller engine.<\/p> <p>  In our challenge we place particular emphasis on narrowing the productivity gap between the best and the rest, which is our third theme.  We focus very heavily on the challenges facing small firms which are the least likely to be able to invest in the management talent they need to make good decisions.  They are also the least likely to be able to invest in having a good strategy and company training, which is incredibly important for productivity.  They are least likely to be able to invest in research and development.  There is also a hangover from the crisis as firms deleverage because they have run up large debts; it is arguable that they are not taking on enough debt to invest in the activities that would help them to develop.<\/p> <p>  We focus on the presence of the talent pipeline, in particular, and ensuring there can be such a pipeline in the higher and further education areas.  This concerns support for low-skilled workers who are at risk of displacement by changing technology to retrain and upskill through the apprenticeship system.  There is also a heavy focus on digital skills, as approximately half the population are not suitably equipped with digital skills.  That is a threat not only to our firms today but also to employment in the future.  It is a significant area of policy that we have emphasised for the Government.<\/p> <p>  There should be investment in infrastructure, an area in which we have lagged behind somewhat in comparison with other countries, although Project Ireland 2040 will result in much more infrastructure being built.  What is of concern in that respect is the very low level of productivity in the construction sector.  There are also delays and I am sure there will be mention of the national broadband plan.  The delay in bringing broadband to towns is particularly challenging for smaller companies.<\/p> <p>  We have made specific recommendations on top of the more general recommendations.  We have recommended that the Government produce a productivity action plan.  It has been referred to in the Future Jobs Ireland 2019 plan and we are very pleased that has been taken on board.  The plan should be developed further through the agencies in order to reduce our reliance on a small number of companies.  We have also recommended aligning Ireland's capital gains tax entrepreneur relief which is aimed at entrepreneurs running companies so as to extend the lifetime limit of &euro;1 million to &euro;10 million on gains made in disposing of business assets.  That would give smaller companies a greater fighting chance.  An implementation plan should be prepared to intensify business research and development activity and there should be regular reviews of the barriers and enablers to increase investment in what we call knowledge-based capital but what is essentially innovation and research and development.  We should also strengthen links between indigenous companies and multinationals.  We have seen a decline in the spillover of knowledge from very high-end companies to the following companies.<\/p><p>We are not the only country where this is happening but we are a highly globalised economy and because of that we are quite reliant on this small number of large companies.  There was always a reliance in the economy but we are very reliant upon a small number.  We have also asked to review the effectiveness of the global sourcing initiative.  This is the initiative that helps to introduce indigenous companies to those buyers from the multinational companies in order to create better and stronger linkages between our excellent multinational sector of large companies and our smaller companies.  Those are our main recommendations for areas where Government needs to enhance policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I have another question but I am happy to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#J00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Deputy has enough time if he wants to go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#J00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I refer to some of the barriers to participation in the workforce.

The Deputy has covered both in his question.  Childcare is something the council identified early.  Our contributions on childcare were reflected in the affordable childcare scheme that was then rolled out by Government.  It is essential, not only for productivity but also to create an equitable society and to create thriving and sustainable communities.  We have looked at the evidence around the importance of quality childcare for long lasting benefits for children, women, families, the economy and society at large so it is even bigger than the competitiveness story as the Deputy knows very well.  It is essentially a major indirect cost to business when people have to pay for it and it is leading to difficulties in attracting and retaining staff; to the loss of skilled labour in the economy; and, to people leaving the workforce because there is a lot of churn in the workforce.<\/p> <p>  Our data show that the average cost of childcare varies considerably across the regions and across the types of childcare used.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and Pobal data show that childcare costs are particularly high in Dublin, east Leinster and other urban areas, relative to the rest of the country.  The average hourly cost of childcare for a single child, depending on the type of childcare, is as follows: for a childminder in the family home it is &euro;6.13 per hour; for a childminder outside the home it is &euro;4.76 per hour; and, for centre-based care it is &euro;4.82 per hour.  The data also show that mothers facing higher childcare costs work fewer hours.  They may have a job but they will work fewer hours.  Also, a 10% increase in childcare costs is associated with 30 minutes less paid work by mothers per week.  The relationship can be seen very clearly there to answer the Deputy's question.<\/p> <p>  The high costs and limited accessibility of quality childcare are generally attributed to childhood poverty and lower female labour market participation rates.  For couples earning 167% of the average wage, Ireland is the second most expensive country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, for childcare-related expenses and for lone parents earning 67% of the average wage, Ireland is the most expensive OECD location so it is a significant effect on our competitiveness.<\/p> <p>  The single affordable childcare scheme was welcome in providing subsidies with the aim of replacing existing non-statutory childcare schemes and providing subsidies to parents of preschool children.  Those targeted subsidies are payable for children up to six months of age.  The continuation of a universal subsidy is to be payable for children between the age of six and 36 months.  The key point here is that there is a plan.  It needs to be rolled out and implemented as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>On our productivity figures, how distorted would Professor Clinch say Irish productivity figures are by the presence and domination of a small number of information technology, IT, multinationals?

We are right up the top of the class in how good our performance is on labour productivity particularly.  To be fair to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, they were very supportive of us when we argued strongly to encourage the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to produce more detailed data that would allow us strip out multinationals.  It is not just multinationals however, we should say leading companies because for example, in the food sector and in pharma we have large, successful companies so it is not quite as simple as foreign versus domestic.  Let us say it is close to that but we give credit to some of the Irish companies.  We have stripped that out so that we can look at the figures on productivity and I will give the Deputy a couple of those.  Labour productivity in foreign dominated sectors grew by almost 140% between 2000 and 2014.  That is a 6.5% annual figure but when we look at the domestic and other sectors, it saw an increase in productivity of just 50% over the same period.  That is 140% compared to 50%.  What is even more disturbing now is that we are seeing declining or stagnant productivity in most of the non-leading companies.  As I said, what is seen is essentially 90% of our productivity performance driven by 10% of the firms.  We have the data to show the issue.  The question is how do we start to address that problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>As a follow-on from that, would Professor Clinch say that too many of the tax credits, tax reliefs and supports are essentially benefiting that 10% of firms and that we need to radically and dramatically shift supports and expenditures into areas that will boost the domestic economy and reduce those costs, unlock those bottlenecks and so on rather than continuing to direct an awful lot of it towards those 10%?

My first response is not to switch off that engine until the other one is firing strongly.  That is how I would answer it in a colloquial sense.  Inward investment will always be a major part of our economic model and it has been hugely successful in importing productivity into Ireland.  It is the case that our productivity levels elsewhere in the economy among our domestic firms would be worse if we had not had the investment of those countries over the years and if those companies had not been provided with the incentives to do so.  They do not need to be mutually exclusive.  It will always be beneficial.  All of the research suggests that having a strong, innovation-intensive sector that is highly skilled not only provides a valuable sector to corporate taxes and so on in itself but it also results in spillovers to the other companies as people move back and forth between large companies and small companies.<\/p><p>Dell was an interesting example of a company that went out of business eventually and was probably at the lower-skilled end yet it produced some fantastic people who have gone on to set up other companies.  That sector is important, therefore, and it is important to support it.  Nevertheless, the Deputy is correct that the other sector also needs to be supported strongly in being able to use some of these incentives, such as tax credits, to invest in innovation, research and design, talent and in-company training.  There is much policy in this area, with Enterprise Ireland working hard to support that sector and send people on management training programmes to give them the types of information they need.  In the case of Brexit, for example, they can be helped to develop the types of supply chains that might help to protect them from Brexit and to open new markets.  There are many different schemes available to help them to do that.  The one area I consider difficult is the large proportion of employment which is provided by companies with two or three people and which might not even be internationally traded.  It is very hard to persuade those people, who work long hours to keep their business going, to take time off to think about their strategy, how they will retrain and so on.  As a council, we continually examine models from elsewhere to show what could be done in that area but it remains a challenge and there is no easy answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#J00900","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Much of it is about education and investment therein.

How does Professor Clinch expect those areas to be addressed?  Workers have no choice but to make pay demands if they cannot meet those costs.  In all those areas, it seems the market is just not capable of reducing those costs.  In housing, it is clear the market is not reducing costs and there is no sign it will do so in the near future.  I do not see how transport costs will fall if they are left to the market, while I do not see, realistically, how childcare costs will decrease.

I should be clear that while the overall price level is low, part of our job is to ensure we do not just consider averages, as in the case of productivity.  The main pinch points are in the areas of housing, traffic congestion, private transport, childcare and several others, which we have pointed out.  The Deputy is correct that an enormous current challenge for policy is how to reduce the cost of living, which is difficult because the Government does not have control over all prices and markets are at work.  The danger is that when one intervenes in the market and introduces subsidies, prices will be driven up further, meaning that the consumer will not benefit.  We should always be careful, therefore, about the intervention we make to ensure that will not happen.<\/p> <p>  To control prices, we have considered measures where the Government can make a difference.  It controls prices in areas such as water, postal services and road and rail transport.  There is some control in that regard and they are mainly administered prices.  There are also hidden areas of prices, such as in the planning system and so on, where the Government can make a difference.  We tend to examine matters such as what reduces efficiencies.  In the case of legal fees, for example, the evidence suggests that Ireland has higher prices relative to other jurisdictions.  We recommended that the Government examine conflict resolution systems in countries with a similar judicial system to find whether there are ways to speed up tasks in commercial disputes.  We have also recommended expediting the recommendations of the review of the administration of civil justice when it is released.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about insurance costs in 2016 and produced a bulletin on it.  Establishing the cost of insurance working group and subsequent ones will make a difference, although we are still waiting for more recommendations to emerge.  While access to credit is difficult, it is a big issue for business more than the consumer, although it is an issue for the consumer in respect of mortgages and loans.  A significant hangover of the financial crisis affects access to credit.  At one stage, access was difficult but now the cost of credit is much higher.  We have pushed the Government hard to increase the range of financing options for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and to create awareness of matters such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, whose credit guarantee scheme can help.  Ultimately, the only way to push prices down in areas such as housing is to increase the level of construction, of which Rebuilding Ireland is a major and important part.  The council would not go as far as to recommend directly whether there should be more State intervention, but we must always bear in mind that some of those models and experiences have not always worked so well.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the Deputy is correct.  As we have outlined repeatedly, to have a successful, sustainable economy, without such wage growth that it cannot be sustained in the economy, as happened in the run-up to the crisis, we must ensure that it is underpinned by productivity and keep the costs of living down.

Many of the questions I had intended to ask have been asked but I will elaborate on them.  The various issues raised, analysed and scrutinised by the council to compare and contrast Ireland with international norms of taxation, transport and other issues are fine, and the council stated the economy is performing reasonably well, save for some labour cost worries.  That leads me to believe that the council is examining mainly large manufacturing industry and business.  As my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, indicated in an earlier question, the examples and representations we receive on the ground relate to SMEs in the main, that is, those in the service industry or selling their wares within their local economy and region.  I refer to hotels, bars and leisure centres.<\/p><p>The big issue for them is insurance.  Insurance is crippling small industries and putting them out of business.  I would have thought and expected that any reports about competitiveness in this country, carried out by any body, would have at its core major recommendations on insurance.  I am somewhat surprised that that is not the case.  I am aware that Professor Clinch has said that he provided a previous report that fed into the body that in turn made recommendations to the Government.  We are doing our best to help the Government by bringing forward relevant legislation to address that issue.  It has to be at the forefront of every report compiled by those who say they represent business.  Is there any part of the professor's role that deals directly with smaller businesses?  Does he carry out relevant and necessary research, including questionnaires and focus groups?  If not, why not?  That is the feedback we are getting, and we want the professor to respond to the concerns of that group.  It leads me to believe that there is an over-focus on one section of the economy while small indigenous businesses that are selling here are ignored.  That leapt out at me from this report.  Can the Professor respond, assuring us and those we represent that he is as committed to and as worried about the impact of the cost of insurance for people doing business?  It affects the industries I have mentioned, and the next phase will concern education and school facilities and festivals in towns and regions which communities depend upon to kickstart the tourist season, among other things.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#K00600","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Deputy has challenged me fairly, and I will respond robustly.  We are absolutely not focused solely on the large manufacturing or services companies trading here.  We have put out a lot of information about it.  We will make big mistakes if we just look at top line data.  We spend a lot of time looking at the micro data, but the problem is getting that data.  The cost of doing business report is a purely statistical report.  We have to be able to compare the data internationally, and we do not have that data so it is not included in the report.  We have representation from the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the Small Firms Association on our council.  We are a product of social partnership so there are an interesting variety of views around the table.  We manage to produce something sensible from the variety of views by following the data, and make sure that we only say things that are based on fact.  That makes it very difficult in areas where the data are poor.  However, I assure the Deputy that we were very early out of the blocks on the issue of insurance, and followed the information that was coming to us from the organisations on our board concerning insurance.  We produced a bulletin which has led to many changes.  We used the statistical report to then make recommendations in the Challenge report.  The data are poor; our principal recommendation is to get better data.  I urge everyone here to push the CSO for better data on insurance and legal services.  It is very hard to get.  It is hard for us to make the kind of points we want to make and the types of points the Deputy has made without having firm evidence.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is quite right to say that there is plenty of personal experience of serious difficulties in obtaining insurance and the cost of that insurance when obtained.  I had an argument with my insurance company over motor insurance, in fact; I had to tell it what the data were and that it should have gone down rather than up.  Just because the average price seems to go down it does not mean that prices are increasing for people.  We have made many different recommendations around insurance.  In the December 2018 challenge report the main recommendations were to continue the implementation of the outstanding cost to employer and public liability insurance report recommendations, which address the issue of transparency in the insurance industry; to establish a standardised and internationally recognised approach to diagnose, treat and report on soft tissue injuries, as recommended by the Personal Injuries Commission, in order to improve transparency, comparability and efficiency of the personal injury claims system in Ireland; and to undertake more regular reviews of the book of quantum and provide a greater degree of granularity in terms of injury compensation data. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy has made a good point about the statistical report.  To address the issue he raised, we should probably include in our reports a box outlining what we were not able to report on and what we are concerned about.

There is a lot happening underneath the hood.  The Chairman is quite right.  We might have a low inflation rate but we are coming from a high base.<\/p> <p>  It is always difficult in terms of how we operate.  There are so many things at work that underpin how an economy works, from particular sectoral and overall pay agreements through to us being a price taker in so many areas: our dependence on imported energy for example.  We are also a small economy so we do not get the economies of scale that other economies get.  There are also areas that are very difficult to compare.  We just had a great conversation about the importance of data.  It is very hard to compare, for example, administrative costs in the planning system because it is quite difficult to assess what they are.<\/p> <p>  One of Ireland's biggest challenges is in the boom-and-bust cycles we have had over the years.  As a highly globalised economy, we tend to have some large growth periods and then, as we saw recently, some significant downturns.  In the last downturn we saw a dramatic correction in costs.  Because of cyclical cost competitiveness adjustment the economy crashed and all of a sudden there was more supply of products, services, housing and property.  Prices were pushed down and we had a major competitiveness correction as well as some very beneficial external factors that were beyond our control.<\/p> <p>  We should also remember we had a very good capital stock as we came out of the crash.  Large investment in our roads and other infrastructure had happened in the run-up to the crisis.  Therefore when we emerged we were able to grow at a very fast rate yet not have price rises for a few years.  There may have been a failure to anticipate how quickly we would grow and how quickly we needed to invest in certain areas of the economy, particularly in capital spending which had taken a huge cut and is still well below our competitor countries even with the Project Ireland 2040 plan put in place.<\/p> <p>  Infrastructure spending and spending on innovation, research and development - in other words soft and hard infrastructure - are critical for providing productivity growth in areas where we cannot control prices and might be a price taker.  When it comes to economic policy a sustainable macro-environment is very important for competitiveness.  If there are big ups and downs in GDP growth and the performance in the economy, we will have big variations in the price level and essentially, as is happening now, we inevitably lose competitiveness as prices increase.  <\/p> <p>  The good news would be if essentially the economic growth rate slows but we do not, as we did previously, go beyond our productivity performance and find ourselves on an unsustainable path.

At one point prior to the crash, we priced ourselves out of entire sections of markets yet there now seems to be a willingness to go back to that pricing structure again.  It is not related to insurance or other factors.  It is an actual pricing structure in which people seem to think that as long as they can get X, they will charge X even if that means the industry suffers overall as a result.

In the end we produced a study to examine the affordability of Irish housing.<\/p> <p>  We came out strongly on childcare costs as we discussed.  We came out particularly early on legal services and on insurance.  We also raised the awareness of the high cost of credit and not just availability.  We have also got cost and competitiveness included in areas of Government policy where people might not have thought it was an important strand.  For example, competitiveness is one of the pillars in the White Paper on energy even though it had not been when it emerged in the first instance.<\/p><p>We also were involved in the implementation group of Food Wise 2025 and we called for competitiveness to be an important part of it.<\/p><p> On national infrastructure, we have heavily focused on coherence, co-ordinated delivery and monitoring of both the national planning framework and the Government's capital plan.  We need to properly assess how we prioritise investment and there needs to be a decision making process on how to change course if something changes.  If an enormous international economic recession comes along, we need to be able to ask if we are investing in the right areas or if we need to do something different.  Agility in decision making is critical.  In the national mitigation plan we have emphasised the need to competitiveness-proof the key areas of climate and energy.  Our emphasis on productivity was raised by two Deputies and has been taken on board by Government in its future jobs plan.  It is important to make sure the plan is effective and is delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before us and for their answers today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019050800002#N00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557270000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 4 p.m. until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 14 May 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health","time":1557270000,"counter":54},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 11:00<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 11:00<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Seanad\u00f3ir\u00ed \/ Senators Stephen Donnelly, Colm Burke, Bernard J.

I would like to introduce Ms Edina O'Driscoll, project manager for the neurorehabilitation demonstrator project.  She is here in a voluntary capacity at our invitation in order to address any queries on this project which I will mention in the course of my statement.<\/p> <p>  Over 800,000 Irish people are living with neurological conditions, ranging from common conditions such as migraine, dementia and epilepsy to rare neurological disease, with approximately 40,000 additional people diagnosed each year.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, is the national advocacy group for neurological care, representing over 30 patient organisations.  We work closely with the Disability Federation of Ireland in promoting recognition of the need for community supports for people living with neurological conditions and the vital role played by voluntary organisations, including MS Ireland, in providing these services.<\/p> <p>  I wish to briefly highlight an issue which I do not have sufficient time to deal with in detail but which continues to impact significantly on people with neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, MS.  I refer to access to medicines.  The NAI supports the call by the Medical Research Charities Group and the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry for the development and implementation of a national strategy on access to new and innovative medicines.  The remainder of my statement will focus on the specific challenges in accessing neurology and neurorehabilitation services and call for investment in a series of specific projects which the NAI believes could make a significantly positive impact.<\/p> <p>  Neurorehabilitation services are critical to support recovery and prevent disability for people with neurological conditions.  The ongoing lack of access to specialist rehabilitation continues to have a devastating impact on individuals and their families, resulting in unnecessary disability and impinging on the precious potential for recovery.  Ireland has less than half of the specialist inpatient beds needed for its population and community-based services are totally underdeveloped, with only three community healthcare organisations, CHOs, having dedicated, but still only partially staffed, community neurorehabilitation teams.<\/p> <p>  A three-year implementation framework for the 2011 national policy and strategy for neurorehabilitation services was finally published by the HSE in February.  While implementation of this framework is included as a key action within the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan, this will be impossible without dedicated funding.  A critical starting point is the need for investment in the neurorehabilitation demonstrator project.  This project is an innovative collaboration between acute hospitals, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, the Royal Hospital Donnybrook, Peamount Healthcare, local voluntary providers and primary care to develop a managed clinical rehabilitation network which will improve access to specialist neurorehabilitation for people in CHO areas 6 and 7.  This is not just about introducing a new service, this pilot project is fully in line with the aims of Sl&aacute;intecare to provide an integrated approach to the management of chronic neurological conditions, reducing length of stay in acute hospitals, saving bed days and most importantly, ensuring that people receive the right care in the right place when they need it.<\/p> <p>  I want to move on to a series of proposed projects to address the challenges in neurology services.  The neurology clinical programme recognises that over 20,000 patients are awaiting neurological evaluation, of whom at least 30% suffer from headache.  Headache represents the second most frequent condition presenting to acute medical assessment units.  In response to this, and in collaboration with the Irish Pharmacy Union and the Migraine Association of Ireland, the neurology programme has developed a new pathway of care that will expedite headache management to a community-focused model in an innovative, quality driven and cost-effective way in line with the aims of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The neurology programme also recognises that many neurological diseases are rare, requiring national centres of expertise.  Therefore, an innovative, agile and sustainable management plan has been developed using motor neurone disease as a model, that integrates care across the hospital community and capitalises on the expertise of the voluntary sector to provide high-quality, evidence-based, streamlined care for patients from diagnosis to end of life.<\/p><p> Finally, the neurology programme recognises the importance of providing evidence-based, disease-modifying treatments in a cost-effective manner for neurological disease.  The programme is developing an evidence-based treatment pathway for multiple sclerosis that can be replicated for other neurological diseases for which new, highly effective but costly treatments are anticipated.<\/p><p> The NAI is calling for investment in the initiatives outlined as a key opportunity to begin to address the huge challenges faced by people living with neurological conditions.  All the proposals are fully costed and ready for implementation.  Detailed descriptions have already been circulated to the committee or are available on request.  The NAI wishes to stress that a commitment to ongoing investment in neurology and neurorehabilitation services needs to be a key part of any future programme for Government.  We look forward to working with the committee in shaping future policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Magdalen Rogers","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>We are very grateful for the invitation to address the committee and represent the needs of two groups of people, namely those individuals and families affected by a spectrum of neurocognitive disorders known as alcohol-related brain injury, ARBI, and those impacted upon by a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders widely referred to as foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Paula Leonard, from the Alcohol Forum.  Ours is a national charity that provides support, information and services to people, families and communities impacted upon by alcohol harm.  I am Dr. Helen McMonagle, and I am speaking in the first instance in my capacity as a rehabilitation co-ordinator for people affected by a condition that is largely excluded in many national dialogues regarding alcohol, disability and neurorehabilitation in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  ARBI is a brain injury that is acquired as a result of the toxic effect of alcohol on the brain and the nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition that often accompany this pattern of alcohol use.  Over the past seven years of providing support in respect of this condition, I have seen, at first hand, the devastating range of brain-based difficulties that result from ARBI, including difficulties with memory, attention, planning, reasoning and judgment, all of which interfere with a person's ability to lead an independent life.  ARBI prevents people from overcoming problems with addiction and exposes them to a range of personal and social vulnerabilities, including risks to their health, safety and personal well-being.  This perfect storm of addiction and reduced cognitive capabilities, alongside poor identification rates, results in a vicious cycle of repeated hospital admissions and worsening prognoses for those affected.  Four recent reports - the intercollegiate report from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, General Practitioners, Physicians and Neurologists of England and Northern Ireland and reports from the Scottish Executive, Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government - highlight the growing concerns surrounding the increasing numbers of men and women in their 40s, 50s and 60s developing this brain injury as a result of alcohol use, and calls for support services to be urgently developed to meet their rehabilitative needs.  Our local research, which we submitted to the committee, and our ongoing work to support people in the CHO 1 area, continue to highlight the health service limbo in which these individuals exist.  This condition belongs to no one HSE directorate.  It is a condition for which there is no leadership, strategic planning or care pathway for in our country.  This is very difficult to comprehend when a recent review of the numbers shows that this condition has had a &euro;6 million burden in three acute hospitals in the CHO 1 area over the last five years.  It has been shown internationally to contribute significantly to the burden of dementia, particularly early onset dementia, a large portion of the homeless population, and affects between 0.4% and 2.8% of the general population.  One person in eight is dependent on alcohol.<\/p> <p>  The committee must know that people with ARBI have no natural advocates.  They will not self-present to their GPs, local Deputies or the media in order to highlight the inequity that exists for this condition.  There is no professional group taking the baton and speaking on their behalf.<\/p><p>Our work with local services in Donegal mirrors the findings of many other sites internationally, namely, that providing targeted supports in this area results in better outcomes for people affected and a reduction in the cost burden relating to the condition. Having just one case co-ordinator, a local care pathway and a willingness among local services to work with people with the condition in the county, we have freed up the equivalent of one bed in our local hospital for two and a half years, or 939 fewer bed days.  In cost terms, Letterkenny University Hospital has spent &euro;850,000 less than Sligo University Hospital and &euro;700,000 less than Cavan General Hospital responding to this condition in the past five years.<\/p><p> We know that the detrimental impact of this condition extends beyond the people of Donegal and is a problem across the whole island of Ireland.  I am here today to make one request, namely, that this committee mirror the efforts of the Scottish Government and Welsh Government in this area and the intercollegiate efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  We ask members to support the establishment of a national working group to scope the needs of this population in an Irish context and deliver recommendations and a strategy to this committee as to the best way to respond to the growing needs of the cohort of affected persons.  Without that scrutiny and oversight, my fear is that people with ARBI will continue to perish in silence, being passed from pillar to post and with each service director refusing to take responsibility for the problem, as millions are spent on ineffective delayed discharges at an acute level.  We know from international work that it does not have to be like this.  Challenging and initiating change in respect of this issue is a win-win for everybody involved.  We hope the committee will give our request due consideration in proportion to the scale of the problem we face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen McMonagle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McMonagle and invite Ms Leonard to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#Q00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I am here to speak about one of the most stigmatised of all health issues.  It is important to state at the outset that no mother intends to cause harm to her child and that foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASDs, are not the result of an uncaring act.  There are complex reasons that women drink during pregnancy and I hope we will return to them later in the discussion.  Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability in the world.  More children are born every year with FASD than are born with autism spectrum disorder, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome combined.  FASDs are brain-based impairments resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.  Alcohol has been documented as a toxic teratogenic substance for more than 40 years.  It passes freely through the placenta during pregnancy and results in a range of learning and neurological disabilities, behavioural deficits, difficulties with regulation of mood and behaviour, cognitive deficits and impaired executive functioning.<\/p> <p>  As outlined on page 3 of our submission, people with FASD are at an increased risk of a range of difficulties across their lifespan.  More than half will serve jail sentences or be confined in drug treatment or psychiatric facilities as adults.  The prison experience for people with FASD must be understood within a context.  Many of them have difficulties with impulse control, an inability to learn from punishment and discipline and difficulty understanding and adhering to rules.  Some 92% of people with FASD will receive a secondary formal mental health diagnosis.  Although FASDs are permanent, diagnosis, early intervention and support have been proven to mitigate associated risks, including poor mental health, addiction and suicide.  Early diagnosis can help to identify other associated health conditions.  In fact, 428 co-occurring conditions have been identified across 127 studies of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, including epilepsy, heart defects, compromised auditory function and compromised immune system.<\/p> <p>  In an international review conducted last year, Ireland was featured as one of five countries with the highest prevalence of foetal alcohol syndrome, FAS.  The latter is at the most severe end of the FASD spectrum, with the greatest alcohol effects, including physical malformations.  It is estimated that 600 babies are born with FAS in Ireland each year and that 40,000 people are living with the condition.<\/p><p>The numbers of those affected by FASDs, ranging in nature from mild to severe, could be ten times that figure because international evidence indicates that for every case of FAS, there are at least ten cases of FASD.<\/p><p> We are delighted to be here in the context of a review of neurological supports and services in Ireland.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recommends action to deal with neurological disorders associated with the consumption of toxic compounds, including alcohol.  A number of recommendations to this committee are made and shown on page 4 of our submission.  The key recommendation is for clear clinical guidelines on the diagnosis of FASD to be developed and agreed.  The development and adoption of clear diagnostic criteria will assist clinicians in the assignment of more accurate diagnoses of FASD and pave the way to more widespread early intervention, improved prevention efforts and cost savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss neurorehabilitation services.  I am familiar with many members so I will not go into too much detail on the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI.  We are an umbrella organisation that supports over 120 disability organisations and works with many others.  We provide information, training, networking, advocacy and representation, research and policy development and organisational development.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking if we know who we are talking about when we refer to the disabled.  According to census 2016, 13.5% of the population, or 643,131 people, identify as having at least one disability.  One in four of those acquire a disability at working age, meaning that most of them are likely to be already in work, married or living in their own homes in their communities.  Once the onset of disability occurs, timely access to neurorehabilitation services will directly impact on a person's life and family so we fully endorse the NAI's call for greater investment in neurological and neurorehabilitation services.  However, DFI can only do half the job alone because most people with disabilities will continue to live in their own homes and communities.  They may have a short-term intervention in the form of acute services but they will return to their communities and, unless we invest in a solid community services programme that supports them and their families to live and navigate the world with their neurological condition, we will be putting money in false places.<\/p> <p>  We also need to ask what the disability spend is achieving.  We currently spend &euro;1.9 billion on disability, health and personal social services in Ireland.  In 2019, 85% of the HSE disability budget supports over 8,500 people through a range of residential supports and for 27,000 people in day places.  We are not questioning the need for these individuals to receive that support.  However, a small cohort of the disability population is soaking up a large amount of the disability spend.  These figures reinforce a report compiled as part of the value-for-money and policy review of disability services for the Department of Health.  Less than 10% of funding is directed towards community services programmes such as personal assistants, respite, day services and other services, areas where the neurorehabilitation services are involved.<\/p> <p>  Community services and supports are mostly co-funded by a range of disability organisations.  Ms Battles will give members a good sense of what that means.  Many of these are condition-specific and help individuals and families to navigate the diagnosis and develop strategies for self-management and for access to a range of services such as acute and primary care services, housing services, social welfare services and local education and training services which they need to retrain or reskill to enable them to return to work.  We fully support the call for acute neurorehabilitation services but we also call for a better understanding of, and investment in, a range of specific community services.<\/p><p>They include home supports, family supports and health and well-being services which Ms Battles will go through further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland was established in 1961.  In the 58 years since its foundation its mission has evolved to support people with multiple sclerosis, MS, in the rapidly changing therapeutic, social, political and economic environment.  It is the only national organisation that provides information, support and advocacy services for the MS community.  Our mission is to enable and empower people affected by MS to live the life of their choice to their full potential.<br\/><br\/>We receive 52% of our funding from the State and 48% through fundraising initiatives.  We are very cognisant of the lack of neurorehabilitation services available to people with MS and a wide range of other neurological conditions.  We are also very aware that MS and other progressive neurological conditions can have both physical and psychological consequences which may have an enormous long-term impact on almost every aspect of the daily lives of those affected.  Being aware of this and obviously everything Ms Rogers and Dr. McCarthy said, we believe that, as a voluntary organisation, we have a variety of creative and dynamic ways to mitigate the deficits mentioned.  I would like to take the joint committee through two or three of them.<br\/><br\/>One is our exercise related activity programmes that are run in the community.  As Dr. McCarthy said, most people come back out and live in their community after their diagnosis.  When we won &quot;Tesco charity of the year&quot; a number of years ago, the money was put into a research project with the University of Limerick's physiotherapy department.  The results of the research clearly demonstrated that, to effect change in an MS population, physical activity needed to be delivered with frequency and intensity to maintain the change.  The results also showed that when people stopped, they returned to a baseline, or often worsened.  We know from the research that a person with MS will probably, if he or she is lucky to receive it because it is provided on an <i>ad hoc <\/i>basis, receive one hour's worth of physiotherapy from the State in his or her local community.  That is if he or she can get out of his or her home and travel to the physiotherapy class, or even get into it because a lot of the places in which classes are being run are not accessible.  We know that we have an issue in that regard.<br\/><br\/>We provide around &euro;200,000 of fundraised income a year for the provision and delivery of physiotherapy and exercise-related programmes.  In 2018, 1,802 people accessed the programmes in the Twenty-six Counties.  The delivery of the programmes is supported by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Therefore, what we have are community employment programmes, as part of which we have people participating in a back-to-work programme training to become physiotherapy assistants.  The physiotherapist makes the assessment of a person in the community and the trained physiotherapy assistants will go out to him or her on a weekly basis for the physiotherapy class.  It is someone who may not be able to get out of his or her house because he or she does not have transport from his or her rural location into the community or he or she may feel he or she is not able to do so because of fatigue.  Our physiotherapy assistants will go to the house and we know from the research that it is not only the actual physical activity that improves a person's mental and physical health but also the interaction with others and the social engagement with them.  The physiotherapy programmes came from the initial research programme and are being delivered throughout the country.  We have continued the relationship with the University of Limerick and developed two new evidence-based programmes with the focus on prevention.  They are being run with funding we have received where funding is restricted to research initiatives.  <br\/><br\/>The first programme about which I would like to tell the committee is Step it Up.  It is a physiotherapy-led exercise and education programme designed to improve symptoms through knowledge, exercise participation and coaching.  It has primarily been designed for people who are inactive, have minimal walking problems and been relatively recently diagnosed with the condition.  Its central aim is to encourage participants to address and plan for their physical activity needs.  Let us put it into reality.  Let us take someone called Mary, a 24 year old female nurse.  She has received a diagnosis of MS and is struggling to maintain her daily activity levels in her work.  As she is finding it really difficult, she comes to our community worker for an assessment.  The reality for her is that she is just about able to work during the week and when she comes home in the evening, she has to go to bed.  She is exhausted and needs the weekend to recover.  She is referred to one of our Step it Up programmes.<\/p><p>Based on a 12-week programme, she is now running with her dog and, as of last week, she was running up a hill.  This is real.  We can spout statistics all we want but I wanted to try to make it real for members.  Mary is a person who is now no longer concerned about not being able to work and she is no longer considering retiring at 27.  She is actively participating in and contributing to society and paying her taxes and she now has better quality of life.<\/p><p> The other programme, Better Balance, is a physiotherapy-led exercise and education programme designed to improve balance and reduce falls.  It is suited to those who have recently experienced a fall or who are afraid of falling.  It does not apply only to people with MS but it is obviously related.  Its central aim is to encourage the self-reflection of participants in their daily lives to avoid falls.  A 44 year old female who has retired from her employment due to multiple sclerosis had fallen three times in a two-year period and had three fractures.  She has not fallen in the past 12 weeks and is now going back out and socialising.  One must look at it from her point of view, that is, the point of view of someone who is 44 and retired.  These programmes are enabling her to participate in her community and increasing her quality of life.<\/p><p> We have taken all the research I have mentioned in respect of the two programmes and turned it into an Activity Matters programme, which is available on a website.  One can avail of it in one&rsquo;s own home, as long as one has an Internet connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ava Battles","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Moving swiftly along.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#T00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>It enables participants to be more active and participate in their community.

We have a 12-bed respite facility that operates in Dublin.  People come to it from all over the country.  It is not only a place where a person can get an MS NCT but it also presents an opportunity for carers who are looking after individuals with MS daily to get a break while the latter stay with us for five, seven or 12 nights.<\/p> <p>  With regard to working collaboratively with other organisations, we work with RehabCare in the west.  Unfortunately, it is only in the west.  The HSE provides funding to RehabCare for people with cognitive rehabilitation needs.  They come to us and meet our community worker and we identify their cognitive issues.  They are then referred to the RehabCare cognitive programme and receive an assessment.  They engage in a 12-week programme.

We are reminding them that there more than 600,000 people with disabilities depend on these types of services, not on residential services or day services.  One in four of us today will probably end up depending on these types of services.

It is not specific to Ireland, rather it seems to be the case internationally.  It is only in the last ten years that research in this area has spiked, given the increased number of people coming through with the condition.  We know from a recent research paper published by the Care Services Improvement Partnership in the United Kingdom that there is a lack of diagnostic expertise and training to diagnose an alcohol-related brain injury among core professional groups.  The paper also set out that professionals often stigmatised patients and failed to see an underlying brain injury because they believed challenging behaviours or individual difficulties were due to individuals' alcohol use.  Professionals failed to recognise that it might be the result of a brain injury and to question whether something other than alcohol use might be going on with someone.  The consistent absence of resources in this area in Ireland does not incentivise professionals to identify the condition.  If it is identified, what does the professional do with the person who has it?  There is a great deal we could do to increase the identification rate and adopt best practice in the management of this condition.  We need to build expertise in the recognition and management of this group not only in addiction services but also in acute services.  There should be routine screening of cognition and malnutrition among long-term heavy users of alcohol.  That would help greatly to improve identification rates.  It should be spurred on by the fact that the prognosis for the condition is very good if identified early enough.

A person needs an early diagnosis and that is vital.  However, I reiterate that such a person will go back into the community and will need the multidisciplinary approach which includes occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and neuropsychologists.  Neurologists were like hen's teeth when I started working in the sector and now we have 34.  That is great but it is ridiculous that somebody might wait a year to get a diagnosis.  There is much that can happen to somebody's underlying condition in a year.<\/p> <p>  I will reference the issue about access to medicines.  I will not speak specifically about Spinraza but I want to reference the issue of access to medicines.  We believe that people should have access to the right treatment at the right time.  There is a body of international evidence to show that people should be diagnosed early and treated appropriately.  In Ireland, we have an issue with access to new medications.  Someone who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, MS, 20 years ago would have been sent home, told to rest and given nothing.  Thankfully, neurologists now have a suite of 15 or 16 disease-modifying therapies at their disposal but new medications are coming on-stream all the time.  The difficulty is that people cannot access them because they are not getting through the current system.  I reiterate what Ms Rogers said earlier about the Medical Research Charities Group and the Irish Platform for Patients Organisations, Science and Industry stressing that we need to look at how that system is currently not working and how people get access to it.  The important thing is to keep people well, participating and contributing to society because the more we do that, the better it is for everybody.

I refer to foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and the issue of information.  I spoke recently to a front-line worker in the health service who had been dealing for three months with a pregnant patient diagnosed as having cocaine her system.  We are not only talking about alcohol only but a combination of alcohol and drugs.  A figure of 600 cases annually was given.  Are figures available from hospitals to show if the problem is greater in particular areas?  Is enough being done to get information out about consuming alcohol during pregnancy?  Abuse of alcohol is a major issue.  As we speak, approximately 2,000 of those occupying hospital beds for reasons directly related to excessive consumption of alcohol.  Is enough being done to educate people on this issue or is a more intense campaign needed?<\/p> <p>  On individual hospitals, some years ago, at least ten babies in the care of the Rotunda Hospital on any one day were suffering from withdrawal symptoms following birth.  Has that figure increased in real terms in the past ten years?  Such an increase would mean that our information systems are not working at a local or national level.  What must be done to highlight the risks associated with the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy?  How can that be factor into healthcare information programmes?  Can more be done in this regard?  Has any similar programme been shown to work in other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#Y00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>On other programmes that have been shown to work, there is an acceptance at a global level that prevention on its own is not adequate to address issues in relation to foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  It is necessary to have a long-term strategy for the provision of supports, services and diagnostics to families who are impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure.  That said, there is a role for prevention and many forward steps have been taken in that area.  Levels of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder in a population are linked to population level consumption.  On the positive side, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act has been introduced and the HSE has established a clinical working group on foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and appointed a clinical lead.  This group and the lead specialist have clearly marked out that the areas they will cover are prevention, education and population level messages.  That is very welcome and the DFI is happy it is happening.  In addition, through the Department of Health, an additional seven drug liaison midwives will be appointed under the national drugs strategy to work with women who have issues with alcohol addiction and support them in moving towards alcohol-free pregnancies.<\/p> <p>  While much has been done in this area, we have not yet reached a point where the policy and medical areas have one clear message.  At an international level, the World Health Organization says that no amount of alcohol intake during pregnancy can be considered safe, there is no safe trimester in which one might drink alcohol, all forms of alcohol pose a similar risk and binge drinking poses a dose-related risk.  We should all be concerned that binge drinking is very much the signifier of how people in this country drink.<\/p><p>Population level consumption was going down over a number of years but binge drinking continued to be the norm.<\/p><p> While we would welcome all of the developments I have mentioned, it is important that we do not just view this in the narrow space of prevention.  There will always be women who continue to drink during pregnancy.  The European Birth Mother Network is a group of mothers with children who have been impacted by foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASDs.  The network is clear that there is a complex mix of reasons for women drinking during pregnancy, for example, childhood trauma, addiction and knowing people who drank during pregnancy and whose children were okay.  Not every alcohol exposed pregnancy will result in a child with an FASD.  These are important messages.  Another reason for prevention alone being a major challenge is that women may often not know that they are pregnant until they are five, six, seven or eight weeks into their pregnancies and the foetus may be exposed to alcohol during that period.<\/p><p> There are a range of reasons that we must approach this issue in a no stigma, no shame and no blame way and we must understand that it is complex.  We need prevention and a clear message from our medical community but we will also need supports and services, which can only follow on from diagnostics.  That is why we are asking committee members to use whatever access and influence they have to support the call for the development of clear diagnostic criteria for foetal alcohol syndrome, FAS, and FASD.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Another complex issue is the combination of alcohol and drugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#Z00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Leonard"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Are there figures on how that issue has changed in, for example, the past 15 years?

Their evidence challenges us in a number of ways.  I look forward to reading the transcript.  We may need to re-examine the issue.  Much has been raised at this meeting that we cannot get into in this session alone - prevention, different service mixes, who provides what, impacts on lives, etc.  I will leave that there, though.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Dr. McCarthy's presentation.  She stated that 85% of the &euro;1.9 billion for disability services was expended on residential day services and respite.  Those types of services go back to old God's time when we did not have diagnostics, we tried to put people in caring places and we did not have much else going on.  I would be interested in short responses to my question.  Do we have the wrong ratios in disability services funding?  While I am not suggesting that the services and supports receiving the 85% of funding are not needed, only 15% is being spent on supports that are located in the community even though it was pointed out that many people return to and try to survive in their communities.  This is particularly the case for the cohort we are discussing today, namely, people with neurological conditions.<\/p><p>How might Sl&aacute;intecare be part of the proposed solutions?  Is it lacking in this regard or does it have potential?<\/p><p> I thank Ms Roger's for her presentation on behalf of the NAI.  The national policy and strategy for neurological services was published in 2011 but the implementation plan relating to it was only published in February.  What has been the loss of progress in those eight years of not having an implementation plan?  Such a plan will never provide the billions required to address all of the issues but, in my view, producing strategies without timely implementation plans for the same year is wrong.  A strategy or policy without an implementation plan is akin to providing pain relief.  It is a three-card trick.<\/p><p> The impact of medicines was mentioned.  One of our guests stated that, dating back over 20 years or so, there was not a lot in terms of medicines to give to people.  I know from meeting people who suffer with MS that the lack of medicine in the early 80s made life pretty grim for them, which impacted greatly on their families.  The same applies in regard to other neurological conditions.  How has the development of medicines that can modify conditions impacted on people's daily lives and what is needed to further increase that impact?<\/p><p> I welcome the presentations on ARBI and FASD.  Dr. McGonagle mentioned that identification of ARBI is poor and referenced data relating to Letterkenny, Sligo and Cavan.  We hear a lot about continued waste in the health services.  I am not too sure that when they speak about such waste, people are referring to the effects of misdiagnosis.  Rather, they are speaking about items being thrown out or not used properly.<\/p><p> The recommendations put forward in the presentations are interesting in that they are not financial asks but calls for inquiries into what is being done for the thousands of people who suffer with conditions from which they are many knock-on effects, including for their families.  The recommendations are a plea to us, as a committee, to do what we can to improve services in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#Z00600","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I am always really conscious that in providing data one is splitting a sector into those who have and those who have not.  That is not the intention.<\/p><p>I needed people to see the starkness of the inequity in accessing disability services in Ireland.<\/p><p> There was a question about whether we had the wrong models of support.  Without a doubt, this would have been mentioned in our policy review in the context of value for money.  Looking at what is expected of us under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, of course, we have the wrong mix of services.  People with disabilities and their families should be confident that they can receive services as close as possible to their local community.  This resonates with what we are talking about with respect to neurorehabilitation services.  The services should be as individual as possible.  It is no surprise that there has been no real increase in personal assistant and respite care services; such services facilitate a person in living in the community.<\/p><p> There is also the issue arising from the lack of demographic evidence to support the case for transitioning to a new model of service.  That is what is being attempted in decongregation and supporting new models of day services.  The evidence is available and people know the data and what they are talking about.  It can be planned.  It is very hard to speak about a new model of service with community services infrastructure when there is no demographic evidence to show what the need will be time and again to support the planning process.  That is required to give confidence to the planners and those who will deliver the service, as well as those who will depend on it.<\/p><p> The member is correct that we could rewrite a service model for people with disabilities as it is not fit for purpose.  People need to live at home or independently, or at least as close to communities as possible.  The process must be person-centred and there should be a mix or range of personally driven services such as personal assistants and home supports.  We also spoke about episodic health interventions that were required.  The process needs to move beyond health, as it is only the enabler.  Health services should be available to enable people to access services provided by other Departments and agencies.  Education services should be delivered through the education and training boards, for example, and there should be support to deliver them in a mainstream way as much as possible.  Social welfare and housing services are all mainstream services, but we need a health service that has resources and provides supports such as personal assistant hours that are fit for purpose and which can support people in accessing mainstream services.  We need to reinvent our understanding of the role of health bodies and look more at the personal social services side of health services in order to invest in them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Senator Dolan asked whether we had got the ratio wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#BB00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I also mentioned Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#BB00300","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I have dealt with that issue.  Sl&aacute;intecare is very silent on disability services.  It speaks to the new neurorehabilitation strategy, but otherwise it is very silent on disability services, although there may be one or two references to them.  We are looking for an interface.  People with disabilities are heavy users of the health system.  They are the people who are presenting with neurological issues and availing of acute services.  They are people with acquired brain injury and in relapse.  They are heavy users of core health systems.  They are also using neurorehabilitation services through primary care services and access personal assistants and home supports.  They draw across the health system, but they are dealt with individually through each siloed part of the HSE.  Sl&aacute;intecare looks for joined-up services and we want to have them \"disability-proofed\".  How can we enable these models of service?  Ms Battles could probably give a better example, but the majority of services could be delivered within a much softer community-based infrastructure such as the resources and supports for self-management provided at community level.  There are times, with a peak in the condition, when access to primary care services is required, but there are also times, especially at the time of diagnosis, when more acute services have a role to play in intervention.  Equally, it is critical to have fluidity in step-down services.  Sometimes there is silence in Sl&aacute;intecare in understanding the population and how it uses the health service.

From my perspective, the loss has been the increase in the level of disability because people have not had access to services.  It has meant a decrease in their quality of life and resulted in young people living in nursing homes.  My colleague referred to silos in the HSE in not having conversations with each other.  One budget will not result in a person being given a home care package, but we will put a 42 year old man with three children into a nursing home to provide him with care for the rest of his life.  It is about having seamless services that put the person at the centre of service delivery and developing services around the person to meet his or her needs to stay well and in the community.  That brings us back to Sl&aacute;intecare's ethos.  The lack of progress has been huge for us and everybody involved.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the impact of medicines.  When medicines are being discussed, one often finds that the only ones that will be mentioned on radio are the ones that will give a person another few days or weeks of life.  There are very few discussions about how medicines improve a person's quality of life.  If one asks people with MS - I can only speak about this specifically - they say the fact that there are new medicines brings huge hope.  That is what people need; they need access to medicines that will keep them well.  If I was to say to all of the committee members present that they would not make it to the bathroom, we would all be very embarrassed.  It is something we take for granted because we can just get up and walk out to go to the bathroom.  For some people, however, a new medication can make all the difference and enable them to make it to the bathroom.  It means that they are no longer afraid to leave the house.  They can socialise and work.  It goes back to the points made about people making a contribution to society and having a better quality of life.  I would broaden it from access to medicines to access to all treatments across the board as being vitally important.  Sl&aacute;intecare looks at it from the point of view of keeping people well and the self-management piece in the community, but we need to put resources behind it.  There is no point in producing a lovely report and then leaving it on the shelf because it will not benefit anybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ava Battles"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I come at Senator Dolan's observations from a slightly different angle.  With alcohol related brain injury and foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASD, we can demonstrate from the evidence that by providing for early intervention and supports for families affected by the conditions there are huge potential cost savings to the State.  Canada is considered to be one of the global leaders when it comes to prevention, treatment and support in dealing with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  The Canadian Federal Government has estimated that it costs taxpayers the equivalent of &euro;1.2 million extra - Canadian $1.75 million - for every person who is born prenatally alcohol exposed, but that huge cost savings can be made through early intervention, diagnosis and support services across a person's life span.  Reference was made to waste in the health system.  Wasted resources in dealing with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders span the range of systems, including, for example, trying to address the issue of drop-outs in the education system and the cost to the justice system of somebody being incarcerated and jailed simply because they did not receive the right support or advocacy services within the system.  It is in terms of social and health supports such as not diagnosing or understanding the conditions and comorbidities.<\/p><p>The Senator is correct that our asks are related to our approach, understanding and acceptance that these are significant public health issues.<\/p><p> Our policy position on the development of diagnostics is informed by the families impacted on by foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  Two years ago we supported families to form an alliance to end the neurological developmental disorder prenatal alcohol exposure, PAE.  When I asked those families about their one ask at today&rsquo;s proceedings, they all stated it was about looking for clear diagnostic guidelines.  They point out that nothing can happen until we at least understand what is happening with children.  They can then become advocates for the provision of transitional places in schools and so forth.

We hear about various conditions and how matters have progressed to the extent that it is not possible to deal with them in the way that it is sought to deal with them.

I had another engagement.  I will briefly touch on the valproate issue.  I am a pharmacist by profession and have been dispensing valproate for years.  We talk about awareness of the side effects and when they happened and so on.  In terms of where we go from here, women with epilepsy who want to have a baby have an additional requirement for folic acid.  It is all very well complaining about the past - as a pharmacist, I understand people's issues - but the focus should surely be on proper folic acid supplementation to mitigate against any of the side effects of medications that women often must take to keep them seizure free and maintain their pregnancies.<\/p><p>Folic acid is something I feel particularly strongly about, not only in relation to neurological conditions.  There is additional need for higher strength folic acid.  It depends on weight but I understand the current practice is 5 mg, 20 times the dose.  That is not commonly known.  That message must be delivered through GPs and community pharmacists because when it comes to access the community pharmacist generally knows first when someone is pregnant because pharmacists sell the pregnancy test.  I have done some work with my party on having folic acid placed beside pregnancy tests.  I have also done the sums on the cost of providing folic acid free of charge and have looked at what is done in other countries.  There are some things that we cannot change now but we can protect population health in the future with proper folic acid supplementation.  If anyone here is doing work on this, I ask that he or she address the issue. <br\/><br\/>One of the witnesses spoke about access to medication.  I agree that the focus of the system is on quality-adjusted life years, QALYs, which determine whether one takes X, Y or Z tablet.  When Orkambi was being approved it was widely noted that it was not only an issue of curing a condition or living longer but also what the increase in lung function could mean for somebody.  That discussion has started and it is not as cold and clinical as it used to be.  There is a way to go on this but the message should go out that whereas Orkambi did not go through the system or tick the boxes, a dispensation was made because of the particularly high rate of cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  Advocates put their names out publicly and showed what the small increase in lung function gave them in terms of quality of life.  <br\/><br\/>It may have been discussed before I arrived but there is an issue with rapid neurological disorders such as motor neurone disease and some of the rapid cycling types of MS, for which home care packages kick in at 65 years.  Motor neurone disease is often a younger person's condition affecting some patients in their mid-40s.  It does not matter what a person's means are or if he or she is a billionaire.  People with a condition such as motor neurone disease require a medical card because they require access to services.  The witnesses know this.  It is very concerning that individuals, including some who do not have family members, who are faced with the burden of this very frightening condition and a bundle of paperwork may be told that they cannot access services because they are below 65 years and have a condition that is sometimes associated with older people.  Have any of the witnesses or the organisations they represent done any work we could present to the Minister for Health showing how we could make it easier for people in such desperate circumstances to access services, home care packages and the grants they require to convert their homes as their condition progresses.  Many people who have rapid progressing conditions want to live in their own homes.  Sadly, I have often dealt with people who have died before they have had the appropriate adaptations made to their homes.  I would be interested to hear of any work on this or any proposals the organisations may have put to the Minister on it as it may be something that could be easily fixed.  No doctor will sign off on something that says a patient has a rapid progressing neurological disorder unless the patient has it.  I cannot see why GPs must certify and there is so much rigmarole when a definitive diagnosis has been made of a serious neurological disorder.<br\/><br\/>I sit on the Committee of Public Accounts.  Recently the Environmental Protection Agency was before the committee on water quality.  I referred to a <i>National Geographic <\/i>report on the high level of drugs, illicit and otherwise, found in the water supply in some cities.<\/p><p>Last week it was reported that all the shrimp in Suffolk - I do not know if anyone else has read about the shrimp in Suffolk - have tested positive for cocaine.  By the looks of things, the excretion of illicit substances into our water supply is becoming a huge issue.  We talk here about people taking alcohol and other drugs consciously in pregnancy, but are the witnesses aware of any work or studies on increases in neurological disorders or conditions among neonates in this regard?  Is there any link between this and water quality?  Is any of the witnesses' organisations undertaking a body of work in this regard?  I have been waiting for three weeks for a reply from the EPA regarding the work it is doing on this.  Perhaps someone within the witnesses' fields is doing work on the very clear carcinogenic, teratogenic and neurotoxic effects of illicit substances, or perhaps it is only me thinking about these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019050800002#EE00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy O'Connell's comment on folic acid, and this goes back to the comment we made in response to Deputy Durkan about the voluntary organisations taking up the mantle on this, I am aware that one of our members, Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland, has been doing work on promoting the use of folic acid, for obvious reasons.

From our point of view, as an organisation representing those affected by MS, we could talk about the importance of taking vitamin D, for example.  Again, though, we are trying to provide a range of services, we are fundraising to provide those services and then there needs to be an awareness campaign.  There is the difficulty as to who will provide the funding for the awareness campaign the Deputy speaks about and how we resource getting the GPs and the pharmacists to take on board what we say.  Now one has to pay an external company to get one's leaflet into a GP surgery.

They are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee; however if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the Salient Rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I invite Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#K00200","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving us the opportunity to meet them.  I am joined by my fellow commissioners Mr. Kieran FitzGerald and Mr. Patrick Sullivan.  Since we last met the joint committee, Mr. Sullivan joined GSOC last July after a Public Appointments Service open competition.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of the commission were last before the committee on 28 February 2018.  On that date the commission updated the committee on the fact that there had been no statutory changes since we had last met it in September 2016, but we were aware of the work being undertaken by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which had been established in the interim period in May 2017.  In February 2018 we also provided the committee with the business case we had submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In it we sought an increase in our staff numbers to assist in the development of our usual caseload and the provision of a separate protected disclosures unit.  As members will have seen in the larger submission we provided for the committee, the business case was met in full.  To date, we have taken on 21 of the 42 sanctioned staff, with the remaining staff to be with us in the coming months.  For the first time in its history, GSOC's number of staff is in excess of 100.  As of 30 April this year, 115 people were working in GSOC.<\/p> <p>  The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was published on 18 September last year.  The recommendations in respect of a complaints oversight body were in keeping with the submissions made by GSOC to the commission.  GSOC welcomed the proposals, in particular the recommendation made on page 49 of the report that \"all complaints about the police should be routed through IOPO [the tentative name for the new body] to determine what action needs to be taken\".  At a briefing meeting that morning with Ms Kathleen O'Toole, the commission chair, she confirmed that \"all complaints\" meant from whatever source and that the Garda should not be investigating itself.  It is important to note at this juncture that in our fuller submission we see the word \"complaint\" as meaning any allegation, from whatever source, internal or external to the Garda, including from confidential human informants or other police agencies, indicating criminal activity or serious misconduct by a member or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  We have included in our submission the \"police oversight principles\" which were adopted in November 2011 by the European Partners Against Corruption, EPAC.  Key among them are that the police oversight body be sufficiently separated from the hierarchy of the police, subject to its remit, and that the police oversight body be governed and controlled by persons who are not current serving police officers.  These are fundamental oversight principles adopted by the European organisation mentioned.  They are in keeping with the proposals made in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which has been endorsed by the Government.<\/p> <p>  GSOC recently made a submission to the review group on anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures which is chaired by the former Director of Public Prosecutions Mr. James Hamilton as part of that group's public consultation process.  GSOC reiterated the importance of independent oversight where allegations of corruption by Garda members were concerned.  We have had one meeting with the Department of Justice and Equality about the proposed new legislation and made further written submissions to it.<\/p><p>However, as of yet we have not seen any draft for the new complaints oversight body.<br\/><br\/>GSOC, with the other oversight bodies, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority, did raise concerns when we became aware that there was no oversight element in the implementation body set up to steer through the various recommendations made in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Of particular concern to GSOC is the issue of matching a new remit with resources.  In 2018, under the current legislative provisions, in excess of 500 cases were referred back from GSOC to the Garda for investigation.  There will have to be some increase in resources for GSOC to deal with this caseload.  It must also be noted that the Garda superintendents and inspectors who deal with these cases are spread throughout the country.  Consideration will also have to be given to the geographic challenges.  It must be remembered that there is a cost to the State under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Garda&iacute; are diverted from their usual policing duties to carry out these GSOC investigations and this has an effect in terms of their time and the resulting Garda costs.  GSOC is conscious that if a new complaints oversight body is to succeed, these are issues that should be dealt with in advance of the new organisation being set up.  The concern is that without proper planning, resulting in a delay, erosion of public trust in the new body will set in at an early stage.<br\/><br\/>GSOC is preparing a new business plan drawing on its experience and information to assist in predicting the type of organisation that will be required to meet the demands of a new legislative framework.  We hope to have it completed by the middle of 2019, particularly having regard to the proposed date of 1 January 2021 for when a new legislative structure will commence.<br\/><br\/>An area of significance in the work of GSOC and of any new body is access to information.  A key principle in the European Partners Against Corruption, EPAC, police oversight principles is that &quot;The police oversight body's investigators must be provided with the full range of police powers to enable them to conduct fair, independent and effective investigations, in particular the power to obtain all the information necessary to conduct an effective investigation&quot;.  As I indicated, the principles were delivered in 2011.  They are in keeping with the recently adopted Venice Principles, the Principles on the Protection and Promotion of the Ombudsman Institution, adopted in Strasbourg on 15 and 16 March by the Venice Commission, the European Commission for Democracy through Law and the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters.<br\/><br\/>We have noted in our submission to the committee that paragraph 16 of the principles adopted in March reads:<\/p><blockquote>The Ombudsman shall be entitled to request the co-operation of any individuals or organisations who may be able to assist in his or her investigations.  The Ombudsman shall have a legally enforceable right to unrestricted access to all relevant documents, databases and materials, including those which might otherwise be legally privileged or confidential.<\/blockquote><p>We have submitted the principles to the Department of Justice and Equality, to which the new legislation should have regard when dealing with the necessary powers required for fair and proportionate independent investigations.<\/p><p>Access to information in the Garda is a matter we raised at our first meeting with the committee in September 2016, at which we highlighted the provisions of section 66 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, which includes a statutory requirement on the Chief Constable, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing Board to provide documentation and information for the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> GSOC has noted in its submission to the committee that, with the public, we have become aware through the media of allegations of Garda wrongdoing.  We are aware that the Garda continues to conduct criminal investigations of its own members without the knowledge or participation of GSOC.  We find this troubling.  This practice runs the risk of allegations of cover-up, bias or corruption when it becomes known that such investigations have been carried out internally.  It runs the risk that fair and independent investigations are not seen as such by the public because they were not notified outside the organisation.  Most importantly, it runs the risk of undermining public trust significantly if such internal investigations go wrong.  The practice also flies in the face of the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland that all such matters be routed through GSOC or the new oversight organisation.<\/p><p> In our 2016 submission to the committee we highlighted as a priority the need to establish more efficient processes to deal with service issues.  We have included in our submission today the work that commenced in February 2018 between GSOC and the Garda on the local intervention initiative.  Committee members will see the spread of the initiative throughout the country, with certain exceptions.  GSOC has paid tribute to the work done by our former staff member Ms Pamela Howard and Inspector Greg Mekitarian of Pearse Street Garda station in Dublin in promoting and developing the pilot scheme.  It is an example of the two organisations co-operatively and collaboratively using their joint experiences to provide the public with a better police service.  GSOC and the Garda see this as an important process for the future.  To that end, we will continue to review numbers and satisfaction levels in this area.  It meets the needs of the people concerned, both garda&iacute; and the public, to sort out issues without resorting to formal disciplinary investigations.<\/p><p> An issue of great concern to all in the past few years has been the handling of protected disclosures within the Garda organisation.  GSOC sought and obtained an increase in its numbers for these important investigations.  We have set up a separate unit with separate facilities.  The last of the sanctioned investigators joined the unit in the past week.  As we have reported, GSOC received 24 new protected disclosures from garda&iacute; in 2018 and they have continued into 2019.  GSOC is of the view that the continued growth in the number of protected disclosures made to it indicates one of two things &ndash; growing confidence in GSOC to treat the disclosures respectfully or a lack of confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate such disclosures.  We have noted in our submission the contrast as far back as 2017 in the numbers officially reported by the Garda.  In that year there were 11 protected disclosures made to the Garda internally, while the number of protected disclosures made to GSOC in the same year was 22, double the Garda number.  It seems, as new legislation for both organisations is being planned, that the issue of how protected disclosures are dealt with in the two organisations could be usefully reviewed to provide for Garda staff the best and most efficient way of dealing with the issues that have arisen through the disclosures made during the years.<\/p><p>I have provided, belatedly this morning, a diagram workflow which provides a representation of how the current legislation directs us to deal with complaints.  As will be noted, it is a maze in terms of what is required.  We hope to have produced a better diagram by the next time we appear before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Justice Ring for her opening statement and the difficult to follow diagram.

It is great that we are discussing this subject again but I get a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>.  These issues have been talked about more since the commission last appeared before the committee but in terms of structural changes, particularly legislatively, we are no further along the road.  That is my view.<\/p><p>My first batch of questions relate to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the work of GSOC.  The press statement issued by GSOC on publication of that report correctly, as far as I am concerned, pinpointed that a lot of what is said therein echoed what had been already said by GSOC.  In other words, there is nothing new in it.  This could have been legislatively provided for before now.  I am incredibly frustrated about that.  Does GSOC expect to get a statutory right to information, in particular?  As highlighted, this is an area that has been long lobbied for, including in the 2016 report of this committee.  Is GSOC any closer to getting that statutory right to information?  <\/p><p>I was concerned to hear in the opening statement that GSOC found out about the implementation group and that the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority have also been excluded from the implementation group around the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  That is news to me, which I do not welcome.  I note that when GSOC raised the matter with the Department, the response was that it will consult with GSOC.  I do not think that is adequate.  Do the witnesses still believe that GSOC should have a seat at the table?  I believe it should, and that this committee should do all it can to assist in that regard.  <\/p><p>It was also mentioned that the GSOC business plan should be available by the middle of this year.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on what that means and on the point regarding what additional resources are required.  It is a bit unfair to ask the witnesses to comment on the overlap with the Commission on the Future of Policing but an interpretation of it could be that we could have a lot of what is proposed in place and been well down the road already if we had not had the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  There is no reason much of what is proposed is being delayed.  I would welcome the witnesses' responses to those questions before I move to my next batch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#O00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Mr. Fitzgerald will respond to the question on the statutory right to information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>With regard to the statutory right to information, we are advised that the Department of Justice and Equality is currently preparing the draft heads of Bill for the new legislation.

There is a significant number of cross-departmental representatives and, unsurprisingly, the membership includes the Garda Commissioner.  As the legislation is also going to deal with new structures in terms of oversight, I cannot help the committee in saying why it was not thought that there should be some representation from the current oversight bodies.  We have had one meeting with the implementation personnel but they continue their work at their rate.  Beyond that I am afraid the committee would have to direct questions to them.  They have a very ambitious timetable under the supervision of the Department of the Taoiseach and it appears they are anxious to meet a start date for change of 1 January 2021.

I do not want to put the witnesses in the difficult position of having to comment on what the Department is doing but this is a forum to put on the public record some of the issues or to tease out what is going on behind the scenes.  Hand on heart and on the basis of what has been said and the information provided, I am very worried about where this is going.  The witnesses were before us three years ago and legislation had been drafted at the time.  Deputy Wallace had drafted legislation that would have given us what all of us said we needed.  It could have been in place by now but the witnesses have not seen any paperwork at all with respect to the draft heads of Bill in this respect.  They have no idea what aspects are included.  They have put on the public record that the body looking at implementation is heavy on civil servants and garda&iacute; but there is zero involvement from the oversight bodies.  That is scary and unhelpful from the Department's perspective.  It is not really a question but the witnesses have provided that information and it is an appalling, although not really a surprising, spectre.<\/p> <p>  I ask about the current scenario with respect to the handling of protected disclosures.  It is clearly a growing area in which the witnesses have been involved.  What is the average timescale being looked at for GSOC to assess and come to a conclusion with a protected disclosure?  I know they can be broad in range but what is the rough timeline?  What kind of co-operation is being received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Has it improved in the past year or two or has there been a noticeable difference?  There was mention in the statement of how GSOC has opened investigations despite garda&iacute; not informing the commission about incidents.  The commission happens to hear about these in the media, etc.  These include matters such as the temporary loss of a firearm and ammunition and so on.  I am trying to get my head around how that would happen.  I assume the commission would ask the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na afterwards why it was not informed directly about such matters.  What answer was given, assuming that question was asked?  Is there anything that could be done to sanction that?  It demonstrates a gap in accountability that is really ridiculous.<\/p><p>It would be helpful if there was more information on the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#P00300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>On the slightly separate issue of protected disclosures, we now have a full complement of investigators which has clearly assisted in dealing with matters that have been pending, and new matters.  The rate at which we have been contacted by garda&iacute; from all around the country is increasing and that puts demands on personnel just visiting with people.  We have an initial process in place that assesses the information given to us.  Regarding what may be to the person making the disclosure a protected disclosure, we first have to establish what is the basis for saying that and then we have to look at it from a legal point of view.  We have found for many people it is a very distressing experience.  They have had significant long-term experiences where, for instance, something like bullying has affected their work life and personal life so, in fact, the taking of a statement has had to be done over the course of days as opposed to a one hour session, for instance.  These cases are, even from an early stage, quite complex and they can be very difficult for the people making the disclosures.<\/p> <p>  We have levels of communication, having regard to the protections under the Act, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those are working well enough.  Our difficulty in any case whether it is a protected disclosure or not is knowing whether we have all of the relevant information.  We may ask for A, B and C and get A, B and C in a reasonable period but it is only when examining A, B and C that we discover D, E and F are relevant so we have to go back and make an application for those pieces of information.  We can get what we ask for but we do not always get what is relevant.  At the end of the day we have to accept that we have gotten everything.  I think I set out in my submission an example of a historical matter going back to the early 1980s where on initial application we were told, perhaps not surprisingly, that they could not find documentation.  We went to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and, perhaps not surprisingly, they could find the documentation.  Then at a late stage we were told by the person involved that they had, in recent times, made an application under data access and got documentation and we discovered that, indeed, in the data access office was information whereas the official request came back with the answer that there was no documentation.  I am not suggesting there was malfeasance on anyone's part but it was clear that a line of inquiry was followed, it revealed nothing so the answer back to us was that there was no documentation yet sitting in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were indeed documents.  We do not know sometimes when we are told we have everything or there is nothing more whether in fact we have everything or there is nothing more, and there is no sanction in that regard.  It is an ongoing issue and it may be that something like this will always exist.  Short of going in ourselves and going through every press and every file, we may not get everything.  One would hope that if better file keeping, computerisation and better protection of documentation occurs within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we will then get everything.<\/p><p>In terms of contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on investigations, we have picked up a newspaper and read of a matter or heard about it on \"Morning Ireland\", having been, like members of the public, unaware of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Did GSOC ask An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na why it was not told about the issue and, if so, was it given an answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#R00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":211,"content":"<p>We have been in contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that regard and I do not think it sees that there was a need to tell GSOC.

It is even more troubling given that we were discussed the same matters three years ago.  At that time, we were a little more upbeat because GSOC had gone to the trouble of detailing the legislative provision that would have sorted out this matter.  Now we see not only the lack of change in that respect and its impact on the day-to-day work of GSOC.  Ms Justice Ring has put on record that in the protected disclosures incidents, some people have been incredibly damaged by what has happened to them or what they perceive to have happened to them without adequate investigation.  Some investigations last for days.  Ms Justice Ring stated that GSOC continues to experience major difficulty accessing documentation.

I presume that most of the people in these circumstances are not in work.<\/p> <p>  What is the level of crossover?  I am aware of one protected disclosure involving a very serious case of alleged Garda involvement in the drugs trade on which GSOC has finished its report.  In tandem with the GSOC investigation, the Garda carried out an internal investigation which was still not finished after about four years.  GSOC, however, is not able to publish its report until the Garda investigation concludes.  Is that not the biggest flaw of all?  Does this not stunt the work of GSOC?

GSOC may be investigating a complaint that the Garda is investigating, but we may not know that until very late in the day.  It may be very far advanced in that regard because it is closer to the information, which then causes problems for our investigation.  If we are going to have the structure that allows for two organisations to take protected disclosures from staff then some effort should be made to allow for better management of the protected disclosures.  We raised this in the general sense when submissions were sought by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, about the fact that we cannot talk to the Department of Justice and Equality, which may have had a letter or a submission, we cannot talk to the Policing Authority, which may also have received a letter or submission, and the Garda.  Four bodies, therefore, may have information about the same complaint but there is no mechanism to allow us to disclose information except in a formal investigative way with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In the minor complaints area, there are even categories within that.  We categorise some as service level complaints where a level of public service, perhaps as simple as common politeness, is allegedly not observed and delivered to a complainant by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These are the subject of the local intervention scheme to which Ms Justice Ring was referred in our opening statement.  We have tried to establish local intervention and in fairness to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it engaged positively with it, especially at pilot stage.  The scheme is showing green shoots and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has looked to roll it out widely, although not fully nationwide.<\/p><p> That would deal with minor complaints on matters such as the non-return of a phone call or simple impoliteness or discourtesy.  However, there is another level of complaint that would still be less serious, depending on one's perspective, involving discourtesies that are not suitable for local intervention and the individual in question feels he or she needs the vindication of bringing a complaint to an oversight body.  Such complaints come to us and would continue to come to us in future according to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Under the current legislation, we can send many of these complaints back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That would not be the case in the future, however, as we would deal with these complaints ourselves.  That is why, for example, Ms Justice Ring referred to the issue of resources for this task because these complaints obviously command a fair amount of Garda resources and would require our resources in future.  We have no difficulty with that and it is right that they would come to us.<\/p><p> Where appropriate, local intervention is a very worthwhile initiative and one which we will try to reinforce.  We will work positively and closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement it.  Many of these matters are a basic public service and should not be the subject of complicated investigative mechanisms that are resource heavy, adversarial and confrontational.  The whole process is currently structured around finding a garda guilty of misconduct or of a crime.  In the new legislation, we are trying to focus on resolving the problem.  Resolving the problem is much more significant at the minor level.  In respect of more serious complaints where serious misconduct or a crime might be alleged, other sanctions are obviously more appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I recognise that and I agree with Mr. Fitzgerald that a complaint should be a complaint should be one that is related to serious misconduct or indicating criminal activity.

She and her colleague, Superintendent Helen Deely, have been excellent to work with.  They are supported by Assistant Commissioner David Sheahan and, ultimately, the Garda Commissioner.

The person who asks for the information takes what is supplied to them in good faith and they pass it on to us but the question is whether they got all the information they wanted and whether, in turn, we got what we wanted.  There is a sign of change and while this has to come from the top, it also needs to be recognised throughout the organisation.

In the years that followed, GSOC and many other organisations had to grapple with the practical reality of how to investigate a protected disclosure.  Given the complexity around the Garda, we sought legal advice as to how to deal with these cases and it has been a step by step process to move forward on a complaint, gather information and at the same time protect the identity of a person.

Those are three options: DPP, discipline, or, under section 101(7), finding no misconduct and close the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring"},{"type":"speech","time":1557270000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Therefore, once it has be referred through the section 101, it cannot be discontinued under section 93.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#DD00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>It comes to us and we have to make a decision in accordance with what the Act says.

For instance, we opened a public interest investigation when a firearm discharge occurred at Shannon Airport.  A plane had landed and been detained and a firearm discharged accidentally into the tarmac.  Fortunately, no damage was caused to property or a person.  However, because of the proximity of the discharge to aeroplanes and given the nature of the airport as a public place, we thought in that instance that it was important to open an investigation.  Perhaps now, with our greater resources, we are in a position to say we should open one in every instance, but we look at discharges on a case by case basis.

If someone comes to us straightaway, we have 18 months.  If someone does not come to us until six months after the offence, we only have 12 months.  If he or she comes to us 12 months after it, we have six months.  Therefore, a lot depends on when we receive the complaint in the first instance.  Our practice is to keep a very close eye on the statute, but it is not always possible at the outset of an investigation to know that what we are investigating is a summary matter.  We may not realise until after we have gathered evidence that, despite the seriousness attached to the complaint at the outset, the evidence relates to a more minor matter.  We are always conscious of the timeframe.  Have we ever gone outside it?  Again, I cannot say off the top of my head, but it is possible.

If they are to come under GSOC's direct attention once again, there will have to be a significant increase in resources to cope.  This is very clear and I am of the view that GSOC would have the support of the committee in its entirety in that regard.  It is something we will most definitely do.<\/p> <p>  In the context of some of our recent reports on community policing and rural crime, Ms Justice Ring highlighted the fact that garda&iacute; are being diverted from their usual policing duties in order to address a plethora of these GSOC investigations.

I must say with some disappointment that it will not just set in at an early stage, it will be carried forward if people do not hear what Ms Justice Ring is saying and what we are reflecting on.  It would be of significant concern that the new body would start off not just having to prove itself but that it would also be obliged to carry forward a considerable lack of public confidence.  When Deputy Clare Daly referenced damage, I made the note that the damage had been done to GSOC in terms of public confidence by virtue of the fact that the resourcing was not all it should have been.<\/p> <p>  It was stated that GSOC could not just tell people to go away.  In that context, I am familiar with a case that has been submitted to GSOC.  I do not know whether it is standard procedure, but the correspondence issuing indicated that GSOC would make an arrangement to meet, interview and explore with the complainant the details initially provided in writing.  Some time later, a letter issued stating that GSOC had made a decision, yet there had been no engagement at all with the complainant.  How often would this be the case?  In the specific instance with which I am familiar, it has had a damaging impact.  The case involves very respectable and considered people who would not have made a complaint to GSOC willy-nilly .  The complaint had substance and a basis of concern, yet they were never afforded the opportunity that the correspondence from GSOC indicated would be theirs, namely, to be met, have their case heard, answer questions, elaborate and do what they and we all would have expected would have been their opportunity to do.  It never happened and they then received correspondence indicating that the matter had been discontinued without explanation.  I have copies of those items of correspondence.

I do not know whether this was unusual or if it is a frequent occurrence that people do not get their day in court, so to speak.<\/p><p>It is important at least that people be afforded the opportunity to expand on the information they have provided.

In the case I have mentioned a decision, so-called, has issued.  I would like to comment on a case that has been referred to GSOC in the relatively recent past, but I am restricted somewhat in how I can reference it.  I endeavoured to raise the matter on the floor of the D&aacute;il and ask a question on behalf of my community about a significant Garda deployment that had had an adverse consequence for a resident in the broader community.  I do not know the person concerned and have never met them.  I know nothing about the nature of the exercise, but I understand it involved a significant number of heavily armed and black-clad members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When the local media raised the matter with the Garda Press Office, they received the short and inaccurate response that the matter had been referred to GSOC and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be offering no further explanation or would not shed further light on the matter.  Taking account of international news, etc. which influences people's thought processes, there has been every imaginable, possible explanation for this exercise.  That is not appropriate.  People living in the community from where the person concerned comes are immediately suspect and labelled as being associated with serious matters with which they - I hope I am correct in saying this - have no association.  I am a little fearful because the Minister's response was that as the matter had been referred to GSOC, he could offer no further illumination.  Is Ms Justice Ring concerned that GSOC, in the referral to it of certain matters, is being used as a means of holding back critical information?  As an elected representative, I have a role and a responsibility to try to elucidate information on what is happening.<\/p><p>This has not happened in my memory, living in the community all the many decades I have chalked up at this point.  This was so unusual but nobody will offer any explanation whatever.  The GSOC referral is the reason, according the Garda press office and the Minister on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  That causes me concern.  Do the witnesses have any concern about GSOC being employed, used or misused in such a case?  Would GSOC's addressing of this matter take on board the wider consideration of what is reasonable?  Communities appreciate transparency and having some sense of what this is about.  There is a negative or a downside that can arise from the holding back of all information.  Others from the person's community have come to me in fear and every suggestion has been put as to what the wider interests might be, not only domestically but internationally and globally.  Nothing could be further from the truth, they say, although I do not know.  I am not an investigator or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On behalf of my community, I am only trying to establish whether this is something that will become a feature of life going forward.  How will people address it and why would the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be so tight-lipped on the matter?<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  I am obviously compromised in how I can refer to this.  I hope I have been careful enough and I understand the witnesses must also be careful and may perhaps be even more careful in replying to me.  My first question is whether GSOC has concerns and the second question is whether it will consider the wider aspect of what is appropriate in deploying 20 or more heavily armed people in this way.  What would give rise to such an action?  For me it would be a concern that they might be met by a similar weight of force.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019050800002#HH00500","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557270000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I cannot say what is in the mind of anyone who refers a matter to us except that I hope he or she is following obligations and doing nothing more than that.

It would be our hope that everything would come to us as a matter of course and then we would not have to think about what is in the minds of the referring parties.  It has happened that we have got a referral closely followed by a press inquiry.  That is a fact that clearly raises questions for us as to how quickly the press discovers that a matter has come to us and why.  I cannot speculate on what is in the minds of people who send matters to us.  There are matters that come to us with great speed and they can be followed at even greater speed by queries from the media.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about our remit and we have set out in our workflow diagram the restrictions we have.  The main restriction, which we have already said we would like to see dealt with under new legislation, comes where citizen A complains about garda B or garda&iacute; B, C and D.  It is all we can investigate.  In some instances we could go beyond that into a public interest investigation but again we would be looking at individuals.<\/p><p>As we have no role in operational matters, we cannot tell the Garda how to do its job.  We can only look at the outcome of the job and whether it displays misconduct, either criminal or disciplinary.  Again, under the current legislation, we are back to looking at the actions of A, B or C.  If A, B or C is acting in accordance with directions, for instance, than it is not misconduct.  If he or she is in a given place for an operational reason, it is not misconduct.  If we can look at an incident from the overview of the individuals involved, that may give us more scope.  We know it is frustrating when people make a complaint about an incident to GSOC and we have to extract from them or the Garda information on which individuals were involved.  The individuals in question may say they were acting in accordance with what they were told to do.  All that GSOC can say in such circumstances is that there was no misconduct.  We cannot say we thought it was bad judgment or anything about it operationally.  We can make recommendations for the future.  However, under the current legislation, we do not have recommendation powers and the Garda can, therefore, ignore our recommendations.<\/p><p> GSOC operates in that maze.  This affects the expectations the public have of us.  We must follow the steps.  We have indicated to the Department of Justice and Equality that we would like to have a legislative framework in place under which a complaint, which can be any kind of allegation, results in an investigation that is fair, proportionate and in accordance with the law.  Moreover, it should have one of three outcomes, either the matter goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Garda Commissioner or GSOC finds no misconduct by any party.
