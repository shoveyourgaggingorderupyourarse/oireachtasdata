The programme provides specific reference to delivering on objectives in line with the SDGs in many areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) will lead the development of Ireland&rsquo;s second SDG National Implementation Plan in 2021. Both the SDG interdepartmental governance structure and the SDG Stakeholder Forum with key input from civil society and relevant sectors will support this work in ensuring Ireland upholds its SDG responsibilities. <\/p>  <p>  Monitoring and reporting is a key part of ensuring Ireland continues its progress towards targets set out under the Sustainable Development Goals. Monitoring progress through the Central Statistics Office (CSO) SDG GeoHive and regular updating of the Policy Map Matrix of the Goals will help ensure that Ireland upholds its responsibilities under the Sustainable Development Goals. This monitoring will also allow for more coherent implementation of the Goals. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to labour exploitation, the Department of Foreign Affairs is the lead Department on target 8.7 under the UN Sustainable Development Goals which aims to take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, including child labour - as set out under the Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the National Plan on Business and Human Rights was launched to give effect to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The National Plan, overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs, aims to promote responsible business practices at home and overseas, including in developing countries, by all Irish business enterprises. This first national plan contains a range of actions, which are being implemented across government. Through the term of this plan Ireland has continued to engage with international partners through its annual participation in the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights. <\/p>  <p>  In the coming months, the Government will publish a toolkit for Irish companies to help guide them in discharging their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This will be a valuable resource for Irish business &ndash; providing information, guidance and a number of case studies provided by businesses that have embraced the UN Guiding Principles and can provide valuable learnings and advice.<\/p>  <p>  In the first half of 2021 there will be a preliminary review of the progress made in implementing the first National Plan. Later in the year, the Government will begin to develop the second iteration of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The second National Plan will be informed by the initiative underway in the European Commission to bring forward legislative proposals in the area of sustainable corporate governance. The Commission will propose changes to the EU regulatory framework on company law and corporate governance, to ensure that companies focus on long-term sustainable value creation, rather than short-term benefits. The aim is to help companies to better manage sustainability-related matters in their own operations and value chains as regards social and human rights, climate change, the environment, and so on.  We expect to see the detail of this proposal in Q2 this year.<\/p>  <p>  Safeguards in the areas of sustainable development and labour are further strengthened by Ireland&rsquo;s membership and engagement with the International Labour Organisation. In 2017, Ireland took up a Titulaire Seat on the Governing Body of the ILO for the first time. This will allow Ireland to further its input into international business and human rights through the ILO.<\/p>  <p>  From a Trade Policy perspective, Ireland supports the broader positive EU approach to sustainable development through efforts to ensure that there are strong and ambitious chapters on Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) in Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), as part of the EU&rsquo;s value-based trade policy, that are consistent with international legal commitments and standards.  Furthermore, <\/p>  <p>  the EU&rsquo;s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) also seeks to play a role in promoting the Sustainability agenda.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland seeks to promote responsible business conduct through my Department&rsquo;s hosting of the National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which aim to encourage the positive contributions that multinational enterprises can make to economic, environmental and social progress and to minimise the difficulties to which their various operations may give rise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[7925\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if a derogation for flour coming from the UK to Ireland can be issued for a company (details supplied).","asker":"1568","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[7976\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his views on the post-Brexit reality of the application of the rules of origin laws that sees Irish bread producers facing higher production costs than their UK counterparts due to having to import flour that is not being milled domestically; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":30,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the issues that have arisen for the bakery sector as identified by the Deputies.  I fully understand that despite making preparations in advance for Brexit, agreeing the full terms of the TCA so close to 1 January 2021 did not allow many sectors, including the bakery sector, to prepare for the implications arising under the specific Rules of Origin provisions of the Agreement.  This has led, in this case, to the imposition of tariffs on imports of particular flour from the UK given the level of non-UK\/non-EU wheat input contained in that particular flour. <\/p>  <p>  At its simplest, the Rules of Origin are the premise upon which any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) seeks to confer the preferential tariff rates - zero in the case of the TCA - on the members of the Free Trade Area encompassed by the FTA, namely the UK and EU-27 in this instance.  Moreover, it is usual that Product Specific Rules of Origin will set out how much, if any, non-originating or Third Country inputs that is permitted before exceeding the relevant thresholds to enjoy the tariff preferences\/benefits of the FTA.  In this case, an upper limit of 15% Third Country wheat input to UK exports of flour to the EU is allowable under the TCA and currently, the UK flour being imported by the sector contains 45% Canadian wheat which puts it outside of the scope for benefiting from the preferential tariff rates.  Pre-Brexit, the trade agreement between the EU and Canada addressed this issue but the UK is no longer a beneficiary of CETA and there is no three-way Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the UK and the EU.  Therefore, supply chain changes would be needed to fully benefit from the terms of the TCA. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department and I are fully conscious of the potential employment and cost implications arising for the sector as the industry representatives have made clear, as well as possible price implications for consumers. I also recognise the competitive disadvantage that the sector faces in retaining UK market share when faced with competitors that are not affected by the tariffs given how the Irish sector's supply chains have been constructed over many years.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department and right across Government continue to work intensively to work through possible technical solutions to address issues arising for the sector from the conclusion of the TCA. In the case of the tariffs on flour, my officials have examined the issue with colleagues in Revenue to explore what technical solutions may be available within the terms of the TCA, including that of using Inward Processing relief. Such Inward Processing solutions can assist companies in terms of retaining UK market share, but I appreciate that it does not provide a complete solution for the issues presenting on the domestic market.  In that latter regard, I recently wrote to the Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on the issue and raised the matter with him when we spoke last week.  I highlighted for the Commission the extent of the sector&rsquo;s reliance on the UK, with over 80% of the flour imported from the UK, a factor that is compounded by the lack of indigenous milling capacity on the island of Ireland.  Furthermore, given that the conclusion of the TCA in late December did not allow time for the sector to make the necessary adjustments in its supply chains, I have asked the Commission Services to examine the issue to consider any flexibilities that can be applied and I await the Commission's considered response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB01300"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[8007\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if the situation regarding dual purpose stores (details supplied) will be clarified; and the entitlement of dual purpose stores and their continued trade in non-essential items to the detriment of stores already closed by level 5 regulations.","asker":"1454","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p>Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, only essential retail outlets will remain open.

The lists are subject to twice yearly reviews which are evidence based and are guided by available research, a public consultation and input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The pilot quota-based scheme introduced in May 2018 following consideration of a detailed business case submitted by the sector, provided a quota of 150 general employment permits for the occupation of Dairy Farm Assistant.  This pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector and the quota of 150 employment permits is now exhausted and has not been extended.  Consideration of the submissions received to the current occupation list review is underway with the review scheduled to be finalised in early March. <\/p>  <p>  Last month, Minister of State Damien English TD, engaged with the Irish Farmers Association and Producers on matters relating to employment in the agri-food sector in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  All permits granted are employer and employee specific and granted for the purposes of the employment stated on the permit.  Where a permit holder wishes to change employer a new application for an employment permit should be made.  As the quota of Dairy Farm Assistant is currently expired, at present no further general employment permits can issue for the role of Dairy Farm Assistant.  <\/p>  <p>  Applications for employment permits may be made by either the employer or the employee.  A range of information on submitting applications is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.

Employment permit legislation prohibits deductions in respect of employment permit application process from employee remuneration. <\/p>  <p>  If an employment is the first for which they have held an employment permit in Ireland, the permit holder is expected to remain in that employment for a period of twelve months before applying for a new employment permit.

This measure is to assist those who are trying to restart their businesses and will allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs without losing their entitlement to the PUP.<\/p><p>The Government also announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector in Budget 2021. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country.

It will also be informed by the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.<\/p><p>The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries.

The aim of the Measures is to manage the volume of steel entering the EU Single Market from 3rd countries as a consequent of the threat of EU market distortion by the dumping of steel originally intended for the US market onto the EU market as a result of the original US tariffs. The Measures currently in place allow for the importation of steel from 3rd countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel. These current measures are due to expire at the end of June 2021, unless prolonged after a further review which is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>Due to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, as of 1 January 2021, the UK is no longer party to the EU&rsquo;s Measures and the UK is now a 3rd country in relation to the application of the EU&rsquo;s Safeguard Measures. In anticipation of the UK&rsquo;s new status outside of the EU, in September 2020, the UK Government issued a notice stating that it would establish its own set of Safeguard Measures and calculated its own quota levels for imports of steel products from 3rd countries, including the EU into the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Irish importers can continue to import steel from the UK without the additional \"Safeguard\" tariff of 25% if the volume of imports remains within the EU's quota allocations for the UK.  Imports from the UK to Ireland, or other EU Member States, in excess of these quotas will attract a 25% tariff. Similarly, imports of steel from other 3rd countries into Ireland would only be subject to a 25% tariff if the exporting country exceeds the available quota. Importantly, however, Irish importers can continue to import steel from the rest of the EU as part of the Single Market where no tariffs or quotas apply.<\/p>  <p>  In applying the Safeguard Measures, the European Commission has completed 2 reviews of the Measures, with the most recent review published in June 2020. The findings of that review included details on the availability of quotas for each product category. The Commission's review found that in the last quarter of year-2 of the measures (i.e. April - June 2020), a significant level of quotas remained unused, with quotas available in every product category.  <\/p>  <p>  The review also noted that as of 15 May 2020, there were 9 million tonnes, or 29% of the total quotas, available for use in year-2 of the Measures ('year-3' of the Measures began in July 2020). This would indicate that the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures does not affect the availability of supply, as quotas are not exhausted before the end of a given period. Quotas available for steel reflect traditional levels of trade in steel and the Commission's evidence suggests that the quotas are not being exhausted and that the market remains competitive.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, neither my Department, nor any of our Enterprise Agencies, is aware of any supply concerns by industry regarding imports of steel into Ireland, however officials within the Department are engaged with industry groups to monitor any unforeseen impacts of the current measures. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is my understanding that the Commission are examining possible amendments to Union legislation on tariff rate quotas to resolve issues relating to steel from Great Britain imported into Northern Ireland coming within the scope of the current Safeguard Measures. Officials in my Department will continue to monitor the situation and they remain actively engaged with the Commission on the matter including the interplay between the Measures and the Northern Ireland Protocol with the view of finalising how measures should operate and apply in respect of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB06900"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[8889\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700059#WRB07000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the contracts for public relations advice and consultancy entered into by his Department over the cost of &euro;10,000 since January 2021; the nature of the contracts; and the length of the contract in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>My Department has entered into one such contract since the 1st January 2021.

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  Government support for all public transport services in 2020 amounted to over &euro;620m.  For 2021 over &euro;670m has been provided in funding in order to ensure that the existing level of public transport services, albeit at a higher cost, continue to operate in a safe manner. By comparison, the level of PSO and Local Link funding provided in 2019 was in the region of &euro;300m.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, last summer the  Government approved temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services, and the duration of this support was recently extended.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's  Living with Covid Plan, clearly sets out the guidance and restrictions that will apply for all sectors, including public transport, at the 5 levels of the Plan, including strong messaging that people should use active travel as an alternative where this is feasible.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, most notably, essential workers.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services  and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

States which are a party to this convention may endorse certificates attesting recognition issued by other states in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Convention. In addition to the STCW Convention, EU legislation has provided for a wider range of recognitions amongst member states in accordance with Directive 2008\/106, as amended. The United Kingdom left the European Union at the end of January 2020 and entered a transition phase which continued to apply EU legislation to the United Kingdom. The transition phase ended at midnight CET on the 31st of December 2020. On this basis EU Directives including those on mutual recognition ceased to apply to the United Kingdom from this time. <\/p>  <p>  In preparation for the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the end of the transition phase the European Commission issued Brexit Preparedness Notices to advise of the implications including the impact on seafarers qualifications. My Department promulgated these by means of Marine Notices, the most recent Marine Notice Number 35 of 2020 was issued in August of last year. In particular, these Preparedness Notices explained the two types of recognition including recognition by acceptance and recognition by endorsement.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to recognition by endorsement my Department has been actively engaged with ensuring the minimum amount of disruption to seafarers and shipping companies caused by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s departure from the European Union. On this basis, Ireland initiated the EU recognition process under the Directive on the 1st of January 2021 and my Department signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom in January 2021. These actions by Ireland have also initiated a wider process by the European Commission and it is anticipated that the European Maritime Safety Agency will be tasked to carry out an assessment of the United Kingdom to assess its implementation of the IMO STCW Convention.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that in relation to those certificates which are subject to recognition by acceptance rather than recognition by endorsement the European Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Preparedness Notice states &ldquo;The certificates issued to seafarers by the United Kingdom are no longer &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by an EU Member State under Article 5b of Directive 2008\/106\/EC after the end of the transition period. Thus, a master or an officer holding a certificate issued by the United Kingdom &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by an EU Member State will not be able to continue working on board vessels flying the flag of that Member State after the end of the transition period.&rdquo; Seafarers are advised to be guided by the Brexit Preparedness Notices issued by the European Commission and as published by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In this case it is noted from the information supplied that the candidate has attended a course after the end of the transition period which has been approved by the United Kingdom Authorities.

The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate those EV owners who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets, by enabling them to charge their EVs near their homes.

Revenue has two import systems &ndash; Automated Entry Processing (AEP) and a new system, the Automated Import System (AIS). The AEP system has not had any outages since 23 November 2020. However, since its launch on 23 November 2020, AIS has been unavailable on four occasions.  Three of these outages related to scheduled maintenance and on two of these occasions the resulting restart unfortunately, took longer than planned, resulting in prolonged downtime. The fourth incident arose when a technical issue required the system to be restarted.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that since the UKs departure from the EU, and while monitoring activity levels within their systems, it identified degradation in performance of AIS during times of peak processing resulting in delayed responses to declarations and other messages lodged by trade.  One of the contributing factors to the levels of transactions being presented for processing is the growth in the business levels of large filers with high volumes of small consignments, a business model which has increased significantly with the move to online shopping since the start of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that a delay in processing creates difficulties for trade and business and that the impact of delays for some businesses can appear as if the AIS system is not actually available when it is but is operating considerably below the performance level required and expected by trade and business. In instances when the delays are substantial, Revenue has taken actions to allow businesses to continue to move their goods.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is working with its software provider to increase capacity at peak processing times and that certain measures taken to date have improved performance and resilience and that this work is continuing.  At the same time Revenue is working with large filers, to develop tailored solutions that will facilitate their business model and ensure that other goods traffic is not adversely impacted by peak load processing delays. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue continues to monitor customs systems performance and where any delays are identified that have the potential to impact businesses, Revenue will take timely actions to ensure that businesses can continue to move goods.

This means that for the purposes of trade and the movement of goods between the EU and the UK, the UK is now a 3rd country and therefore a range of customs formalities and other regulatory controls apply to goods moving to, from or through the United Kingdom, excluding Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Customs is an EU competence and Ireland, like all EU Member States, must implement import requirements as set out in the Union Customs Code (UCC), the legal framework for customs rules and procedures in the EU customs territory. Compliance with these rules are essential to maintaining the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union.  Deficiencies in Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the relevant regulatory controls and requirements could have serious consequences for exports from Ireland and their automatic right of free circulation within the European Union.<\/p>  <p>I know that Revenue fully understands and appreciates that some businesses have experienced and continue to experience difficulties adjusting to the need to comply with the new customs and other regulatory formalities that now apply to trade with Great Britain. Revenue has been working closely with trade both at individual business level and with the range of trade and business representative bodies in order to assist them in meeting the challenges which the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU has brought for Irish businesses. Revenue also has a 24\/7 presence at Dublin and Rosslare ports and help is also available via the Customs 24\/7 telephone helpline (01 738 3685) and via email helpline channels. As part of this active engagement with business Revenue continues to explore with business the opportunities to avail of certain simplifications and facilitations that are available in accordance with the UCC.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has also provided a range of supports to assist businesses in adapting to the new formalities and procedures that are now in place, including the Ready for Customs Grant scheme and the Clear Customs training programme which are particularly relevant to the challenges referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I think it is important to note that approx. 75% of all freight movements during January were green routed and permitted to leave the ports without any interaction with Customs or the other regulatory authorities. However, as Great Britain is now a 3rd country, and goods traded with them are subject to sanitary and phytosanitary checks, checks that are essential to public health and safety, it will never be possible for all goods movement arriving into Ireland from Great Britain to be green routed. There will always be a level of documentary or physical examination of goods movements required as part of Ireland&rsquo;s obligation to protect the Single Market and the Customs Union and the same applies to all other EU Member States importing goods from the UK.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[7891\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff assigned to the Revenue Commissioners' enforcement units at all airports here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that as an integrated tax and customs administration, it deploys resources based on evolving business needs and to tackle any risks as they emerge. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue staff at airports are deployed to a range of  trade facilitation, service delivery and enforcement  duties.

and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 160 to 165, inclusive, 177 and 178 together.<\/p><p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a social welfare payment for workers who have become unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PUP payments are classified as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).<\/p><p>The PUP along with the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced in March 2020 as emergency measures to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The Government objective at that time was to get much needed assistance to employees as quickly as possible.  To meet that objective, both subsidies were not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in the normal manner, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was based on an expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out to not be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's suggestion that I ask Revenue to waive any liabilities arising from the payment of the PUP, questions of equity arise. Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages,  in the interest of equity, payments under the PUP are subject to income tax. Furthermore, Revenue is independent in the exercise of its functions. <\/p><p>Revenue have advised me as follows: <\/p><p>The impact of the &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; approach is that some PUP and TWSS recipients now have an additional tax liability for 2020. As confirmed by Revenue last September, these liabilities will be collected, interest free, by reducing the employees tax credits over four years, starting in January 2022. Alternatively, an employee can opt to fully or partially pay any additional liability as a single sum through the Payments\/Repayments facility in the myAccount service. These arrangements remain in place and are fully available to PUP and TWSS recipients.<\/p><p>When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the PUP claim with the Department of Social Protection (DSP). In turn, DSP will notify Revenue that the payment has ceased, and Revenue will then adjust the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly. It is not the case that the employee is taxed on the full year calculation of PUP, where a return to work has occurred during the year, with a requirement to seek a refund for the overpaid amount (as suggested in Deputy O'Dowd's question). This is purely a mechanism to reflect the fact that the person is in receipt of PUP. For a person who is in receipt of PUP at the start of the year, the weekly amount is annualised on the Tax Credit Cert (TCC), with knock on impacts on the tax credit and standard rate cut off point, as if that person will be on PUP for the full year. When the person comes off PUP, the TCC is amended to reflect the fact that the payment has ceased. A revised instruction (Revenue Payroll Notification) will issue to the relevant employer to reflect the updated position and the revised TCC will issue to the employee via the online myAccount service. <\/p><p>Revenue has published information on the taxation of the PUP at link:  <i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/life-events-and-personal-circumstances\/pup-tax-liability\/index.aspx,<\/i>which may be of interest to the Deputies. Revenue has also very clearly set out how the taxation of the PUP and EWSS will occur in 2021. <\/p><p>The replacing of the TWSS with the EWSS from 1 September 2020 and the continuation of both that scheme and the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, those people receiving PUP payments in 2021 will only pay tax when they return to work. The mechanism to tax PUP payments is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands.  <\/p><p>Income tax is normally calculated using the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo;, which means that for each pay day, all earnings and all tax credits are accumulated, and the tax due is calculated on a year to date basis. This ensures employees pay the correct amount of tax as it falls due. In exceptional circumstances, employees may be placed on the &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis (also known as the &lsquo;non-cumulative basis&rsquo;). This normally occurs where there is a large reduction in tax credits that could cause financial hardship or where there is a lack of information on prior employments within the current tax year. Where employees are placed on a &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis, income tax is deducted on a pay-period to pay-period arrangement, without reference to previous pay or tax paid. As such the employee will not suffer a large deduction of tax in a pay-period but will also not receive any refunds that might be due until the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo; is implemented. These normal taxing arrangements are operating in respect of PUP payments received by employees in 2021 and are in accordance with the legislation as set down. <\/p><p>Regarding the TWSS, it is important to note that any additional &lsquo;top up payments&rsquo; made by employers to employees during 2020 under the TWSS were taxed in the normal (real-time) manner and are generally not included in the year-end arrangement. Top-up payments in addition to the basic subsidy would have very likely given rise to a tax liability, even if only paid over the course of 12 weeks.  It was therefore wholly appropriate that PAYE operated in respect of such payments in the normal way as it is did for other earners through the period, with the deduction of income tax and USC in 2020. <\/p><p>Specifically, regarding the taxation of PUP, the following points are also relevant:<\/p><p>- A single person currently in receipt of the PUP will continue to receive the payment gross and tax is not collected from these payments until s\/he returns to work.  This is also the case where both married spouses\/civil partners are receiving PUP;<\/p><p>- 50% of all PUP recipients are not on the highest rate of &euro;350 per week. A single person&rsquo;s weekly tax credits will fully cover any tax due on weekly PUP payments at the &euro;203, &euro;250 and &euro;300 payment rates.<\/p><p>- For these rates, the employee will in fact have excess weekly tax credits of between &euro;3.46 and &euro;22.86 which will build up for the period s\/he is out of work. This means that the employee will have additional tax credits to offset against income when s\/he returns to work;<\/p><p>- For a single person in receipt of PUP of &euro;350 per week, his\/her weekly tax credits cover 90% of the tax payable, leaving tax due of approximately &euro;6.50 per week.<\/p><p>USC is not chargeable on PUP payments which will either fully or partially offset any tax impact on overall net wages and should be borne in mind.<\/p><p>If a single person is in receipt of the PUP from January 2021 to end of June 2021 before then returning to work (i.e. 26 payments of PUP at &euro;350 per week = &euro;9,100), the total outstanding tax due on the payments received at that point is approximately &euro;170. By adjusting the employee&rsquo;s tax credits while he or she is receiving the PUP payment, as outlined above, this, eliminates or reduces any liability at year end. Any such liability will also be fully or partly offset by the reduction in the total USC liability for the year because, as explained above, PUP payments are not liable to USC. In effect, this means that, in most cases, the net take home pay of PUP recipients that return to employment will be unaffected by the taxation measures.<\/p><p>The position for married couples\/civil partners is slightly different. Where a couple is taxed under joint assessment and one spouse or civil partner is in receipt of the PUP but does not have sufficient tax credits to cover the tax due, the tax credits of the working spouse or civil partner are reduced to ensure that the balance of the tax is collected during the year. Effectively, the personal tax credit of the PUP recipient is not assigned to the working spouse in the usual manner as it is instead allocated to the excess PUP amount over and above the (PUP) recipient&rsquo;s PAYE tax credit and rate band.<\/p><p>Finally, in taxing PUP payments in accordance with the legislation, Revenue is seeking to ensure, as far as possible, that people do not end up with a tax liability at the end of 2021 that will have to be paid in future years, particularly where there is already an underpayment in respect of 2020. The alternative &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; approach would result in employees having further underpayments in the years ahead in addition to their 2020 liabilities, which could cause financial difficulties for them down the road. The normal deduction arrangements now applying to both EWSS and PUP for 2021 seeks to insure against this, as tax credits are set aside for offset against any tax due. The arrangement also ensures an equity of tax treatment between those receiving the PUP and employees who are working and receiving similar levels of wages (although the person on PUP will have a lower USC liability). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG02200"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[7979\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) can be facilitated for the full payment of their AMRF pension; if the case can be fully and favourably investigated given their current circumstances; if the policy entails a death benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that an individual who is under the age of 75 at the time of exercising the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) option and does not meet the requirement in section 784C(4) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) of having a minimum guaranteed pension or annuity income for life of &euro;12,700 per annum, is required under that section to set aside an amount of &euro;63,500 from the pension fund (or the remainder of the fund, if less than &euro;63,500 after taking a retirement lump sum) by investing the amount in an Approved Minimum Requirement Fund (AMRF) or by the purchase of an annuity. <\/p>  <p>  A maximum of 4% of the AMRF value may be withdrawn annually and withdrawals are subject to tax.

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. <\/p>  <p>  The application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank. <\/p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in the main it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[8409\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to extend the stay and spend tax credit initiative beyond April 2021.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":449,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[8638\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide information on the stay and spend scheme; the number of businesses registered; the total stay and spend receipt uploads for accommodation, food and accommodation and for food only; the value accrued on the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":450,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 159 together.<\/p>  <p>The purpose of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit scheme is to provide targeted support to businesses within the hospitality sector whose operations are likely to be most affected by continued restrictions on public health grounds. In order to claim the Stay and Spend Tax Credit, taxpayers are required to upload a copy of their receipt(s) for qualifying expenditure to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and then make a formal claim for the tax credit when submitting their annual Income Tax Return. <\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme a claim may be made in relation to qualifying expenditure incurred between the period 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021. Broadly, qualifying expenditure includes expenditure on either holiday accommodation or &ldquo;eat in&rdquo; food and drink, with a minimum expenditure amount of &euro;25 per transaction being required. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates, and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted.   Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, thus far, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged. Stay and Spend is scheduled to operate until 30 April but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date (to end 2021).  It is too early as yet to take definitive decisions in that regard.  Much will depend on how circumstances unfold in the months ahead.  As I have said before, I will keep an eye on how matters develop and the role that the scheme might play and consider if any changes need to be made. <\/p>  <p>  Claims relating to qualifying expenditure incurred in the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2020 can be made when an individual is submitting his\/her 2020 Income Tax Return, which is now available for submission.  <\/p>  <p>  As at 10 February 2021, the number of business registered to take part in the Stay and Spend scheme is 3,137. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 51,494 receipts have been uploaded by taxpayers to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and the expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;8,406,533. The potential tax cost is &euro;1,681,307 assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Of the 51,494 receipts uploaded 9,917 relate to accommodation and food, 8,185 for accommodation only and 33,392 for food only. <\/p>  <p>  As at 14 February 2021 a total of 7,799 claims have been included in 2020 Income Tax Returns. These claims relate to &euro;2,755,230 of the qualifying expenditure recorded on the Revenue Receipts Tracker to date and the tax cost of same amounts to &euro;551,046. However, as the filing deadline for the 2020 Income Tax Return is not until 31 October 2021, information on the total number of claims and cost for the 2020 year of assessment will not be available until after the filing date and the returns have been processed.  <\/p>  <p>  Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this new scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme.<\/p>  <p>  It is important also to recall that Stay and Spend should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9 % from 1 November 2020. This is a temporary measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity, and will apply from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond. I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG06300"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[8429\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG06400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 228 of 27 January 2021, the reason County Roscommon is not carrying out assessments; when the county will carry out assessments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers Scheme in primary legislation.

Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the particular issue of extending the period of a mortgage approval in principle, the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an Approval in Principle. That is a commercial and business matter for a particular lender.  However, a lender should make the duration of any offer of Approval in Principle clear to a consumer, in line with the requirement of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 to provide clear information to a consumer and bring their attention to key information.<\/p>  <p>  More generally there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the separate issue of controls on house visiting during the pandemic period, that is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG06900"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[8463\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG07000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the wage subsidy scheme (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>Since the COVID-19 situation first arose, I have maintained contact with the BPFI and lenders on the measures they have put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by the pandemic.

Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":460,"content":"<p>Question No. 155 answered with Question No. 150.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[8527\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG07400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason employees are taxed on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and-or the employee wage subsidy scheme element of their wages and salaries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":463,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March 2020. It was an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.  Over 66,500 employers were supported through the TWSS in respect of more than 664,000 employees at a cost of &euro;2.9bn. The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.<\/p><p>Payments made under the TWSS were regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC).  It is noted however that a zero rate of PRSI applied for the purposes of employee PRSI contributions under the TWSS.  The taxation treatment of TWSS payments was legislated for in section 28(5)(e) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.<\/p><p>While income tax and the USC on earnings are generally deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, tax was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system while the TWSS was in operation.  Instead, liability to tax was to be calculated by Revenue through the regular end of year review process.  This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most, when the TWSS was first announced and expected to only be in place for 12 weeks.  When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.  This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or PUP on the &lsquo;<i>week 1 basis<\/i>&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end. <\/p><p>The final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including a person&rsquo;s civil status, their available tax credits, the amount received under TWSS and\/or PUP, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses.  <\/p><p>Revenue will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the TWSS and has given assurances that if any income tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022. <\/p><p>It is also understood that Revenue are facilitating employers who wish to pay the tax liabilities of their employees where such income tax and USC liabilities arise from the schemes.<\/p><p>Data Revenue have now released on the preliminary 2020 end of year statements which shows that almost half of those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) or TWSS in 2020 have no outstanding liability to discharge (in fact over a third are due a refund).<\/p><p>In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicates that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000.  <\/p><p>If paid over the 4 year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week. These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.  <\/p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The EWSS has re-established the normal requirement to operate PAYE on all employee salaries, providing for the regular deduction and remittance of income tax, USC and employee PRSI. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax","counter":464,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG07600"},{"type":"question","counter":465,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[8530\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700064#WRG07700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if local property tax will be reduced for apartment owners who pay large service charges to their management companies but receive no direct services from their local authority; if the tax will also be reduced in cases in which the property has been for sale for a lengthy period of time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":466,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government &quot;Our Shared Future&quot; includes the following commitments in relation to LPT- <\/p><p>a.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were impacted by COVID-19 on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the particular issue of extending the period of a mortgage approval in principle, the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an approval in principle. That is a commercial and business matter for individual lenders.  However, a lender should make the duration of any offer of approval in principle clear to a consumer, in line with the requirement of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 to provide clear information to a consumer and bring their attention to key information.<\/p>  <p>  More generally there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700065#WRH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Incentives","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700065#WRH03600"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[8866\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700065#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has considered implementing a tax incentive scheme on gym memberships or exercise classes when Covid-19 restrictions are lifted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>Taxation based measures are matters for consideration in the context of my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines and the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.

One of the benefits envisaged from the scheme was indeed that more people cycling to and from work would improve health and fitness levels.  Further, Finance Act 2018 commenced the Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare facilities and Fitness Centres.

However, the OPW has budgeted and allocated the required funding to progress these schemes (approximately &euro;31 million   euro) as part of its multi-annual budgeting of almost EUR1bn out to 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[8202\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Office of Public Works will open consultation or hold an online briefing with residents affected by the construction of new flood defences on both the east side and the west side of the River Shannon in Athlone, County Westmeath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[8203\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Office of Public Works will provide a timeline for completion of the flood defence projects on the east and west sides of the River Shannon in Athlone, County Westmeath.","asker":"1495","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.<\/p><p>The Athlone Flood Relief Scheme is being led by Westmeath County Council with funding from the Office of Public Works (OPW).

In the first tranche, Ireland has been allocated approximately &euro;84 million (2018 prices). The second tranche makes up 30% of the total funding allocation and the allocation method will be based on economic data available in October 2021. <\/p><p>With regard to how REACT-EU can be utilised, maximum flexibility is being given to Member States to utilise the additional funding under their existing European Social Fund, European Regional Development Fund, and Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived programmes, with an option to avail of up to 100% EU co-financing.The relevant national authorities in Ireland are currently engaged in a process to finalise the arrangements to allocate this funding between the eligible Funds and Programmes. <\/p><p>In relation to 2021-2027Ireland is expected to receive a total of &euro;1,137 million (in 2018 prices) in Cohesion Policy Funds, comprising of:<\/p><p>- &euro;351 million for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF);<\/p><p>-  &euro;451 million for the European Social Fund + (ESF+);<\/p><p>-  &euro;258 million for European Territorial Cooperation (including PEACE PLUS); and<\/p><p>-  &euro;77 million under the Just Transition Fund (JTF).<\/p><p>The details supplied to date indicate an initial ERDF allocation for the transition region &ndash; the Northern and Western Region of &euro;97,811,529 with the remaining &euro;253,296,072 allocated across the two more developed Regions &ndash; the Southern Region and the Midland and Eastern Region.

I have acknowledged that the Northern and Western region of Ireland has been designated as a 'Region in Transition'. In light of this, I announced in October 2020 that there would be a specific ERDF programme focused on the North West and that the Northern Western Regional Assembly will act as Managing Authority for the programme for the 2021-27 period.  Moreover, an independent Needs Analysis was conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants to provide the evidence base for the future ERDF (and ESF+) programmes. The report includes a specific analysis of regional disparities and the particular challenges faced by each region. Given the reclassification of the Northern and Western region, a specific chapter is dedicated to the past performance and the particular needs of this region. In developing the Operational Programmes, consideration will be given to how best we can avail of the flexibilities available in the regulations, how to maximise synergies between the various EU Funds and how the overall process can help to address the specific needs of all regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[8897\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the contracts for public relations advice and consultancy entered into by his Department costing more than &euro;10,000 since January 2021; the nature of the contract; and the length of the contract, in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has not entered into any contracts for public relations advice or consultancy in the period specified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Communications","counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[8917\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if there has been any contact with his counterpart in the United States.","asker":"1514","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question there has not been any contact with my counterpart in the United States administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ04000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[8683\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700066#WRJ04000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will engage with an organisation (details supplied) in advance of the 5 March 2021 review of Covid-19 restrictions.","asker":"1454","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>Correspondence has been received from the organisation concerned and the matters raised therein are being considered with a view to the issue of a response at the earliest possible date. <\/p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have had extensive engagement with the long-established representative body for the businesses in question.

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.  The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service. <\/p><p>The sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue.  I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces.<\/p><p>Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have engaged in meeting key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  Work is continuing to explore the issues arising, with a follow up meeting between my officials and the NUJ taking place on 3<sup>rd<\/sup>February and a further meeting with Local Ireland has been scheduled for Wednesday 17 February.In addition, the Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers. <\/p><p>Funding for local radio stations is provided through the Sound and Vision Scheme. This is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence.  It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  There is no equivalent statutory scheme for the print sector and the BAI has no function in funding the print sector.  On 27 January 2021 the BAI announced another &euro;6.9m in supports which included &euro;1.4m allocated by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to the BAI Broadcasting Fund in December 2020 for live music projects.  This will assist in providing a platform for music industry professionals who would have predominately worked in the live music sector which has been severely impacted by Covid-19.  It will allow for projects that will help musicians to connect with audiences through Television and Radio. A further round of &euro;2.5m was announced recently for the independent radio sector and further rounds will follow later in year and the BAI will announce these as they arise. This funding is on top of the supports already put in place in 2020.

The Commission is currently in the process of engaging with key stakeholders in a series of thematic dialogues.

The support will allow each local authority to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities.  The new scheme will take account of public health guidelines and of the needs of local arts and entertainment communities. Ideally projects will respond to the challenges associated with COVID-19 and support the recovery of the creative, cultural, entertainment and events sector as well as being future-proofed from a health and safety perspective.  <\/p><p>The Public Spending Code requires cost benefits analyses to be completed for projects over &euro;20m and as this scheme will not reach that threshold, such an analyses was not therefore required.The scheme is designed to deliver speedy results in order to support live performances as soon as it is safe to do so, and within any potential future restrictions on outdoor events.<\/p><p>Funding for the scheme will be delivered from within existing resources of the Department.It will not come from the allocation of &euro;50 million made in Budget 2021 for the live performance sector.  It is however part of a comprehensive suite of measures to support the cultural sector in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on the sector. It is also designed to align with similar schemes being developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to address infrastructure for outdoor dining. These initiatives have significant potential to enhance the public realm in local authority areas. They link to the wider work of the Night Time Economy Taskforce and will potentially contribute to the longer term regeneration of cities and towns across the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700067#WRK06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[8639\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700067#WRK06400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the breakdown of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland adaption grant; the number of applicants that applied by county; the number of grants that were successfully processed; the number that were declined; the number that are still outstanding pending further information; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Adaptation Fund for tourism businesses is administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I have referred the Deputy's question to them for direct reply.

It is worth noting however that non-domestic customers of Irish Water, including sports centres, currently face charges for water services based on their actual metered consumption and in line with a charging policy determined by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities. This is in keeping with Ireland's obligations under the Water Framework Directive. It is understood that some sports organisations may already have arrangements in place to capture and store rainwater for use for purposes (such as watering green areas) which do not require potable water. By doing so they are conserving the use of treated water and reducing their water bills.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700068#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700068#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[7851\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700068#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the referendum on the right to housing will be held in accordance with the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>The commitments in relation to Constitutional reform in the Programme for Government provide for the holding of a referendum on housing. <\/p><p>My Department has begun the work of scoping what such a referendum might involve.

The range of objectives and actions it specifies have been pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock. The key drivers of these actions are: local authorities, the Housing Agency, and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by schemes available within my Department specifically designed to tackle vacancy, such as the Repair and Lease Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme and the Long Term Leasing Scheme.<\/p><p>- The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties. The scheme provides upfront funding to carry out the works and, in return, the property owner agrees to lease the dwelling to the local authority to be used as social housing for a period up to 25 years. The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Leases scheme has been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. The number of dwellings delivered under the Repair &amp;amp; Lease scheme from July 2018 to end Q3 2020 is 167 dwellings. <\/p><p>-  The Buy and Renew initiative allows local authorities to purchase private vacant properties for use as social housing. The number of units purchased by local authorities under the Buy and Renew scheme from July 2018 to end of 2020 was 419 units.<\/p><p>- The Housing Acquisitions Fund is a &euro;70 million revolving that was established in January 2017 with the objective of enabling the Housing Agency to acquire vacant units from banks and investment companies for social housing use.  The fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the AHB sector and the funds received are then recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. Since July 2018, a total of 436 properties had been purchased by the Housing Agency using the Fund and placed on caretaker leases with AHBs. <\/p><p>Table 1 below gives a breakdown of the number of

Consideration of this matter is important in ensuring that local authority elected Councils are fully representative of the constituents they serve.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there is no expenditure category for childcare or other caring costs incurred by councillors while attending meetings. This was an issue raised in the consultation process as part of the Independent Review of the Role and Remuneration of Local Authority Elected Members, led by Ms Sara Moorhead SC and published in June 2020. The expenditure categories for vouched expenses of councillors are aligned with those available under the Public Representation Allowance (PRA) for Oireachtas members. Oireachtas members cannot claim for childcare costs, though there is a privately operated fee-paying cr&egrave;che facility available for Oireachtas members and staff.<\/p>  <p>  Tailored allowances for caring costs are not available to other office holders in the State nor are they available for local authority employees who service council meetings.<\/p>  <p>  In her report, Ms Moorhead did suggest that the extension of the allowable expenses to include caring costs incurred by councillors in attending Council meetings could in theory be considered. However, she acknowledged that such a proposal would be out of line with practice for other office holders and state employees, and so advised that this should be considered with a good degree of caution.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs introduced a universal childcare subsidy from August 2017, which is available to all children in Tusla-registered childcare above the age of 6 months.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a cr&egrave;che on site in Dublin City Council Civic Offices on Wood Quay which is also adjacent to City Hall. Preference is given to staff and Councillors although it is open to others depending on demand.  Councillors have availed of the cr&egrave;che on either a full time or part-time basis, and can reserve places for Committee meetings which all take place during the working day. The fees are not subsidised for Councillors or staff.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a parenting room in City Hall where councillors can feed or change young children. Dublin City Council has a parenting policy which permits Councillors to bring babies and children to meetings as long as they are supervised by their parents.

In general building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.<\/p><p>In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and\/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.<\/p><p>The design and construction of buildings is regulated under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020. The Acts provides for the making of Building Regulations and Building Control Regulations.<\/p><p>The Building Regulations 1997 - 2019 set out the legal requirements in Ireland for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings. Their aim is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. <\/p><p>The Building Control Regulations set out the administrative procedures for demonstrating compliance in respect of an individual building or works.<\/p><p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020 primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.<\/p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities which have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under statute.<\/p><p>In addition local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of building defects and provides for an examination of defective housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing report, &quot;Safe as Houses&quot;.<\/p><p>In this regard, my Department is actively engaging with key stakeholders and I have had several meetings with stakeholder representative groups on this matter over recent months. My Department is currently working to establish the structures to examine the issue of defective housing, this will include apartment buildings, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>I recently appointed Mr Seamus Neely, former Chief Executive of Donegal County Council, to the position of Chair to the independent working group to oversee the effective implementation of the group&rsquo;s terms of reference which are currently being finalised.<\/p><p>In addition, I brought a Memorandum for the Information of the Government to Cabinet recently to note the establishment of a working group with the appropriate expertise to examine the issue of defective housing. It is intended to hold the inaugural plenary working group meeting shortly.<\/p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others.<\/p><p>In the context of fire safety, when a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the owner management company.<\/p><p>Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which is under the remit of the Minister for Justice, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.<\/p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements have arisen, the Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published in 2017. It is intended to be used as a guide for the owners and occupants of dwellings (houses and apartments) where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern, to develop strategies to improve fire safety and to develop strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available at the following link: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Separately, the ongoing building control reform agenda, with its many initiatives, already provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry. The reform agenda includes:<\/p><p>- Amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;<\/p><p>- Establishment of the National Building Control Office; and<\/p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.<\/p><p>Now, if\/when issues arise whether pre, during or post construction, it is clear who has held the designated roles and who is responsible for addressing the issues.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.<\/p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner \/ co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.

The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers working in the sector, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports.  These include provisions whereby a household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to entitlement to a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) package, in order to qualify for HAP, a household must be qualified for social housing support by their local authority, which means the household must qualify to go on the local authority housing waiting list. HAP tenants find their own accommodation in the private rented market and are advised that this accommodation should be within the HAP rent limits provided to them by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance document outlines that victims of domestic violence that had been in a joint local authority tenancy can be eligible for re-entry to the waiting list where a deed of separation is in place. Where such a deed does not exist housing authorities may use discretion to allow applications, the guidance document does not address whether the spouse should remain at home while the victim has been forced to leave. <\/p>  <p>  A housing authority may also provide short-term emergency housing to persons who are unable to return to their homes because of domestic violence on a humanitarian basis without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s waiting list for housing supports.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance was introduced with the objective of supporting a partnership approach by statutory agencies in respect of the delivery of domestic violence services, particularly in relation to helping to prevent and reduce the occurrence of related homelessness and facilitating the provision of long term accommodation for victims of domestic violence. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides that a local authority tenant can apply to the District Court for an excluding order against a person, including a joint tenant, who is engaging in anti-social behaviour.  A housing authority may also apply for the excluding order where it believes that the tenant is deterred or prevented by violence, threat or fear, either to himself or herself or to persons associated with him or her, from pursuing an application for an excluding order.  Anti-social behaviour for this purpose is defined to include any behaviour which causes or is likely to cause any significant or persistent danger, injury, damage, alarm, loss or fear to any person in the house, including violence, threats, intimidation, coercion, harassment or serious obstruction of any person and behaviour which causes any significant or persistent impairment of a person&rsquo;s use or enjoyment of his\/her home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700070#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":786,"content":"<p>Question No. 290 answered with Question No. 253.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teagasc na Gaeilge","counter":787,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700070#WRN01425"},{"type":"question","counter":788,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[8540\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700070#WRN01450","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"c&eacute; na comhairl&iacute; condae agus cathrach at&aacute; ag cur ranganna Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il d&aacute; bhfoireann agus c&eacute; acu nach bhfuil ag d&eacute;anamh amhlaidh; agus an gcreideann s&eacute; gur cheart go mbeadh ranganna Gaeilge &aacute; gcur ar f&aacute;il don fhoireann ag comhairl&iacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;la uile an St&aacute;it.","asker":"1579","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":789,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l an t-eolas seo ar f&aacute;il i mo Roinn.

On 22 December 2020, Government approved the priority drafting of the Affordable Housing Bill 2020, the General Scheme of which I published on 20 January last.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to underpin three schemes which will prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes delivered by local authorities utilising the Serviced Sites Fund,  (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase by local authorities is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  To support the delivery of these, &euro;310 million is made available under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority lands. With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated under the fund.  To date, Serviced Sites Funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of approximately 4,000 affordable homes.<\/p>  <p>  All SSF proposals are considered on the basis of economic analyses submitted by local authorities. These are undertaken to confirm affordability challenges in a given area, project viability, and the local authority's ability to deliver affordable homes with at least a 10% discount on open market values.  To date, economic assessments of Cavan and Monaghan have not provided a basis for SSF applications.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme announced in Budget 2021 (for private developments), provisions for this measure formed part of the Affordable Housing Bill.

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700071#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700071#WRO03200"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[8981\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700071#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he received a request from Dublin City Council to meet with councillors of the south east area committee in respect of a motion passed regarding the development of a site (details supplied); and if he will meet with the councillors of that area committee in addition to relevant officials from Dublin City Council to discuss the development.","asker":"1551","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":865,"content":"<p>I have received a meeting request from Dublin City Council this week and will be writing back to the Council on the matter.<\/p><p>The regeneration of Poolbeg West is the next important step in transforming the Docklands area, given its strategic location east of Grand Canal Dock, with close proximity to important bridge connections to Dublin Port and North Lotts. <\/p><p>In relation to the activation of these lands i understand that, having decided to embark on the competitive tendering process, on 22 December 2020, the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) announced the completion of a comprehensive process to select an investment partner for the development of this site within Poolbeg West Strategic Development Zone. <\/p><p>Furthermore, NAMA has named the successful bidder as a consortium consisting of Ronan Group Real Estate, funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.

The new Regulation represents a significant development in the EU sanctions regime. For the first time, the EU is equipping itself with a framework that will allow it to target individuals, entities and bodies &ndash; including state and non-state actors &ndash; responsible for, involved in or associated with serious human rights violations and abuses worldwide, no matter where they occurred. This global regime will coexist with country-specific sanctions regimes &ndash; such as those against Belarus and Russia. <\/p><p>  The framework for targeted restrictive measures applies to acts such as genocide, crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations or abuses (including torture, slavery, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests or detentions). Other human rights violations or abuses can also fall under the scope of the sanctions regime where those violations or abuses are widespread, systematic or are otherwise of serious concern as regards the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU.  It will be for the Council, acting upon a proposal from a Member State or from the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to establish, review and amend the sanctions list.<\/p><p>  The direct implications for Ireland are that we will be obliged to implement sanctions as listings are decided within the framework of the regime. The regime will target individuals and entities and may involve the imposition of travel bans and the freezing of assets\/funds, which may be located in Ireland. Ireland may also be called on to grant humanitarian derogations under the regime, which confers this function upon Member States&rsquo; competent authorities.<\/p><p>  Ireland is extremely supportive of the new regime and believes it will be a useful addition to the EU&rsquo;s human rights toolbox. .

The Code of Behaviour must also set out any measures that the school may take when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards of behaviour and the procedures to be followed, including those relating to the investigation of any alleged breach of the code.  <\/p><p>In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent\/guardian is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parent\/guardian must be referred, as appropriate to the schools complaint procedures.  <\/p><p>Under the Education Act 1998 the school Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.  Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, it does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases.  This Department's role is to clarify for parents\/guardians and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. My Department does not comment on individual cases.<\/p><p>Where there is cause for complaint matters would normally be addressed by the parent(s) \/guardian(s) to the individual teacher or school Principal as appropriate.  If matters cannot be resolved at that level then a complaint can be addressed to the Chairperson of the school's Board of Management.  <\/p><p>Where a person is of the view that a school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should bring the matter to the attention of the Patron.  In the event that, after raising its concerns with the school patron, a parent\/guardian still considers that the matter has not been resolved, it is open to the parent\/guardian to raise the matter with the Ombudsman for Children. <\/p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised by the Department of Education, provided the parent\/guardian has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions or non-actions of a school has, or, may have, adversely affected the child.  The office can be contacted at: Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1; tel. 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 865 6800 or email oco@oco.ie. <\/p><p>Information on Complaints procedures can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>www.education.ie\/en\/Parents\/Information\/Complaints-Bullying-Child-Protection-Discrimination\/.<\/i><\/p><p>Children First National Guidance and the Anti Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools provide that where serious instances of bullying are regarded as possibly abusive it may be necessary to make a referral to Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as appropriate.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005: <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation;<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs;<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools;<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing;<\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards;<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act;<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council; and <\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.<\/p><p>The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to:<\/p><p>-  an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs;<\/p><p>-  consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP);<\/p><p>-  the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan; and<\/p><p>-  an independent appeals process.<\/p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021, the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1\/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.<\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017.<\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.<\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.<\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives.<\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child. This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.

The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1\/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:<\/p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. <\/p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700075#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":1140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700075#WRU03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1141,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[8450\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700075#WRU04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated amount her Department has spent on legal costs arising from litigation involving children with special educational needs; the details of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1142,"content":"<p>It should be noted by the Deputy that my Department does not initiate such proceedings and cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government's authority to decide issues of education policy is in question.

It is a school-based service with an overall objective of providing an educational psychology service to all schools, through the application of psychological theory and practice, to support the wellbeing, and academic, social and emotional development of all learners.  NEPS prioritises support for learners at risk of educational disadvantage and those with special educational needs.  <\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  This model does not operate on a waiting lists basis.  The NEPS Model of Service is one where there is a balance between consultation and casework about individual children, and support and development work with school personnel. This model is based on what the research shows is effective in the application of psychology and facilitates a number of ways for psychologists to engage with schools. The needs of children and young people are met most effectively where parents, teachers and psychologist work collaboratively, consulting with each other with regard to the issue or concern. Other agencies and other staff in the school may also be involved.  This could for example include a special education teacher, SNA or personnel from the NCSE.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS encourages and supports schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700076#WRV02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700076#WRV02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1193,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[8584\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700076#WRV02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a tender process for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1514","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1194,"content":"<p>The building project referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme. <\/p><p>The tender process to establish a new Design &amp;amp; Build Contractors Framework commenced on the 4th December 2019.

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. <\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work with schools. Individual casework involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child\/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s SET team or Student Support Team feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can identify the most appropriate referral pathway and supports school with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care\/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to casework NEPS psychologists work with teachers to build their capacity.  NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  <\/p>  <p>  A student support team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the development of Student Support Teams to coordinate supports and develop a whole-school approach to wellbeing promotion.  NEPS also provides advice in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. <\/p>  <p>  Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020\/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700076#WRV05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700076#WRV05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1226,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[8770\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700076#WRV05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the development of a new school building for two schools (details supplied); the reason the process has been delayed; if progress has been made in relation to car parking solutions on the site; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1227,"content":"<p>The joint building project for the two schools referred to by the Deputy is included in my Department&rsquo;s Construction Programme which is being delivered under the National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  This project is currently at an early stage of Architectural Planning, Stage 1 &ndash; Assessment of Site, Site Investigations and Initial Sketch Scheme.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; InterpretationSection 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational NeedsSection 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schoolsSections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health BoardsSections 40 to 53 - amending the Education ActSchedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the CouncilSchedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; <\/p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).<\/p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.<\/p><p>- an independent appeals process.<\/p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. <\/p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1\/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:<\/p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. <\/p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700076#WRV07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1247,"content":"<p>Question Nos. 457 to 460, inclusive, answered with Question No. 454.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":1248,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1249,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[8821\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount her Department has spent on legal costs arising from litigation involving children with special educational needs in each year since 2004.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1250,"content":"<p>It should be noted by the Deputy that my Department does not initiate such proceedings and cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government's authority to decide issues of education policy is in question.

The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p>  <p>  Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p>  <p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p>  <p>  Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p>  <p>  This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:<\/p>  <p>  Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. <\/p>  <p>  Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p>  <p>  It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1267,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[8959\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress made in the past six months to provide new accommodation for a school (details supplied) in view of the poor accommodation in the school at present; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1268,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, a building project to provide improved accommodation for the schools in question is included on the Department's school building programme to be delivered as part of the National Development Plan (NDP). <\/p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is liaising with the schools regarding the accommodation brief for the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":1270,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":1269,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1270,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[8764\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700077#WRW02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she has considered extending the benefits under the PRSI system to include counselling and psychotherapy.","asker":"1469","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1271,"content":"<p>Payment of Treatment Benefit is provided for under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.

Last November,   I secured Government approval to extend the 2020 earnings reference period for employees to September 2020.  This change, which is effective from 2 October, meant that people who only commenced employment after February 2020 but were laid-off in October due to increased restrictions can have their payment rate fixed by reference to their earnings in the period March to September 2020.  <\/p>  <p>   As a result of extending the reference period to the end of September 2020, some 37,430 receiving PUP on 17 November received an increase in their rate of payment. <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that a significant number of those who benefitted from the extended reference period will be due arrears, either to the 2 October or the date of commencement of their claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, whichever is the later.<\/p>  <p>  During the months of November and December, a number of very significant IT changes were in progress in relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. These included the finalisation of the general arrears project involving 286,000 additional payments on 1 December, payment of the Christmas Bonus on 8 December to just over 283,000 recipients of the PUP, and advance payments over the Christmas period. My Department has also been focused on responding to the increased numbers of people applying for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, with an increase of over 200,000 claims in payment since the start of this year. Against that background, and in order to ensure continuity of service delivery, it was not possible to introduce the necessary IT changes to allow for processing of any re-rate arrears which may have arisen. <\/p>  <p>  The necessary IT development work to ensure processing of any of these arrears has progressed significantly in recent weeks and it is expected that payment will issue shortly.

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.   <\/p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of December 2020, there were 88,906 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2021 is approximately &euro;953 million. <\/p>  <p>  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  <\/p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week (as per Budget 2021 this will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021).   For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the additional cost outlined by the Deputy, as there are too many variables, not least the number of people earning the average industrial income who would potentially also meet the criteria of providing full-time care and would become eligible if the disregard was increased and whether they would be assessed as a single person or a couple.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that under the current means assessment there are scenarios where those in receipt of average weekly earnings of &euro;811.58 (or annual income of &euro;42,202.16), as outlined, would qualify for the payment of Carer's Allowance.  For example in the case of a carer whose partner has weekly earnings of &euro;811.58 they may qualify for a weekly payment of &euro;174.00 (almost 80% of the full rate).  If they have qualified children, the payment will be higher.<\/p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  It should be noted that some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.

This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  A Public Service pension is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.  Qualifying payments for those aged 66 or over include State Pension (Contributory or Non-Contributory), Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (Contributory), Deserted Wives Benefit, Incapacity Supplement under the Disablement Pension Scheme, Death Benefit Pension under Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme as well as certain social security payments from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.   All other qualifying conditions must also be satisfied to receive the payment. <\/p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase is a &euro;19 increase in the weekly rate of payment of certain Irish social protection payments, awarded where the recipient is living alone.  For those aged 66 or over,  payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory) , Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension,  Widow's\/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  It is not a stand-alone payment.  There are no circumstances where the living alone increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to allow former Public Servants who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the fuel allowance or the living alone increase would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full time care. It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care for.  S\/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s\/he cares for more than one person. <\/p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet from their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700078#WRX06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1377,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[8671\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700078#WRX06900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will examine the eligibility of a person (details supplied) to an interim payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1378,"content":"<p>Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds is a payment for people aged 65 who have ceased employment or self-employment and who satisfy the pay-related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. <\/p><p>To qualify, a customer must have paid at least 104 PRSI insurable employment contributions at Class A , H or P <\/p><p>OR<\/p><p>have paid at least 156 PRSI self-employment contributions at Class S<\/p><p>AND<\/p><p>have paid at least 39 PRSI contributions at Class A, H or P or have credited contributions in the governing contribution year.<\/p><p>The Governing Contribution Year is the second last complete tax year; for example, for a claim in 2021 the second last complete tax year in 2019.<\/p><p>A self-employed customer must have paid at least 156 PRSI self-employment contributions at Class S<\/p><p>OR<\/p><p>have paid at least 104 PRSI insurable employment contributions at Class A or H<\/p><p>AND<\/p><p>have paid 52 PRSI self-employment contributions at Class S in the governing contribution year.<\/p><p>The Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds may be paid from the date of a person's 65th birthday until the date of their 66th birthday as long as they continue to satisfy the conditions for this payment.<\/p><p>It does not appear as if the person  concerned qualifies under the PRSI conditions but I would suggest that she lodge an application and a formal decision will be given to her. <\/p><p>The quickest way to apply for the Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds is by making an application through MyWelfare.ie .

The provision of an onsite foodhall was crucial to the bid from all successful tenderers and would have been factored into their costs.  Tenders were evaluated on the Most Economically Advantageous Tender model, whereby bids are assessed on a combination of the quality of the proposal of service delivery and price. Quality of the proposal of service delivery was 60% of overall marks while price was 40%.<\/p>  <p>  It would undermine the integrity of the procurement process if bidders were asked (either individually or collectively) to change the service delivery model from that contained in the specifications following assessment and contract award and would leave the process open to legal challenges from any unsuccessful bidders who could claim that they may have been successful had they been allowed to submit bids based on a voucher system or other proposal rather than a foodhall.<\/p>  <p>  Port Road, Letterkenny will be the 30th accommodation centre to come through the tendering process.

Given the sensitivity of these deeply personal issues, it was accepted that a bespoke approach was necessary to facilitate and protect individuals who wished to engage confidentially with this module of the Commission&rsquo;s work.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge therefore the reported procedural distinctions in the methodologies employed by the Commission across the different modules of its inquiry process &ndash; not all testimony was sworn evidence gathered or processed in accordance with the full rigours of the Commissions of Investigation Act. This does not in any way alter the value or truth of the stories captured in the Confidential Committee part of the Final Report, but it is important to acknowledge the different procedures implemented by the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission is independent in the conduct of its inquiries and I had no role in, or knowledge of, the particulars of its approach. In its Final Report, the Commission states that &ldquo;Witnesses were asked for permission to record their evidence on the clear understanding that the recordings would be used only as an aide memoire for the researcher when compiling the report and would then be destroyed.  All such recordings were destroyed after the report was added to the Confidential Committee electronic repository of information.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the Commission&rsquo;s position is that the decision not to retain these recordings was legitimately and legally taken by it to ensure the anonymity it had promised. My Department's understanding is that recordings were made as an aid to the work of the Confidential Committee and that the above reference includes contemporaneous notes taken by the note taker at the same time and used to create the records retained for the Confidential Committee and used in preparing the final report.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2020, the Oireachtas enacted the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020 to protect and preserve the Commission&rsquo;s records. This legislation prevented the redaction of personal information so that the records can be made available to those seeking access to their personal information.<\/p>  <p>  The only exception to the above requirement was to facilitate persons who voluntarily met the Confidential Committee to decide to have their name and contact details redacted so as to protect their anonymity.  Most importantly, no such anonymity applies to the sworn testimony given before the Commission itself.

In the context of these preparations, I sought further information from the Chair of the Commission to clarify whether it may be technically possible to recover any recordings or notes made by the Confidential Committee.  In its response, the Commission yesterday clarified that its advice from IT experts is that it is not technically possible to recover the audio recordings.

These are Carroll Village in Dundalk, Setanta Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast in Ardee and the Carnbeg Hotel in Dundalk.<\/p>  <p>  Carroll Village, is a dedicated international protection accommodation centre that was initially contracted in 2005 on an annual basis with contract renewal every January since.  My Department has a contract for accommodation services in 23 apartments in the Carroll Village complex and we are currently in discussions with the provider for continued use of these apartments for 2021.   The remaining apartments in the complex are not contracted to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Self-catering accommodation provided by my Department normally provides an on-site shop or foodhall where residents may obtain food and household items free of charge under a points based system.  This facility is a contractual requirement for contractors for such accommodation centres.  In addition, a weekly allowance of &euro;38.80 per week for adults and &euro;29.80 per week for children is paid by Community Welfare Officers (CWO).  This allowance is a cash supplement for incidental expenses. <\/p>  <p>  However, Carroll Village was chosen as a pilot project to provide self-catering facilities with weekly payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to cover the normal day to day living costs associated with living independently.

Everyone has a role to play in preparing young people to reach their developmental milestones. <\/p>  <p>  Legislative provision for aftercare has been strengthened by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, which imposed a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person, following an assessment of need. In response to the new legislative provision, Tusla has developed a suite of policies and guidance documents for aftercare support, which includes guidance on direct financial support. <\/p>  <p>  The most prominent form of such support is the aftercare allowance, which is provided to cover a young person&rsquo;s day to day costs as they progress in education or accredited training. The core age range for eligibility for aftercare is 18 to 21 years of age. Specific legislative provision is in place for aftercare to continue until a young person is 23 years of age where they are finishing a course of education. For those young adults who are not in education \/ training at 18 years, aftercare services support them in accessing any relevant financial allowances and support to which they may be entitled from the Department of Social Protection or other agencies.

This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This funding is enabling institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors and Assistant Psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs in 2020 setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which I launched last year.<\/p>  <p>  This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  The Framework provides very clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties. The HEA has partnered with the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention and Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland (PCHEI) in providing training in a specialist suicide assessment and management approach. Over 300 psychologists and counsellors across 26 higher education institutions are currently undertaking Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality training, a first in world at this scale across a sector.  The CAMS approach is supported by over 70 studies and given the origins of its development was a university mental health setting, it fits well in a higher education context.  This is further support for student counselling services to meet the complex and challenging needs that present on campuses at an increasing rate in the past number of years.  This also addresses Goal 5 in the Department of Health&rsquo;s Connecting for Life &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020: \"To ensure safe and high-quality services for people vulnerable to suicide.\"  Together with the crisis text line 50808 that I launched in October 2020, I'm confident that capacity to respond to students experiencing high distress and mental health difficulties has been significantly improved over the past 6 months. <\/p>  <p>  Funding has also helped develop the student counselling services across the Higher Education sector in many ways besides student counsellor resourcing. For example, some institutions have developed new roles of Assistant Psychologist, Student Support Officer and Mental Health Advisors for student mental health supports.

The national co-ordination group for further and higher education is also meeting on a regular basis, and is closely monitoring the impact that Covid-19 is having on third level institutions and their students.<\/p>  <p>  From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:<\/p>  <p>  - teaching and learning, <\/p>  <p>  - assessment, and <\/p>  <p>  - qualifications. <\/p>  <p>  This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).<\/p>  <p>  The government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business and Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021, Plan for Living with COVID-19, combined with the HSA Return to Work Protocols and ongoing Public Health advice, provide the over-arching framework for all sectors of society for the operation of their facilities and premises in keeping with public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Specific to further and higher education, the government has also published &ldquo;Guidance for Further and Higher Education for returning to on-site activity in 2020: Roadmap and COVID-19 Adaptation Framework for returning to on-site activity in autumn 2020&rdquo; accompanied by &ldquo;Implementation Guidelines for Public Health Measures in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)&rdquo; and outbreaks protocols developed in collaboration with experts within the higher education sector and with the Department of Health.

The provision of Higher Education funding on an annual basis is part of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy for Government.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Government provides financial support to the higher education sector through direct through recurrent grants, and indirectly through a number of specific parameters including free fees, policy initiatives, Springboard, Human Capital Initiative, SUSI fee supports.  <\/p>  <p>  The student contribution, as paid annually by undergraduate students not in receipt of SUSI grants, is another element of the total resources available to the higher education sector. Other income available to the institutions includes fees collected from tuition fees, part-time courses, postgraduate course fees and other onsite\/offsite commercial activities. My Department does not have oversight of these funding arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2015 there has been a significant programme of re-investment in higher education. Funding and policy developments taken in recent Budgets have taken significant steps to address the funding needs of the sector.  Most notably, and in line with the recommendation of the Cassells report, a new stream of employer funding was introduced upon a review of the National Training Fund. This level of investment responded to demographic pressures and underpinned a range of initiatives in the higher education sector, including a new research initiative, a substantial investment in the evolution of Technological Universities,  significant skills-enhancing opportunities for individuals, sectors and regions most vulnerable to Brexit as well as updating skills more generally to prepare Ireland&rsquo;s society and economy for a future world of work transformed by technology and automation.<\/p>  <p>  Government funding demonstrably increased in the period 2016 to 2020 with increased planned investment in Higher Education, an increase of 25% compared to 2016 &ndash; an amount in the order of an additional &euro;370 million bringing the total funding for the sector in 2020 to &euro;1.87 billion pre-Covid (up from &euro;1.5 billion in 2016). This represented the restoration of the peak level of expenditure on higher education achieved in 2008.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, in line with the two distinct policy goals that will need to be addressed in budgetary decisions over the medium term, additional funding had been provided for the core budgetary programmes and funding for Covid-19 related policy responses. Exclusive of research provision the total planned Departmental and NTF funding of the HE sector for 2021 is in the order of &euro;1.98billion.<\/p>  <p>  This includes:<\/p>  <p>  - Recurrent Grant and Free Fees Funding of over &euro;1.06 billion.<\/p>  <p>  - National Training Fund Enterprise Focused, Apprenticeship, Springboard and HCI investment of over &euro;305million.<\/p>  <p>  - Student support and related expenses provision of over &euro;400million.<\/p>  <p>  Through Budget 2021 funding will be provided to meet demographic and other pressures across the sectors, including Covid-19 impacts, and to provide for additional upskilling and reskilling opportunities, as well as increased capacity and places in the higher education sector. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of Government funding the immediate matter to consider is that the delivery of further and higher education in the context of Covid-19 will cost the providers more not less. In 2020 the Government has provided funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education. A further &euro;47.5m is also being provided in 2020 to provide additional skills courses as part of the July stimulus programme. The Government has also made available once off funding to provide financial assistance in academic year 2020\/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the significant additional funding already committed is delivering real benefits on the ground.  However there is always a need to look to the future.  This is why I am progressing the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education.  This is essential in light of the centrality of higher education - both in terms of human capital development, research and innovation - to underpinning the future development of Ireland as a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, the future funding needs of the sector are currently under further review through the Departments engagement with the European Commission\/DG Reform. The review is a comprehensive economic evaluation of the various funding options presented in the Cassells Expert Group Report and is being undertaken by an expert independent international consortium of consultants including Indecon and LE Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Department officials are working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consortia of consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options. This review commenced in early 2020 and work is expected to be complete towards the latter part of Q2 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Department officials will continue to work with stakeholders on this comprehensive analysis of funding options for higher education and the assessment of the appropriate balance in provision across the tertiary education system. <\/p>  <p>  Completion of this work will allow for an informed debate on the appropriate policy approach to future planning and funding of higher and further education provision which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  All of the foregoing highlights my commitment and that of Government to support students and learners in accessing and successfully participating in both higher and further <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700081#WRAA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Provision","counter":1572,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700081#WRAA04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1573,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[8462\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700081#WRAA05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the breakdown between expenditure on training for those seeking employment and in employment training; the way in which apprenticeships are categorised; the percentage spent on funding apprenticeships; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1574,"content":"<p>The National Training Fund (NTF) was established by the National Training Fund Act, 2000 to raise the skills of those in employment, provide training to those who wish to acquire skills for the purposes of taking up employment, and provide information in relation to existing, or likely future, requirements for skills in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 NTF allocation of &euro;741.2m will provide &euro;299.8m (40.5%) for programmes for those in employment and &euro;438.2m (59.1%) for programmes relating to skills acquisition for the purposes for taking up employment.   &euro;3.2m (0.4%) is provided for the provision of information on skills requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for the apprenticeship programme is provided for in the programmes for those in employment.

As the Deputy notes, the Northern and Western Region is being categorised as a transition region and will attract a higher ESF cofinancing rate of 60% while the other regions will be cofinanced at 40%.<\/p>  <p>While the 2014-2020 ESF Programme had indicative allocations by NUTS 2 Region, the Programme has been amended on a number of occasions, most recently to avail of the additional flexibilities, delivered through two Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII and CRII+) packages, in which Member States could re-programme existing allocations of funding towards the Covid 19 response, at a co-financing rate of 100%.  &euro;60m ESF funding was reallocated to the ERDF to support the  purchase of PPE for the Health Services and we will be drawing down the full ESF\/YEI allocations on fewer programmed activities.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2020, the share of BMW expenditure declared in payment applications to the European Commission accounted for 17% of the total expenditure declared.  It should be noted that expenditure in the BMW region was only reported with effect from 2016 as the earlier 2007-2013 ESF Programme ran for a further 2 years in the BMW than in the other regions. <\/p>  <p>In relation to 2021-2027   Ireland is expected to receive &euro;451m for the European Social Fund+ (ESF+) with an initial ESF+ allocation for the transition region &ndash; the Northern and Western Region of &euro;125,659,754 with the remaining &euro;325,412,787 allocated across the two more developed Regions. However, the Regulations governing the funds, which are nearing finalisation, provide for a number of flexibilities, including transferring allocations between Funds and Regions.   The final allocation between programmes and regions will be determined in the context of discussions with the European Commission on the Partnership Agreement covering all Common Provisions Regulation funds.  <\/p>  <p>  The Northern and Western region&rsquo;s status as a transition region is being taken into account in the planning of the 2021-2027 programme. An independent Needs Analysis was conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants to provide the evidence base for the future ERDF and ESF+ programmes. The report includes an analysis of regional disparities and the particular challenges faced by each region. Given the reclassification of the Northern and Western region, a specific chapter is dedicated to the past performance and the particular needs of this region. This issue will continue to be taken into account in the drafting and finalisation of the ESF+ programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700081#WRAA06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1587,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700081#WRAA06400"},{"type":"question","counter":1588,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[8893\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700081#WRAA06500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the contracts for public  relations advice and consultancy entered into by his Department over the cost of &euro;10,000 since January 2021; the nature of the contract; and the length of the contract in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1589,"content":"<p>My Department has not entered into any contracts for public relations or consultancy since January 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700081#WRAA06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":1592,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700082#WRBB00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":1591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700082#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1592,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[7902\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700082#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an appointment for registration can be offered in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1593,"content":"<p>Due to the public health restrictions currently in place under Level 5 of the Government's Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to Covid-19, the Registration Office in Burgh Quay has been closed since 23 December 2020, and until further notice.<\/p><p>The requirement to register an immigration permission in person, for those living in Dublin, will not arise until the Registration Office reopens in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.

Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have played a vital part in preventing the spread of COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant and statistics are not maintained by the Immigration Service of my Department to enable me to provide details of the profession of applicants. All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during COVID-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to announce last month that a temporary system is now in place that will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  Under the temporary new system, up to 4,000 qualifying applicants will be asked to complete a statutory declaration that will be sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division. Final processing will then take place and a certificate of naturalisation, will be sent to the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March and I am pleased to say that more than 500 certificates have recently issued.

Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of an alternative platform to large-scale citizenship ceremonies, work is well advanced on the following suite of measures designed to deal with the current unprecedented level of demand being witnessed:<\/p>  <p>  - Additional staffing resources are being assigned  to the Citizenship Division. Attendant to this development, restructuring of the organisational structure of the Division is currently underway to ensure optimal customer service delivery. <\/p>  <p>  - In the context of communications, the Citizenship website has been significantly revamped to make it more user friendly, As part of this process, a new online chat conversation application, or &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo; called Tara was introduced last December. This provides users with an instant response to frequently asked questions and mimics real-time text or message exchanges with a member of staff. There have been over 10,000 interactions on the Chatbot since it launched.  <\/p>  <p>  - Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are also well advanced, through increased digital and ICT investment. As part of this process, eTax-clearance for citizenship applicants has been introduced. Online payments have been trialled for applications from minors and the process is currently being rolled out to adult applications on a phased basis.<\/p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on enhanced customer service delivery, ensuring the integrity of the process is protected and processing applications in a timely and efficient manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700082#WRBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":1612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700082#WRBB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1613,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[8096\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700082#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 244 of 9 September 2020, if she has considered the report of the chairperson of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal in relation to the matter; the actions taken on foot of the report; if the report will be published; if a review of all IPAT decisions made by the person will be undertaken; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1614,"content":"<p>The International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) is a statutorily independent body and exercises a quasi-judicial function under the International Protection Act 2015.

Ensuring that a community can get the right support at the right time is important if we want to tackle crime with a coherent approach.  This means ensuring that the non-crime related activity of harm prevention, such as providing services to people with mental health and addiction conditions, homeless people, children, elderly and others at risk, is properly addressed. <\/p><p>In the Bill, the prevention of harm will be a specific objective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recognising the vital work Garda&iacute; do on the ground every day.  Furthermore, promoting safer communities through preventing crime and harm - particularly to individuals who are vulnerable or at risk - will be a shared responsibility involving other Departments and agencies such as health and social services, local authorities and the wider community working together.<\/p><p>I can further inform the Deputy that my Department has developed a Community Safety Policy, based on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, and which has informed the drafting of the Policing and Community Safety Bill.<\/p><p>Local Community Safety Partnerships are the new local structures proposed in the Community Safety Policy. These Partnerships will operate at local authority administrative level and replace and build upon Joint Policing Committees. They will be made up of local representatives, local services, community representatives and residents. Local Community Safety Partnerships will take a strategic approach to their work so that issues arising can be dealt with in a coordinated manner, and addressed collectively by relevant service providers in partnership with the community.

People with diabetes are unable to metabolize glucose appropriately and as a result, blood glucose levels remain above normal levels and over time can damage blood vessels. This can lead to long-term damage and disabling and potentially fatal health complications. In high-income countries, including Ireland, diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.<\/p>  <p>  The most common form of diabetes is type 2, which typically occurs in adults, although it is increasingly seen in young people, including children. Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children or young people. The third main type of diabetes is gestational diabetes, which occurs because the action of insulin is impaired during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is becoming increasingly common against rising levels of overweight and obesity as key risk factors. Those with type 1 diabetes require a regular supply of insulin, while type 2 diabetes is largely preventable and complications can be avoided or delayed through a combination of lifestyle changes, medications or insulin therapy, depending on the status of the condition and the stage of the disease in the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Globally, the number of people with diabetes has doubled during the past 20 years, making it one of the most important public health challenges facing national health care systems today. The International Diabetes Federation has recently (2019) estimated that approximately 463 million adults (20-79 years) were living with diabetes globally and that by 2045 this will rise to 700 million. In Ireland it is estimated that there are 190,000 people with diabetes. Approximately 30,000 (15%) of these have Type 1 diabetes, or genetic or secondary causes of diabetes. The remaining 160,000 (85%) patients have Type 2 diabetes with a significant proportion of these patients remaining undiagnosed. It is expected that the number of people with Type 2 diabetes will increase by 60% over the next 10-15 years.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge posed by the changing disease burden has been recognized globally, with diabetes featuring high on national and international agendas including the World Health Organisation and the European Commission. At national level countries in Europe have made progress towards developing a systematic policy response to the diabetes burden. Effective treatment reduces the risk of disability or fatal complications and its optimal management requires coordinated inputs from a wide range of health professionals, access to essential medicines and monitoring, and, ideally, a system that promotes patient empowerment and well-coordinated care. In that context in Ireland the HSE Clinical Programme in Diabetes leads the multidisciplinary coordinated response to the challenges posed by diabetes in Ireland and I have asked them to examine the matters raised by the Deputy and provide a response to him as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700084#WRDD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme","counter":1773,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700084#WRDD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1774,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[7893\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700084#WRDD03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons with type 1 diabetes who have been approved to use either the Dexcom or FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitors, CGMs, under the long-term illness scheme;

At that time, emergency legislation was introduced which amended all the regulatory acts to provide for a COVID-19 specific register to which no fees would be attached.  The Act provided that the COVID-19 registration would end on 31 July 2020, but that this could be extended by means of Ministerial order.  Orders were made in July, 2020 extending the temporary registrations to 31 December 2020, and again in December further extending to 30 June 2021 the temporary registration provisions relating to medical practitioners, pharmacists and CORU registrants.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that nursing and midwifery registration is based on a calendar year, an Order was not needed in July extending these to end December 2020, but rather the Irish Nursing and Midwifery Board (NMBI) was able to deal with such registrations ( including any new applications ) under its existing legislation. This continues to be the position and I can confirm that retired nurses who wish to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic response , including the vaccination programme, can avail of temporary restoration to the NMBI register free of charge. The NMBI has informed my Department that it is currently working with the HSE and other employers to facilitate speedy restoration in these cases. As part of this, the NMBI is currently updating the registration system MyNMBI so that, from Monday 1 March 2021, fees will be waived automatically upon restoration. In addition, the NMBI is also now making arrangements to refund fees paid by some registrants who may not have been aware of the availability of free temporary restoration for purposes of assisting with the COVID-19 pandemic response. Those wishing to restore on MyNMBI and who need support with the process can contact the NMBI directly at IEReg@nmbi.ie. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, to clarify the general position applying to restoration to the Register. It is open to a nurse or midwife to apply at any time to be removed from the Register of the NMBI , for example on retirement. This is categorised as a voluntary removal and such registrants who later wish to be restored need only to pay the annual renewal fee of &euro;100 , which is the same amount as all other current registrants.  Those registrants who have been removed from the register following non-payment of the renewal fee of &euro;100, and who later wish to be restored, incur an additional administration charge of &euro;250 in addition to the annual fee of &euro;100.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700084#WRDD07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1818,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1819,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[7940\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacant mental health staff posts in County Mayo in child mental health services;

Ensuring that all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, multi-disciplinary and patient-centred care is a priority for me and my Department. I would assure the Deputy that considerable work has been done to date in this country and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants. <\/p><p>Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) Mesh is used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women and such mesh devices have been widely used for this over the past two decades. Mesh devices continue to be placed on the market for use within the EU as they continue to be certified by European device regulatory competent authorities as being compliant with relevant EU legislation. <\/p><p>I am aware that in response to concerns raised in late 2017, the then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications. Published in November 2018, this report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. <\/p><p>In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause remains in place.  <\/p><p>The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work. The HSE has created a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information regarding the pathways for women suffering complications. In addition, multidisciplinary specialist services are now available for women suffering from mesh complications across two sites at Cork University Hospital (CUMH) and National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin. Both centres currently treat women suffering with post mesh complications and have been accepting referrals from the national pathway since it was set up in November 2018.  Women referred to these centres are generally being seen within 3 months of referral, sometimes sooner. I am informed that it has been necessary for these clinics to be cognisant of the current COVID-19 public health guidance.<\/p><p>Funding has been provided in Budget 2021 to enhance and improve gynaecology services; this includes funding  to further develop the multidisciplinary National Mesh Specialist Service, and to implement additional pelvic floor physiotherapy and clinical nurse specialist services in each maternity network. The development funding will support the ongoing work to implement the recommendations from the CMO&rsquo;s Report.<\/p><p>Since the emergence of this matter, the ongoing priority focus for the Department and the HSE has been to meet the care needs of women experiencing mesh complications. I strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points and the associated care pathways, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. <\/p><p>With regard to Baroness Cumberlege report, I am aware that in the UK, the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) Review chaired by Baroness Cumberlege, was established to examine how the UK healthcare system has responded to concerns raised by patients and families about three medical interventions, one of which was mesh. <\/p><p>The safety of mesh devices has been the focus of considerable regulatory, policy, clinical, and political scrutiny in many jurisdictions in recent years including the United States of America (USA), England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Australia and other European countries, resulting in several safety reviews by regulatory bodies and other national health systems.<\/p><p>International evidence and learning play an important role in health policy considerations to promote safe, high quality care for patients. Any relevant learnings from the review will be taken into account as my Department continues to work with the HSE, the HPRA, and other stakeholders to support implementation of the recommendations of the CMO&rsquo;s report on the use of use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures.<\/p><p>Women's health is a priority for this Government, as outlined in the Programme for Government. In relation to the wider work of my Department, Budget 2021 will provide a significant investment in services that are important to women, including gynaecology services. It will also provide a Women&rsquo;s Health Fund which will support proposals arising from the work of the women&rsquo;s health taskforce to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1850,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1851,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[7953\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1852,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for bed capacity related to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.<\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

The Framework is now past the mid-way point for implementation. <\/p><p>Since publication in 2013, there has been significant progress in implementation. This has included:<\/p><p>- A focus on building an enabling environment for cross-sectoral and collaborative action, supported by a stakeholder engagement and communications strategy.<\/p><p>- Significant cross government and intersectoral partnerships and working has been created by the Framework.<\/p><p>- A suite of national policies and plans to address risk factors such as obesity, tobacco and physical inactivity have been published, and policy direction across areas such as cancer, maternity care, drugs and mental health has been informed and influenced by Healthy Ireland. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the progress to date, there is an urgent need to scale and expand the activity across all strands of the work, from Government to local level, to support effective implementation, and to capitalise on further opportunities to involve more sectors in implementation.<\/p><p>In late 2019, the Health and Wellbeing Unit in my Department commenced the development of a Strategic Action Plan for the next phase of the Healthy Ireland Framework. Despite the challenges caused by Covid-19, which has caused some delays to the original timeline for this process, significant progress on the development of the Strategic Action Plan for Healthy Ireland has been made. To date the process has already completed a rapid review of previous progress, extensive stakeholder engagement, a desktop review of other jurisdictions for best practice, and a review of goals for alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Programme for Government.  <\/p><p>Presently a set of emerging priorities is being considered in partnership with other Government Departments and internally in the Department of Health. The Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan is expected to be finalised in early 2021, for agreement across Government and subsequent publication.<\/p><p><b><i>National Maternity Strategy<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to 'Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health' and Budget 2021 provides a very significant investment to deliver on this commitment. This includes funding of &euro;12m to ensure a continued impetus to the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy and to improve gynaecology services. In addition, building on the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, a &euro;5m Women&rsquo;s Health Fund was allocated in Budget 2021 to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the National Maternity Strategy was published in 2016. The Strategy aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, from the right team and in the right place. Similarly, the Strategy aims to increase choice for women whilst ensuring that services are safe, standardised and of the highest quality. It recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, at the Strategy&rsquo;s core is an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.<\/p><p>The phased implementation of the Strategy is being led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP). Development funding provided to the NWIHP in 2021 to progress the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation will serve to:<\/p><p>- further develop community-based midwifery services;<\/p><p>- address deficits identified in HIQA inspection reports;<\/p><p>- improve access to specialist  and allied health professional services and supports;<\/p><p>- strengthen training and education supports (e.g. CTG training).<\/p><p>- Further progress the roll out of the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System, which supports better, safer clinical decision-making and a more connected and integrated health service delivering improved health outcomes.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the impact of COVID 19, work continued in 2020 to implement the Strategy and to further develop and expand community midwifery services, to facilitate the roll-out of the <i>Supported Care Pathway<\/i>and to enable women to avail of maternity care at the lowest level of complexity. In addition, the first National Maternity Experience Survey, a key recommendation of the Strategy, was conducted in 2020. The survey reports, published in October, were largely positive, and provide tangible evidence and rich qualitative information about what matters to women and their partners, and identifies, from their perspective, what areas require further focus and improvement.<\/p><p>Through the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy the quality and safety of our maternity services has improved. The Deputy can be assured that our maternity services are developing progressively and the benefits are being experienced by almost 80,000 families who access such services each year. Development funding has been provided for additional midwives, consultants, theatre staff, ultrasonographers and quality and safety managers; increasingly women have more choice in the service they receive with the development of community midwifery services and the availability of home from home birthing options; access to routine anomaly scanning has increased; Bereavement Teams are in place in every maternity unit; the perinatal mental health model of care is being implemented; all maternity hospitals\/units now publish a Maternity Safety Statement on a monthly basis; and phase 1 of the roll-out of the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System has been completed. <\/p><p>The Strategy Implementation Plan is currently being reviewed by the NWIHP with a view to assessing the overall status of implementation and to provide up-to-date timelines for the individual recommendations. My Department will continue to work with the NWIHP in 2021 to support ongoing implementation of the Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1862,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1863,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[7969\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700085#WREE04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has considered monitoring the presence of Covid-19 in wastewater streams thereby securing significant data on emerging incidences of Covid-19 within the population or a region (details supplied); if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this is being carried out in several other European Union jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1864,"content":"<p>At its meeting on 12 November 2020, the NPHET endorsed a paper &ldquo;SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance in Ireland&rdquo; and recommended that the NVRL and HPSC work collaboratively to implement a national wastewater surveillance network for SARS-CoV-2.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card. However, I also recognise that patients require a responsive and compassionate health system to meet their medical needs, particularly in cases of terminal illness. I am therefore pleased to confirm that the Government recently agreed to introduce an administrative arrangement for up to 12 months on an interim basis, that will enable persons who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less, to be awarded a medical card.

The MOH also reports such cases onwards to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). This is to ensure that test results are reported to relevant stakeholders for monitoring and surveillance purposes and to investigate cases, thus preventing spread of infection and further cases. This requirement also applies to all private testing services who are, therefore, legally obliged to report positive Covid-19 case to the relevant authorities.<\/p><p>As Minister for Health, I do not have statutory responsibility relating to the provision of privately operated COVID-19 testing facilities.

The legislation necessary to establish the Tribunal, the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 passed through the Oireachtas and was signed into law by the President on 23 July 2019. <\/p>  <p>  It was originally intended that the CervicalCheck Tribunal would be established by the end of March 2020. However, establishment was delayed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. A further delay arose in June 2020 when previously nominated members were no longer in a position to take up roles in the Tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  I commenced the relevant sections of the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 on 21 October 2020 and signed the order to appoint 27 October 2020 as the establishment day of the Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  Following a pause in the steps towards full establishment of the Tribunal, to allow for discussions with the 221+ Patient Representative Group about the Tribunal and CervicalCheck Cases generally, the establishment of the Tribunal was finalised with the appointment of the nominated members with effect from 1 December 2020, facilitating the Tribunal in starting its work and providing women who are eligible to make a claim to the Tribunal with an alternative to the Courts for their claims.<\/p>  <p>  The Tribunal remains the most appropriate venue to hear and determine CervicalCheck claims. It has been specifically designed for that purpose. It is, of course, entirely up to eligible women as to whether or not they use it.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of screening it is important to note that all of the recent major reviews and reports state that our national cancer screening programmes, including CervicalCheck, meet international standards, are valuable in improving the health of our population, and that the public can have confidence in them.  However, it is also important to highlight the limitations associated with screening programmes, Interval cancers occur in all screening programmes. The National Screening Services strive to prevent or diagnose as many cancers as possible but acknowledge that all international programmes report a number of interval cancers each year.<\/p>  <p>  In his report Mr. Justice Meenan explained the limitations of the screening process and the implications that these limitations have for the issue of liability with regard to CervicalCheck claims. Accordingly, the format for the CervicalCheck Tribunal which Mr. Justice Meenan recommended recognises the issues of liability involved in CervicalCheck cases and allows them to be addressed by the Tribunal.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Cervical Check, the programme made the technical transition to HPV cervical screening in March of last year. This improved testing methodology, along with the continued roll-out of HPV vaccinations, means that Ireland can look forward to a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer cases over the next 10-20 years. It is worth noting that since CervicalCheck started in 2008, the number of women who developed cervical cancer has fallen by 7% year on year between 2010-2015. In the absence of screening, cervical cancer may not have been detected in these people until they developed physical signs or symptoms of more advanced disease.<\/p>  <p>  Screening is a population health measure for people who are presumed healthy and do not have symptoms.  An important message for the public, including anyone who may be between screening tests or waiting for a rescheduled appointment, is to be aware of, and act upon, any symptoms associated with the conditions they are screened for. Anyone with concerns about symptoms should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700086#WRFF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1933,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700086#WRFF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1934,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[8086\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700086#WRFF05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if travel to a new residence is deemed essential in cases in which the rental lease of a person has expired and they must move while current level 5 restrictions are in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1935,"content":"<p>As you will be aware, Ireland is currently at level 5 of Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. <\/p><p>At level 5, people are asked to stay at home as much as possible unless they have a &quot;reasonable excuse&quot; for leaving. <\/p><p>The Regulations providing for these measures are set out in S.I.

The commissioning of these reports by the HSE arose from recommendations in the Scally Scoping Inquiry Report.<\/p><p>Implementation of the recommendations of the ERG reports is now underway, with implementation groups already established by the HSE, which include patient representatives, as well as clinicians and other screening services staff.<\/p><p>Important actions across all programmes will be to adapt and enhance the information provided to participants so they can better understand the benefits and limitations of their screening test, and so make informed decisions as partners in their own healthcare. Some of the challenges in achieving better public understanding of screening stem from the fact that cancer screening programmes are population health measures, designed to improve outcomes on a population-wide basis, and not designed to be diagnostic on an individual level.<\/p><p>As highlighted in the ERG reports, interval cancers, ie any cancer that is diagnosed after a previous normal screening test is carried out and before another screening test is carried out, are an unfortunate but inevitable fact given that no screening test is 100% accurate, and false negatives do occur. While screening offers the benefit of detecting many cancers at an earlier stage, this is sadly not always the case.<\/p><p>A cancer diagnosis is a very stressful and often devastating event for anyone, and where such a cancer is diagnosed in a person who has participated in a screening programme, it is also important that the manner of the disclosure and discussion of  a patient&rsquo;s screening history does not add further undue stress. The ERG reports set out a number of guiding principles for clinical audit which will underpin the development of the future framework for clinical audit and review. This includes the principle that communications with patients diagnosed with cancers must be respectful and open. In terms of the design of patient-requested case reviews as part of the implementation of the ERG reports, these will be developed in a consultative and collaborative manner with patient representatives.<\/p><p>In relation to CervicalCheck, the introduction last year of the HPV screening test is a significant milestone for our cervical cancer screening programme, as this test is more sensitive and typically detects 18 out of 20 abnormalities, compared to the 15 out of 20 the smear test typically detects. Going forward, this will mean in overall terms, even with the most effective and sensitive screening programme, that  approximately 2 in every 1000 screened will still not be detected and interval cancers will still occur. This is undoubtedly, and sadly, unfortunate, and devastating for the individuals concerned.<\/p><p>This is also why it is so important that the public understands that screening is a population health measure for people who are presumed healthy and do not have symptoms. An important message for the public, including anyone who may be between screening tests or waiting for a rescheduled appointment, is to be aware of, and act upon, any symptoms associated with the conditions they are screened for. Anyone with concerns about symptoms should always contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.<\/p><p>It is also important to re-iterate that all of the recent major reviews and reports state that our national cancer screening programmes, including CervicalCheck, meet international standards, are valuable in improving the health of our population, and that the public can have confidence in them.<\/p><p>In terms of a population perspective,  when we consider that over 6,000 women are detected and referred for early treatment each year, cervical screening continues to have significant value for population health.<\/p><p>As Minister for Health, my priority is to continue the work to restore the CervicalCheck screening programme as a leading international cancer screening programme, to improve public trust and confidence in screening, and further the global aim to eradicate cervical cancer<b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700087#WRGG07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2033,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700087#WRGG07400"},{"type":"question","counter":2034,"qnumday":731,"qnumall":"[8194\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700087#WRGG07500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 895 of 3 February, if the CEO of the HSE has been vaccinated against Covid-19; if other members of HSE management have been vaccinated, in particular those who form part of the HSE's senior leadership team and those who are members of the HSE board; and if staff members at the HSE headquarters at Dr. Stevens' Hospital building have been vaccinated (details supplied).

As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2040,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2041,"qnumday":733,"qnumall":"[8214\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if mop-up clinics are currently under way in nursing homes that will enable residents to receive a second vaccine (details supplied); when every nursing home resident will receive the second vaccine; the process which applies if a nursing home resident cannot receive the vaccine within the recommended 21-day period; if they will have to start the vaccination process again; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2042,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2044,"qnumday":734,"qnumall":"[8216\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position of persons with chronic kidney disease on the Covid-19 vaccine allocation strategy priority list of groups for vaccination.","asker":"1466","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2045,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.<\/p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>The next group (Group 3) to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74.

This assessment was completed in February 2020, with the NCPE recommending that Patisiran not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.<\/p>  <p>  The HTA report with respect to Patisiran was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial discussions with the applicant which took place in May 2020, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process.  The HSE Drugs Group requested patient and clinician input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) regarding reimbursement of Patisiran.<\/p>  <p>  The RDTRC convened on 24 September and reviewed the clinical data previously submitted as part of the established pricing and reimbursement process. The Committee also heard from Consultants involved in the specialist management of patients with hATTR amyloidosis. The RDTRC continued its review of Patisiran at its subsequent meeting on 5 November which included patient input on the impact of hATTR amyloidosis.<\/p>  <p>  Following these meetings, the Committee finalised a statement summarising the clinician and patient engagement on Patisiran which was received by the HSE on 26 November 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it met with the applicant company in December 2020 and in early January 2021 for further discussions and deliberations on the pricing position.<\/p>  <p>  At its January 2021 meeting, the HSE Drugs Group reviewed all the relevant documentation concerning the application, including information provided by the RDTRC. The HSE has advised that, having considered all of the criteria of which is obliged to take account, the HSE Drugs Group was unable to recommend in favour of reimbursement.<\/p>  <p>  The decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE EMT. The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that, on 9th February, it issued notice to the applicant company of the proposed decision of the EMT not to support reimbursement of Patisiran.<\/p>  <p>  Where the HSE EMT team has considered a recommendation of non-reimbursement from the HSE Drugs Group and is minded to accept such a recommendation, the HSE is legally required (in line with the 2013 Health Act) to set out in detail a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE, where such circumstances apply, is also legally required to provide at least a 28-day period (from the formal written notice of proposal) to enable an applicant company to consider the proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE. The HSE is legally required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by the HSE that it received an application in August 2019 for the reimbursement of Inotersen (Tegsedi) for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR).<\/p>  <p>  On 26 August 2019, the HSE commissioned a rapid review with respect to this indication. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on 7 October 2019 that a full HTA was required for this medicine to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of Inotersen compared with the current standard of care.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 9 October 2019 as per agreed processes. As of 11 February 2021, the applicant has not submitted a HTA dossier to the NCPE for assessment. A completed HTA is required to progress this application, as per the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  The applications for Patisiran and Inotersen remain under consideration in line with the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Services","counter":2097,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH06600"},{"type":"question","counter":2098,"qnumday":754,"qnumall":"[8279\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH06700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of staff employed directly and currently in post, excluding any persons on maternity or other leave, in the primary care service for north County Dublin by grade and area covered; the number who work directly with individuals under 18 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2099,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":2100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH06900"},{"type":"question","counter":2101,"qnumday":755,"qnumall":"[8280\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH07000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the growing waiting list to access CAMHS from the north county and city of Dublin CAMHS service based in Swords; the number employed by grade and whole-time equivalent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2102,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2104,"qnumday":756,"qnumall":"[8281\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH07300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the urgent need for additional staffing for the CAMHS service based in Swords, County Dublin; the details of the planned recruitment by grade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2105,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700088#WRHH07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Obesity Strategy","counter":2107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700089#WRJJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2108,"qnumday":757,"qnumall":"[8282\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700089#WRJJ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of the members of the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group; the members of the two subgroups of the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group on reformulation and healthy eating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2109,"content":"<p>&lsquo;A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rsquo;, the Government&rsquo;s Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP), was launched in September 2016 under the auspices of the Healthy Ireland agenda.It covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. <\/p><p>An Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017.

In addition, the Programme was mandated to drive and lead the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The NWIHP therefore provides strategic direction and leadership, drives improvement, and fosters a learning culture in maternity, neonatal and gynaecological services. The Programme also aims to ensure that learning from adverse incidents is disseminated and applied in a comprehensive and consistent manner, promoting a national approach to consistent, evidenced-based practice in maternity care.  The Programme has identified the development of key performance indicators in the areas of maternity and gynaecology services as a priority for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme is intended to act as the single central authority on maternity care and as a reference point and resource for women&rsquo;s health issues within the HSE.  The Programme is also tasked with the appropriate allocation and effective, specific targeting of all new development funding for maternity, neonatal and gynaecological services. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the actions being taken regarding maternal mental health, the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service Model of Care was launched by the HSE in November 2017 and is currently being implemented. The new model of care addresses the seven key actions identified in the National Maternity Strategy, including developing and delivering access to appropriate care, early identification and a multidisciplinary approach by skilled professionals, including standardised access to perinatal psychiatry and psychology. <\/p>  <p>  Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Services are aligned to the six maternity networks and, in that context, are being developed in a hub and spoke model.  Funding of some &euro;3.6m was provided in recent years for the six Specialist Perinatal Mental Health hub teams at the Rotunda Hospital; National Maternity Hospital; Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital; Cork University Maternity Hospital; University of Limerick Maternity Hospital; and University Hospital Galway.  While some gaps in staffing remain, all of the hub sites are now in operation.  On average, eight to nine multidisciplinary staff provide services at each site. <\/p>  <p>  Along with six hub teams, there are 13 spoke sites in the other maternity units.  An integral component of the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service Model of Care is the deployment of a mental health midwife to each of the 13 maternity spoke sites. The mental health midwife augments the liaison psychiatry services and their focus is on women with mild to moderate mental health problems throughout the perinatal period.   An equally important aspect is to educate all midwives, public health and practice nurses on the need to ask women about their mental, as well as their physical health.  11 of the 13 spoke mental health midwives are now in place and the recruitment process is in train for the two remaining sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700089#WRJJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cannabis for Medicinal Use","counter":2140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700089#WRJJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2141,"qnumday":768,"qnumall":"[8325\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700089#WRJJ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he plans to bring amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to ensure that plants containing cannabidiol, CBD, with a tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, content of less than 0.2% can be grown without fear of prosecution and to align Irish law with EU legislation on the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2142,"content":"<p>The two most common active components found in cannabis oil are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). <\/p><p>THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis.

Mr. Justice Charles Meenan on an Alternative System for Dealing with Claims Arising from CervicalCheck. In his report Mr. Justice Meenan explained the limitations of the screening process and the implications that these limitations have for the issue of liability with regard to CervicalCheck claims. <\/p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan considered the appropriateness of a redress or compensation scheme to address claims arising from CervicalCheck and referenced such schemes including the statutory Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal. Mr. Justice Meenan advised that such a scheme was not appropriate for CervicalCheck cases as in those schemes it was not necessary to prove negligence or breach of duty for compensatory damage, and instead recommended a format that would allow the issues of liability to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Judge Meenan recommended that the Tribunal would have power to determine issues of liability and award damages on the same basis as a judge of the High Court, and that the Tribunal legislation should require the Tribunal to hear and determine claims on the same basis as that Court.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Tribunal will make awards relating to recurrence in the same way as the High Court. That is, an additional amount can be made as part of the Tribunal settlement, to factor in a future chance of recurrence.  <\/p>  <p>  An advantage of the Tribunal over the courts is that, if a claimant does not wish to accept the amount awarded by the Tribunal, they can appeal to the High Court, an extra step that would not be available if the claimant had gone directly to the High Court. However, just like the Court system, a claimant cannot return with a second claim in respect of the same event years later. Providing for eligible women to return to the Tribunal for additional claims would also require the Tribunal to be in existence indefinitely.<\/p>  <p>  In his Report Mr. Justice Meenan set out the necessary features of any alternative system for CervicalCheck claims, which in addition to recognising the issues of liability involved, included that participation in any alternative system must be on a voluntary basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is unlikely that respondents or third parties would consent to participate in an open-ended process when the courts could offer certainty and finality, meaning that no cases would ultimately be heard by the Tribunal, leaving the eligible women with no option other than the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700089#WRJJ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2162,"qnumday":775,"qnumall":"[8347\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700089#WRJJ05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on extending the statute of limitations for those individuals affected by the CervicalCheck scandal to lodge a High Court case given the complications of both Covid-19 and the delay in establishing the CervicalCheck tribunal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2163,"content":"<p>A concern has been raised that some women eligible for the CervicalCheck Tribunal may now be outside the Statute of Limitations as a result of the delay in establishing the Tribunal, which was due to COVID-19 and issues with regard to Tribunal membership.<\/p>  <p>  Any extension to the statute of limitations in respect of claims before the High Court would be a matter for the Minister for Justice.

Currently there are almost 2,500 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme and as at 1 January,18 panels, or less than 1%, are vacant. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. There are currently no vacancies in New Ross. <\/p>  <p>  Where a medical card or GP visit card holder experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him\/her as a patient, or where the person has been removed from another GP's list or refused entry onto a GP's list, the HSE has the power to assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.<\/p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. Where a GP practice has a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients, patients should contact other GP practices in the surrounding areas.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. <\/p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement GP. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 214 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021.

With regard to the specific details, I will first deal with mesh implants and then consider sodium valproate.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence and Pelvic Organ Prolapse in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that in response to concerns raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, the then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the matter, which was published in November 2018. The report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019.  The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work. The HSE has created a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information regarding the pathways for women suffering complications. In addition, multidisciplinary specialist services are now available for women suffering from mesh complications across two sites at Cork University Hospital (CUMH) and National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  In line with good practice internationally, the establishment of an independent, compassionate process for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard is currently being scoped and this may help to drive learning across the health service and ensure that the healthcare system has appropriate responses in place.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the medicine, sodium valproate, I am aware of historical and current issues surrounding the use of sodium valproate by women during pregnancy. I am also aware of the significant work carried out by the HSE and the HPRA over the last two years to implement European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendations from 2018 and to provide support to families who may have concerns about previous exposure to sodium valproate and the possible impact on their children.<\/p>  <p>  As I understand it, the HSE has improved the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome (FVS), including the establishment of a dedicated genetics clinic in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin. This means that families now have access to a clear diagnostic pathway if they feel their child may be affected by FVS.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently committed to holding an inquiry into the historical licensing and use of sodium valproate in Ireland and have asked officials in my department to examine a number of different options for the structure of this inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2620,"content":"<p>Question No. 938 answered with Question No. 804.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2621,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS01800"},{"type":"question","counter":2622,"qnumday":939,"qnumall":"[8845\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to his statement in D&aacute;il Eireann on 11 February 2021, the status of his review of the vaccine priority list for those with very serious underlying medical conditions and transplant patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2623,"qnumday":950,"qnumall":"[8870\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of consultations he has had with the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, regarding persons who are immunosuppressed and their wish to receive Covid-19 vaccines sooner than planned; if he has outlined the stress that many of these patients are under as a consequence of nearly a full year of cocooning; and his plans to assist this cohort of persons.","asker":"1602","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2624,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 939 and 950 together.<\/p><p>The National Immunisation Advisory Committee continues to review all national and international data in order to inform the vaccine allocation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2625,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS02200"},{"type":"question","counter":2626,"qnumday":940,"qnumall":"[8847\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of children's diabetes services in the Regional Hospital Mullingar; the details on the current staffing levels and approval for further positions; the steps he will take to ensure the service can remain open with sufficient safe staffing levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2627,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS02500"},{"type":"question","counter":2629,"qnumday":941,"qnumall":"[8857\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700096#WRSS02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to vaccinate members of the Defence Forces who are serving overseas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2630,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.

The Departments of Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth, Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, and Rural &amp;amp; Community Development are also represented, along with Sport Ireland, the HSE, the Federation of Irish Sport, the LGMA and the academic sector.<\/p><p>Key initiatives underway include the Active School Flag programme and national strategies for walking and cycling. Increasing physical activity levels in children and young people is a priority focus. Improving physical activity in women and girls has also been identified as an early priority area by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce.  Implementation of the current Physical Activity Plan will be reviewed this year with a view to charting the future direction of the Plan.<\/p><p>While the restrictions imposed in response to Covid 19 have impacted on sports facilities, team sports and other sporting activities, research published by Sport Ireland in mid-2020 shows that individual adult activity levels had risen, with more people participating in walking, cycling, running and outdoor swimming.<\/p><p>As presentations at the recent virtual Irish Physical Activity Research Collaboration conference made clear, regular physical activity can boost positive immune responses while reducing markers of inflammation, and regular exercise is also effective in reducing the severity of symptoms associated with anxiety and depression.<\/p><p>Recent research carried out by DCU regarding the Department of Education&rsquo;s Active School Flag programme, which is co-sponsored by Healthy Ireland, would indicate positive effects of this programme on school activity levels, but also on attendance, behaviour and learning outcomes.<\/p><p>Bearing in mind the vital role of physical activity in terms of protecting varied aspects of both physical and mental health and wellbeing, the Keep Well national citizen engagement campaign was launched in autumn 2020 as part of the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery Plan.

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. <\/p>  <p>  This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I requested a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny from the Business Committee, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il, and this waiver was granted on 4th February 2021. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).  Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.<\/p><p>Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.  Funding of &euro;2m was provided to the HSE to commence Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care in 2020. This was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, Cork Maternity University Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. <\/p><p>Additional funding of just over &euro;1m is being made available to enable the continuation of Phase One of the roll-out in 2021, including through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, to be located in Galway and Limerick. <\/p><p>The roll out of Phase One has been slowed due to the management of the Covid-19 pandemic by the health service broadly and its impact upon the provision of elective health services, including fertility services.<\/p><p>Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.  Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country and the AHR legislation is commenced.  Drafting of the AHR legislation is ongoing, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.<\/p><p>In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.<\/p><p>Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700097#WRTT05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2728,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700097#WRTT05800"},{"type":"question","counter":2729,"qnumday":982,"qnumall":"[8970\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700097#WRTT05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding designated quarantine centres for healthcare workers who test positive for Covid-19; the number of such centres; when they commenced operation; the location of each; the number of persons who have been quarantined in such centres to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2730,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700097#WRTT06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2731,"content":"<p>Question No. 983 answered with Question No. 804.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":2733,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700098#WRUU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2734,"qnumday":984,"qnumall":"[8978\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700098#WRUU00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of HSE bills for cancer patients outsourced to debt collectors in 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2735,"content":"<p>Patient charges are a key element of the overall funding envelope of the Irish health system and are taken into account when agreeing the Annual Estimates and the subsequent preparation of the annual National Service Plan.  <\/p><p>These charges typically include:  <\/p><p>- Out-patient charges; <\/p><p>- Emergency Department charges; <\/p><p>- Daily in-patient charges; and #<\/p><p>- Long-term stay charges.<\/p><p>There are cohorts of people who are exempt from these charges, including, but not limited to persons with full eligibility, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks, children suffering from diseases prescribed under section 52 (2) of the Act, and persons receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of infectious diseases. <\/p><p>In addition, patients who opt for private in-patient services in public hospitals are liable for a range of private accommodation charges.

In this regard, authorised officers engage with keepers making them aware of their responsibilities and generally issue a compliance notice in the first instance to ensure compliance with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700098#WRUU07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":2806,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700098#WRUU07300"},{"type":"question","counter":2807,"qnumday":1009,"qnumall":"[8236\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700098#WRUU07400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann covers the cost of vaccination, neutering and a pet passport before the greyhound is rehomed as part of the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust and funded through the Greyhound Care Fund.","asker":"1468","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2808,"content":"<p>R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann (RC&Eacute;) is a commercial state body, established under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.

It is a sector with great tradition in Irish agriculture and holds significant potential for the future. My Department has introduced a number of specific support measures for the tillage sector in recent years. In 2015, a Voluntary Coupled Protein Aid Scheme was introduced providing a fund of &euro;3 million with the aim of sustaining production of plant proteins to a level of 12,000 hectares. It is proposed to continue with the VCS for the CAP transitional period for tillage farmers. Furthermore, my Department is considering the continuation of the VCS for protein crops in the next CAP in order to promote the growing of native protein crops. <\/p>  <p>  The Tillage Capital Investment Scheme (TCIS), under TAMS II, covers specific areas of investment including Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Fertiliser Spreaders and increasing Grain Storage and Drying capacity. Over &euro;16m has been paid to farmers to date under the Scheme. In addition, over &euro;7m has been paid to farmers for tillage investments under the Young Farmer&rsquo;s Capital Investment Scheme as part of TAMS II.  <\/p>  <p>  The horticultural sector operates in an open market, increasingly international and competitive. Ongoing development of horticulture is dependent on its ability to maintain and extend its competitive advantages in this environment. In spite of these challenges the industry has seen a growth in output value of some 30% in the 10 years since 2010. This growth has been assisted by the strong investment by the sector in new technologies, including public investment. My Department operates the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, focusing on small to medium sized enterprises. This Scheme is intended to assist in the development of the horticulture sector, including beekeeping, by grant aiding capital investments in specialised Horticultural plant and equipment. It aims to facilitate environmentally friendly practices, promote the diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products and improve working conditions. For 2021, the budget for this Scheme was significantly increased to &euro;9 million.<\/p>  <p>  My Department promotes the transition to organic tillage and horticulture farming by providing the highest organic payment rates for conversion and maintenance for tillage and horticulture. In addition, under TAMS II, a dedicated capital investment scheme (Organic Capital Investment Scheme (OCIS)) is in place providing support for organic tillage farmers for a wide range of equipment and structures.<\/p>  <p>  Forestry and agro-forestry offer significant opportunities for farm diversification, and my Department supports forestry through planting grants, premia and various schemes to incentivise increased planting, particularly to encourage the planting of broadleaf species. <\/p>  <p>  Negotiations on the new Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) are underway and the CAP Strategic Plan will provide in excess of &euro;12 billion in funding to farmers and rural communities in the period from 2023 to 2027. In the interim, support continues under the Rural Development Programme, with payments in excess of &euro;1.7 billion in 2020. My Department will continue to support cereals, crops and horticulture with appropriate supports under CAP.<\/p>  <p>  The agri-food sector has benefited from an approach to strategic planning through the development of 10-year stakeholder-led strategies, updated every five years. Since their inception 20 years ago, up to the current Food Wise 2025 plan, these strategies have ensured that the sector has a coherent, stakeholder-led vision and strategy to underpin the sector's continued development and all sectors are considered, including cereals, crops and horticulture. Currently, a Committee representative of the sector is developing the agri-food strategy to 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The development of the strategy is a commitment of the Programme for Government, to provide, &ldquo;an ambitious blueprint for the industry for the years ahead, adding value sustainably in the agri-food sector into the future and supporting family farms and employment in rural Ireland&rdquo;. The strategy is expected to be published in the first half of this year and will include actions for cereals, crops and horticulture in the period to 2030. The Strategy is also expected to look at the potential for diversification into organic production, as well as the potential for farmers to diversify further into forestry production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700099#WRVV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":2819,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700099#WRVV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2820,"qnumday":1013,"qnumall":"[8354\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700099#WRVV01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the preparations and actions his Department and all relevant agencies under his remit have taken to date to ensure the smooth introduction of regulation given the recent agreement by the fisheries committee of the European Parliament on a proposal to update the control regulation for fishing activities in the EU and in particular relating to the geolocation and electronic logbook mandatory for small boats aspect of the proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":2821,"qnumday":1014,"qnumall":"[8355\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700099#WRVV01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consult in an extensive and meaningful manner with industry well in advance of the implementation of regulations resulting from the proposal to update the control regulation for fishing activities in the EU given that recent agreement by the fisheries committee of the European Parliament on a proposal to update the control regulation for fishing activities in the EU will impact hundreds of operators in the inshore sector and the potential challenges it presents for them including possessing the digital capacity to comply with such regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":2822,"qnumday":1015,"qnumall":"[8356\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700099#WRVV01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he is taking to support the inshore sector in meeting challenges complying with the EU fisheries committee proposal to update the control regulation for fishing activities in the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2823,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1013 to 1015, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Council Regulation 1224\/2009, known as the Control Regulation, establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and establishing a level playing-field across the EU on fisheries control.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the Commission published a proposal to amend the Control Regulation.

It also sets out the need to enhance the link between communities and food production and in this regard, commits to promoting short, efficient routes to market that connect small food producers to the consumer and providing advisory, investment and marketing support for those who wish to diversify into new products. The PfG also commits to support the small food producer, providing support for on-farm diversification enterprises and investment in local processing facilities, allowing farmers to sell their products into the local and wider domestic markets. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and agencies under its responsibility, including Bord Bia and Teagasc, offers a range of supports to help implement these commitments.

The NFO will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is taking a two step approach to the establishment of the NFO. Firstly a statutory instrument will be drafted to transpose the UTP Directive by the deadline of 1st May 2021. This will provide for an Enforcement Authority which will have the powers as currently provided for in the Directive. The legislative and operational requirements for establishing a new Office of a Food Ombudsman or equivalent that might provide for functions other than those provided for in the UTP Directive are being examined. Primary legislation will be required both to establish this new authority, and to provide for any further powers which may be given to that office. My Department is giving this matter priority.<\/p>  <p>  The UTP Directive does not address issues of price determination or negotiation. While the new authority will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland, it is important to be aware, however, that this authority will not have a role in determining price.

It is important to be aware, however, that this authority will not have a role in determining price.  <\/p>  <p>  Establishment of the NFO is ongoing and firstly requires the drafting of a statutory instrument to transpose the UTP directive before the deadline of May 2021. Legislation is then required to establish the new office of the NFO. It is intended that there will be a national consultation process on the functions of the NFO  prior to the primary legislation being enacted.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Beef Taskforce work on price transparency and the completion of the three market transparency studies commissioned by my Department will be an important step towards improving visibility of the complex supply chain which is integral in fostering trust and enhancing supply chain relationships.

It is more important than ever that we all work together given the unique set of challenges currently faced by the sector.

Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), which was piloted in 2019, was to further increase economic and environmental efficiency in the suckler herd through better quality data on herd performance supporting decision making on farm. The key measure of the scheme is aimed at measuring weaning efficiency and this objective determines the timing of weighing. The 2019 budget allocated a total of &euro;20 million for BEEP.  A total of 16,556 farmers participated in the pilot with payments totalling &euro;15.4m. Building on the success of the BEEP pilot of 2019, its successor BEEP-S of 2020 included optional animal health and welfare measures and provided payments of over &euro;40 million to over 24,000 beef farmers. <\/p>  <p>  Both of these schemes are now closed and payments have issued.  <\/p>  <p>  The details of the Beef Sector Efficiency Pilot announced in Budget 2021 are currently being finalised and this process includes consultations with key stakeholders including the main farm organization representatives.

The development of this policy was underpinned by extensive consultation with rural communities. Ongoing dialogue will be maintained with rural stakeholders throughout the duration of the policy timeframe, in order to respond to new issues identified, including, the challenges posed by COVID-19 and the impact of Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has continued to deliver the range of policy measures to support urban and rural communities. Those policies are informed during development, by extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including Government Departments, State Agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people and the wider public. This on-going engagement process has been important in monitoring urban and rural community activity and in identifying areas relevant to the work of my Department where interventions such as targeted supports or funding are required and the most appropriate remedial or proactive measures that can be taken in response. <\/p>  <p>  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund provides investment to support suitable projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000, and outlying areas which will deliver on the National Strategic Objective of Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities and achieve sustainable economic and social development in these areas.  The third call for Category 1 applications to the Fund closed in December 2020.  Based on an analysis of the challenges faced by rural communities and ongoing discussions with stakeholders, this call for applications had a dual focus - to deliver planned and sustainable regeneration in towns and villages, and to channel investment towards economic recovery in the post Covid-19 environment, providing an immediate stimulus to support the recovery and further development of rural economies and communities.  For similar reasons, changes were also made in relation to the intensity of funding which could be sought from the Fund under this call, with the Fund providing up to 90% of the total project value for successful projects under this call.  I will announce the successful projects under this call in the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The LEADER programme remains operational through the COVID-19 crisis and payments continue to be made to the Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and to project promoters. In December last, I announced details of a Transitional LEADER Programme which will come into effect from 1 April 2021, with an initial allocation of &euro;20 million this year.<\/p>  <p>   A key focus of the Transitional Programme will be on building capacity within communities which have not received LEADER funding to date.  The programme will also support job creation, foster and encourage entrepreneurship, and support projects which address the climate agenda, digital transformation and the Smart Villages approach to building on local strengths and assets.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Transitional Programme, the grant rate for enterprises and commercially-focused community projects will be increased from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 75%.  This will further help to support enterprise development and job creation in rural areas in a post COVID and Brexit environment.<\/p>  <p>  My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme, or CSP, to provide local services through a social enterprise model, in both urban and rural communities.  CSP funding is provided as a fixed contribution towards the cost of employing an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) and a manager, where warranted.  The Department provides a co-funding contribution of &euro;32,000 per annum towards the cost of supporting a manager and &euro;19,033 per each FTE. In response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a Support Fund totalling &euro;4.75M which assists all CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll, regardless of whether the organisations are in a position to continue to provide normal activities or whether they have had to close their facilities\/services as a result of the COVID restrictions.  The CSP Support Fund provided funding to many of these CSP supported organisations, ensuring that they can pay their full-time equivalent (FTE) CSP supported employees a maximum of &euro;350 net per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP supported employees, while also assisting with the Employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period up to April 2021. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and Pobal, who administer the programme on behalf of my Department, will allow the maximum level of flexibility to these organisation and we will continue to monitor the situation closely in light of COVID and any issues that may arise.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700101#WRXX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":2957,"qnumday":1062,"qnumall":"[8603\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700101#WRXX00900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the extent to which her Department has received applications for various forms of support available from her Department in respect of urban and or rural communities; the extent of the assistance offered; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":2958,"qnumday":1064,"qnumall":"[8605\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700101#WRXX01000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the full extent of funding approved by her Department in respect of applications from community urban or rural groups; if she expects to be in a position to offer support to potential applicants in 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2959,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1062 and 1064 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s mission is to promote rural and community development and support the creation of vibrant and sustainable communities across this country and I am committed to the successful delivery of a number of programmes which have provided financial and other supports to community groups and organisations.<\/p>  <p>  These supports enable economic growth and development and also support communities in urban and rural areas to address gaps in meeting social needs, and these supports are more important than ever as we deal with the impacts of COVID-19 and Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  These ongoing challenges ensure continued demand for such supports in the form of applications received by my Department.

SICAP workers have extensive local connections and in-depth knowledge of available resources and supports and are continuing to work to ensure the emerging needs of their localities are responded to. <\/p>  <p>  - Local Development Companies (LDCs) have put in place various measures to ensure SICAP supports continue to be delivered and that vulnerable people continue to be supported throughout the COVID-19 crises, examples as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Online supports are delivered via telephone, email, Zoom, etc., with LDCs providing additional support to individuals with limited access to technology, in the form providing them with laptops\/tablets and upskilling them in their usage. <\/p>  <p>- LDCs that operate a &ldquo;friendly call&rdquo; service to elderly people saw an increase in demand for the service with some LDCs mobilizing local community groups to become involved in making regular contact with older, vulnerable isolated people during the COVID-19 crises. <\/p>  <p>  - LDCs supported an increase in demand for Meals on Wheels services and foodbanks, particularly for those not able to travel to shops and those experiencing food poverty. <\/p>  <p>  - Other responses included Pharmacy &amp;amp; Shopping Services; Employment and Self-Employment Supports; Supports to Community Groups; Online Training; Health, Well-Being and Social Prescribing; Mental Health Supports. <\/p>  <p>  - My Department offered every flexibility to the LDCs which freed up SICAP workers to focus on a community response to the crisis. Given their presence in local communities, the LDC response to the crisis was rapid and widespread with many of their 170,000 service users reached in the early days and weeks of the crisis.<\/p>  <p>- There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that COVID-19 has had a disproportionate effect on certain communities those already suffering from disadvantage would be more vulnerable to an interruption of services.   Measures were put  in place to support LDCs who continued to work under the SICAP programme with disadvantaged individuals.  My Department offered flexibility to the LDCs to redeploy SICAP staff to work as part of the  response to COVID-19. This Programme of flexibility will also continue into 2021 with additional areas of flexibility considered where required. In light of challenges faced by LDCs in engaging with beneficiaries the opportunity to reduce their targets was offered in 2020 and again in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  - Thematic support workshops will be delivered remotely by the Department and Pobal to LDCs in 2021. The purpose of these is to provide a platform to share experiences and learning from new ways of delivering supports during COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  Isolation of people of all ages is a significant risk during the pandemic, particularly during periods of tight restrictions on movement and social interaction. The Community Call programme was introduced last year to provide local helplines through Local Authorities for practical supports, information sharing and befriending. As part of the &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, and in particular, the &lsquo;Staying Connected&rsquo; strand, this has been significantly expanded to be proactive with outreach to potentially isolated persons, as the main aim. My Department is represented on the oversight committee for this initiative.<\/p>  <p>Physical and social isolation can have a significant impact on people living in rural areas. My Department is finalising a new rural development policy for the next five years, which will build on the progress achieved through the Action Plan for Rural Development, which concluded in 2019. The policy will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural communities and will identify policy measures for delivery, in order to achieve these objectives.<\/p>  <p>The National Social Enterprise Policy aims to enable social enterprises increase their social, environmental and economic impact. Many social enterprises are based in rural or isolated areas and provide services to communities that may not otherwise be available. They also operate in our cities and other urban areas, often providing services to disadvantaged communities. <\/p>  <p>Other key interventions include funding the Seniors Alert Scheme, which enables older people to live securely, with peace of mind, in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms, ensuring contact is maintained with those who are vulnerable. <\/p>  <p>In addition, as part of the Department&rsquo;s COVID-19 Action Plan, increased support was provided for older people through our funding partnership with ALONE for their crisis telephone support line and follow-on practical supports for those who need it. <\/p>  <p>Volunteering is also very much at the forefront of initiatives of this nature and the Department will continue to support volunteering both by the provision of funding and other supports, and the implementation of the recently published National Volunteering Strategy. <\/p>  <p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) funding will ensure that remote areas, particularly those that are likely to wait longest for connections, are provided with access to high-speed broadband in their communities while waiting for the National Broadband Plan roll-out to reach them. <\/p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in rural areas that have suffered significant levels of population decline. In 2020 the programme  placed a particular focus on supporting CL&Aacute;R communities to deal with the impact of COVID-19 in rural areas through the addition of a new funding measure - Meals on Wheels and Linked Services. This measure was open to established organisations and groups involved in the provision of meals on wheels with linked services. Funding of &euro;340,000 was announced on 20th November 2020 for 45 projects under this Measure. The programme also supports voluntary organisations who provide transport for service users in rural areas under the Mobility and Cancer Care Measure. On 11th December 2020, funding of almost &euro;1.3 million was announced for 26 organisations under this measure. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of isolation in rural and urban communities cuts across the work of a number of Departments, and this is reflected in ongoing work on community policing, rural transport and social inclusion, among other areas. I will continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues to monitor the adequacy of these supports to address isolation and to work to deliver sustainable outcomes that positively impact the quality of life of those living and working in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700101#WRXX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2964,"content":"<p>Question No. 1064 answered with Question No. 1062.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Enhancement Programme","counter":2965,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700101#WRXX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2966,"qnumday":1065,"qnumall":"[8606\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021700101#WRXX01800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of applications on hand in respect of the community enhancement programme; the extent to which she expects to be in a position to respond positively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2967,"content":"<p>The Community Enhancement Programme<b><\/b>provides small capital grants to community organisations to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. <\/p><p>Under the programme, funding is allocated to each local authority area and administered by the Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in each area. <\/p><p>The 2021 Community Enhancement Programme has not yet been launched and will be announced in due course.
