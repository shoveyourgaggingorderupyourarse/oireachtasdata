Ireland and the EU have been clear from the beginning that this situation can only be solved by political means, and that efforts to impose a military solution will be both fruitless and dangerous.

Coalition airstrikes in Dhamar province on 1 September killed dozens of people, and Ireland fully supports the EU statement in response to that attack. Mr Griffiths reported in September that there has been some progress on the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement, with discussions taking place in Hodeidah on practical issues such as ceasefire enhancement, disengagement from the frontlines and the redeployment of forces. The release of underage prisoners by the Government of Yemen and the Coalition, and the release of 300 prisoners by the Houthi de facto authorities, represent positive steps.  The UN Special Envoy was in Sana&rsquo;a last week for further discussions. <\/p><p>The opening of a new front in August 2019 around the southern port city of Aden, with the outbreak of fighting between former allies the Government of Yemen and the Southern Transitional Council, is a worrying development in what was already a multifaceted and extremely complex conflict. I support efforts to mediate between the two sides in this new situation. <\/p><p>EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Yemen twice this year, and our support for the UN process has been unequivocal. UNSE Griffiths has thanked the EU for its support in getting the parties to the table and sustaining the political pressure, saying it would not have been possible to reach agreement in Stockholm without the EU. <\/p><p>The EU is the largest donor to the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM). UNVIM was established in May 2016 to facilitate more efficient verification that imports of commercial goods at Yemen's ports do not contain arms. Following the Stockholm Agreement, UNVIM has also been assigned the role of supporting the Yemen Red Sea Ports Corporation in the management and inspection of ports. The UNVIM operation is making an important contribution to ensuring the continued flow of commercial goods to Yemen. <\/p><p>This conflict has had devastating humanitarian effects, with almost 80% of the population of Yemen in need of humanitarian assistance. The EU is a very significant donor to Yemen, and has contributed over &euro;700 million in development and humanitarian assistance to the country since the crisis began in 2015, of which &euro;440 million was humanitarian aid.

Health and medical needs are acute with many reported cases of diseases that had previously been eradicated or near eradication and a widespread lack of access to medicines and medical care. Ireland is fully supportive of the UN-coordinated response mechanism for humanitarian aid in the country, and of the &euro;117 million in funding provided by the EU since 2018 for humanitarian assistance.  <\/p>  <p>  The situation in the country is having an ever-growing impact on the wider region, with the number of Venezuelans who have left the country since 2015 now estimated to have reached over 4.3 million. I recently discussed the issue with Colombia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, whose country has taken in around 1.4 million refugees. I have already authorised the deployment of two Rapid Responders to assist the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in supporting the Colombian Government&rsquo;s response to the humanitarian needs of Venezuelans in Colombia. Ireland has also contributed &euro;1m to UNHCR towards this effort. We stand ready to assist further as the situation evolves. <\/p>  <p>  I continue to believe that only a peaceful, democratic solution to this crisis will offer the people of Venezuela a return to stability and prosperity. Ireland, along with our EU partners, has regularly voiced our support for the Oslo Talks process that has been facilitated by Norway. While these talks have now been suspended, Ireland, along with our EU partners, encourages both sides to engage in good faith in an inclusive, serious and results-oriented process. We continue to call for genuine engagement and the necessary flexibility to reach a result that enables transparent and internationally monitored elections, and the full reinstatement of relevant public powers, as the basis for national reconciliation and economic recovery. <\/p>  <p>  We also support EU efforts, including through the International Contact Group and Special Adviser Enrique Iglesias. I welcome the statement issued after the ICG meeting of 23 September, which reaffirms the Group's commitment to a negotiated transition leading to credible, transparent and internationally monitored presidential elections, the reinstitution of public powers and a package of guarantees enabling political coexistence. These are essential elements to overcoming the crisis and to achieving national reconciliation and economic recovery.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the continued outreach efforts of the ICG and SA Iglesias to regional and international actors regarding this crisis. The ICG met with the Lima Group in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on 26 September, where both groups reiterated their commitment to a peaceful transition and expressed their concern at the humanitarian crisis as well as the serious human rights violations in the country. <\/p>  <p>  Coordination with the Lima Group was evident at the most recent session of the Human Rights Council in September 2019. Ireland, along with several of our EU partners, co-sponsored the resolution presented by the Lima Group, which highlighted our shared concern at the reported grave human rights abuses in Venezuela and called for the establishment of a fact-finding mission to investigate these abuses. I have voiced on several occasions my deep concern regarding the serious human rights violations detailed in the report of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet that was published earlier this year, and I also had an opportunity to discuss the siutation with the High Commissioner in Dublin last week.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to follow the situation in Venezuela closely and will engage on this issue at the highest levels with my EU colleagues, including at the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels on 14 October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800066#WRB05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":68,"content":"<p>Question No. 22 answered with Question No. 19.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800066#WRB05200"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[40921\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800066#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the estimated cost in 2020 of recruiting three additional full-time architects for his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for the sourcing, management and maintenance of properties to carry out its functions overseas and well as working with the OPW on buildings in Ireland.

This indicates that the businesses that are going to be significantly impacted by Brexit are responding to the call from Revenue to prepare for Brexit by acquiring a customs registration. <\/p><p>I very much welcome Revenue&rsquo;s intensified Brexit engagement with businesses since July and I strongly urge all businesses that have received a Brexit preparedness letter from Revenue to take note of its advice thereby ensuring they are Brexit ready by 31 October.

Any recoupment of overpaid salary by an employer from an employee is a matter between the employer and employee, including in relation to the timing and amounts of any repayments by the employee.  However, the employer has obligations under tax law in this area and these obligations are not negated because of an overpayment of salary and the arrangements made to recoup the overpayment.  In that context, it is important to note that the correct pay and tax details of an employee for a tax year must be on record, not only for the purposes of determining the employee&rsquo;s tax liability, or eligibility for a tax refund, for the tax year in question, but also for the purposes of establishing entitlement to certain grants and means tested payments.<\/p><p>Revenue published guidance in the form of a Tax and Duty manual in August 2018, which set out Revenue&rsquo;s position regarding the recoupment of an overpayment of emoluments by an employer from an employee<\/p><p>.  There was no change to Revenue policy in this area; this manual simply clarified Revenue&rsquo;s position regarding overpayment of salary, as it had come to its attention that certain employers were operating outside of the underlying law in the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 and the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations 2018. <\/p><p>The applicable tax treatment regarding overpayments depends on whether the staff member makes the repayments in the current tax year, that is, the year to which the overpayment relates, or in a subsequent tax year. Where the overpayment is being recouped by means of a deduction from emoluments in the current tax year, the gross amount of the overpayment is simply deducted from gross emoluments. This has the effect of correcting the employee&rsquo;s Income Tax, USC and PRSI record in the current year. <\/p><p>Where the overpayment is being recouped by means of a deduction from emoluments paid in a later year, the gross amount of the overpayment must be deducted from the net pay. Clearly, in certain situations, overpayments may be recouped over several years.  Revenue will grant a refund of any tax or USC only when the overpayment relating to the tax year has been repaid, regardless of the amount of time it takes to recover the overpayment.  <\/p><p>Section 865 of the TCA 1997 imposes a statutory 4-year time limit for making a claim for repayment of tax, USC and PRSI.  Where the gross overpayment made by the employer is recouped from the net pay of the employee within the 4-year time limit from when the overpayment was made, then the individual has the opportunity to claim any tax overpaid back from Revenue within the statutory time limit.  Moreover, in situations where an overpayment will not be recouped by the employer for more than 4 years, while Revenue must apply the statutory 4-year time limit for making a claim for repayment of tax,  where an individual employee makes a valid claim for the tax year relevant to the overpayment (e.g. a claim relating to the year 2018 must be made by 31 December 2022), but the overpayment will not be totally recouped from him or her until sometime thereafter, Revenue can make the refund at a later date but only after the overpayment has been repaid in full to the employer.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Building Finance Ireland","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC03000"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[40853\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of expressions of interest received by county for the home building finance Ireland lending scheme; the number of completed applications; the number of successful and unsuccessful applications; the amount of funding offered in loans; the number of units that will be built with funding that has been committed to by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>Home Building Finance Ireland ('HBFI') published its half-year update in mid-July having commenced operations on 28th January 2019 <\/p><p>(h).

Revenue uses a range of measures designed to identify and target those involved in the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the illicit products and, wherever possible, prosecuting the persons involved. Revenue&rsquo;s strategy includes developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk focused basis. <\/p><p>Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work together on an ongoing basis in acting against tobacco crime, and both organisations cooperate closely with their Northern Ireland counterparts, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this form of criminality. In addition, Revenue works closely with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office, Europol and other international organisations, including the World Customs Organisation, in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat tobacco crime.<\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s extensive programme of work against the illegal tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success. During the period 2016 to end-August 2019, 157.8 million cigarettes and 7,826 kilograms of tobacco were seized. In addition, 104 tonnes of raw tobacco were seized when two illicit cigarette factories were discovered in Co.

In the period January to September 2019, there were five convictions connected with the smuggling of illegal tobacco products, as well as 38 convictions relating to offences such as holding or selling of illegal tobacco products.

According to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority&rsquo;s (EIOPA) Opinion of 28 June 2018, insurance contracts concluded before the Withdrawal date by UK undertakings by way of FOE or FOS are in principle valid after that date.  What has been in doubt however is the ability of insurance undertakings and insurance distributors (i.e. brokers) to continue performing certain obligations and activities and ensure service continuity with regard to such contracts, e.g. pay out claims. <\/p><p>The key response by European and domestic regulatory authorities has been to instruct insurance firms impacted by Brexit to make and implement contingency plans to ensure that they can continue to provide services to their EU customers post-Brexit.  In this regard, the Central Bank has been working closely with the regulatory authorities in the UK as well as impacted insurance undertakings from the UK to ensure that they have appropriate contingency plans in place to allow them to continue to service existing contracts in Ireland.  It is understood that a significant majority of UK\/Gibraltar insurance undertakings have prepared appropriate Brexit contingency plans which are expected to be implemented in advance of Brexit.  However, there was a legitimate concern, that a small number of such undertakings as well as a number of insurance distributors will either not have completed such contingency plans by the date of Brexit, or had made a decision not to implement them in the first place.  Such a scenario as you will appreciate gives rise to a risk in respect of their ability to continue servicing the insurance policies they have sold, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p><p>The Government has dealt with this small number of undertakings through the <i>Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019,<\/i>which was enacted earlier this year.  This legislation allows any UK\/Gibraltar-authorised insurance entity to continue the administration of both life and non-life insurance policies written in Ireland after Brexit.  This &ldquo;run-off&rdquo; regime applies even in the event of a no-deal Brexit and for a maximum period of three years from the date of Brexit.  It should be noted that, under this regime, no new policies or renewals are allowed to be written by UK-authorised insurers after a no-deal Brexit unless they receive authorisation from an EU\/EEA member state (including Ireland).<\/p><p>I would urge any consumer that has concerns about their life insurance policy to contact their insurance provider, who should be able to provide them with details of their arrangements to ensure continuity of service.  This includes whether the consumer can amend policies, or how the company will pay claims associated with policies, written prior to Brexit.<\/p><p>Finally, I would note that the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority, in a recent speech, reaffirmed their commitment to prioritising consumer protection in financial services.  The FCA has stated that UK insurers should pay claims on existing policies wherever the policyholder happens to be located.  I welcome this commitment and would expect that relevant insurers would honour policies written to Irish consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Reductions","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC04400"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[40910\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the restoration of the VAT rate to 9% to improve competitiveness in view of the fact this is the highest rate of VAT on tourist accommodation in the EU; the Brexit effects on British visitors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":136,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[40914\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rank of Ireland in the EU in terms of the level of motor insurance and business insurance costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":137,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and my Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy.

These include the following:<\/p><p>- Commencement of the remaining parts of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>, which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; this is an essential step if award levels are to be reduced.<\/p><p>- The completion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s feasibility study into adding Employer and Public Liability insurance to the National Claims Information Database (NCID). In addition, the first report of the NCID, on motor insurance, is due by the end of the year;<\/p><p>- The completion of the CSO&rsquo;s feasibility study into tracking the cost of business insurance, as it does with other forms of insurance including motor. The CSO is due to report back to my Department by the end of the year;<\/p><p>- The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries. It is expected that there will be a public consultation on this by the end of the year; and,<\/p><p>- The furtherance of measures necessary to implement Pre-Action Protocols (PAPs) for personal injury cases, beginning with medical negligence cases.<\/p><p>In addition, my colleague, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, has been engaging with insurers in order to seek a commitment that they will reduce premiums and widen their risk appetite should there be a recalibration of award levels downwards once the new personal injury guidelines are introduced.  <\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to keep working to ensure that these positive pricing trends continue and can be extended to other forms of insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Book Sales","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[41025\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if split mortgages are considered non-performing loans even when all payments have been made on time and in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[41026\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether split mortgages should be sold to venture capitalist funds among tranches of non-performing loans even when all payments have been met on time and in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the reduction in the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) across European banks is a major priority for the banking regulator, the SSM. The Irish banks have made huge progress in this regard since the height of the crisis. According to the Central Bank of Ireland, the average NPL ratio of the domestic Irish banks was 7% at end-June 2019 having stood at more than 30% at peak in 2013. In volume terms, NPLs in the domestic Irish banks have now fallen by &euro;70.2 billion (82%) from peak in 2013. A major contributor to this has been the almost 109,000 mortgage restructures, including split mortgages, which are currently in place. <\/p><p>Despite this progress, more work is required before the NPL ratios at the Irish banks reach the European average of under 4%.<\/p><p>It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale remain unchanged. For example, Start Mortgages and Pepper, the firms involved in the loan sales transacted by PTSB since 2018, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, assurances have been given that the terms of a restructure agreed before these sales took place will continue to be honoured.<\/p><p>In addition, in 2018 I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The result of this review was published last October and it is encouraging to note that the key findings included confirmation that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.<\/p><p>In relation to your question on the classification of certain mortgages as NPLs, this is a matter for the banks to determine on a case-by-case basis. In making this determination, the Central Bank has previously confirmed that &quot;credit institutions are required to comply with a range of classification requirements including the Regulatory definition of default as per Article 178 of the Capital Requirements Regulation; the Accounting definition of impaired as per the applicable accounting framework, and the Supervisory definition of non-performing as per the EBA ITS* on forbearance and non-performing exposures.&quot;  <\/p><p>Finally, I wish to highlight that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.<\/p><p><i>*ITS - Implementing Technical Standard.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC05500"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[41042\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800067#WRC05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the State will be able to recoup the &euro;3.9 million costs associated with setting up an escrow account in 2018 in relation to a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which outlines the costs associated with the recovery process and the establishment of the escrow fund. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the report, these costs were incurred by the Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners, Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, NTMA and the Central Bank of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Minister for Finance and ASI and AOE entered into an escrow framework deed giving legal effect to arrangements for the recovery of the alleged State aid.

Limerick City and County Council is scheduled to lodge a planning application with An Bord Plean&aacute;la later this year, with an anticipated construction completion date approximately two years thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The project steering group for the remainder of the Limerick City and Environs Flood Relief Scheme is currently preparing a Project Brief for the procurement of Engineering and Environmental Consultants. The appointed consultants will be tasked with identifying and designing a flood relief scheme that is technically, socially, environmentally and economically acceptable, to alleviate the risk of flooding to Limerick City and Environs to a determined standard of protection, and to procure, manage and oversee the construction of that scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The tender for consultants is scheduled to go to the Office of Public Works&rsquo; Engineering and Environmental Consultants framework at the end of Q4 2019 and appoint consultants in Q1 of 2020.  Once consultants are appointed to progress this Flood Relief Scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of these schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The CFRAM programme indicated a preliminary project cost estimate for the preferred option for Limerick City and Environs (including King&rsquo;s Island) of approximately &euro;56m.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis.  In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered unwarranted, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department restated to the trade union that their claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys.  The Department reiterated its view to the union that any industrial action is premature and unwarranted, and called on F&Oacute;RSA to reconsider their action. <\/p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department will participate in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. The Department will be requesting the assistance of the WRC in ensuring that once talks commence the industrial action be stood down to enable these discussions to progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800068#WRD05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800068#WRD05600"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[40602\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800068#WRD05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to recognise large primary schools and extend the allocation of posts (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>&euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary (2,600 in total). <\/p>  <p>  This measure allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the longstanding moratorium on these posts.

Over 1,300 additional posts in schools have been funded, including more than 370 posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes.  This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015\/16 school year to the 2018\/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period. <\/p>  <p>  The Budget 2019 measure which provided for an additional release day for teaching principals in primary schools and a further four additional release days for teaching principals in schools with special classes has been implemented for the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions, i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 posts.  The Department has committed to revising the Posts of Responsibility table in the leadership and management circulars to take into account retirements during the school year.  This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools.  I am pleased to have been able to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools for the current school year.  The first and full year costs of this increase is &euro;4 million and &euro;10 million respectively. <\/p>  <p>  All proposals made in relation to education expenditure are considered in the context of budgetary matters, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800069#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Redeployment","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800069#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[40687\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800069#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the clerical officer transfer of a person (details supplied) under the mobility scheme will be possible; and if there is a timeline for same.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The Civil Service mobility scheme comes under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and is administered through HR Shared Services.<\/p><p>According to information available to HR officials in my Department, the person in question applied on the 27<sup>th<\/sup>of August 2018 for a transfer to Zone 16, which includes a number of Departments of which one is my Department&rsquo;s Athlone office.

(SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  I would inform the Deputy that NEPS provides guidelines, resource materials and support for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect pupils and school staff. The guidelines \"Responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines for Schools and resource Materials for Schools\" refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. It also outlines how schools can plan for crises. <\/p>  <p>  A Critical Incident is defined as an incident, or series of events, that overwhelms the normal coping mechanism of the school. The kinds of critical incidents experienced by schools includes suicide or suspected suicide, death due to violence, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of a member of the school community.  The ultimate aim of the process is to return the school to normality.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines focus upon alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incident. In relation to suicide advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches. <\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines offer a practical step by step guide to schools in how to respond effectively when a critical incident occurs in order to minimise the potential traumatic effect on the school community. It includes templates, advice and information on how to set up a Critical Incident Management Team and develop a Critical Incident Management Plan.  Training has been provided by NEPS staff to primary and secondary schools in relation to this process.<\/p>  <p>  During a critical incident NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at the schools following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff and pupils. Depending on the nature, context and severity of the traumatic incident NEPS staff will also assist school authorities in the co-ordination of supports with broader community based services. All such requests are responded to, most usually by the psychologist normally assigned to the affected school but also in some cases, depending on the particular context, accompanied by a colleague within the NEPS region.

These provisions relate to the appointment of the interim Secretary to the Council, and the process of identifying and recommending to the Government people who are suitable for appointment to be lay members of the Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee, the Judicial Conduct Committee and panels of inquiry.  An interim Secretary was appointed on 11 September 2019, with the appointment of a permanent Secretary being a matter for the Council when established.<\/p>  <p>  I will now address the Deputy's queries in respect of the complaints procedure around Judicial Conduct, and the date these procedures will come into effect. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, in terms of the sequence for implementation, the Judicial Council Act provides for the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee not later than 6 months following the first meeting of the Judicial Council.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the complaint procedures, the Judicial Conduct Committee will consider complaints and refer them for resolution by informal means or undertake investigations into the conduct of individual judges in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act.  A complaint may be made by any person who is directly affected by, or who has witnessed, the alleged misconduct and, in general, there is a 3-month window within which a complaint alleging judicial misconduct may be made.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding when the positions for lay members of the committees will be advertised, a date has yet to be set but recruitment competitions for lay members will be advertised, in due course.  The establishment of the committees on which the lay members will sit is dependent on the establishment date for the Judicial Council and when its first meeting is held (timelines for establishment of each committee are set out in the Judicial Council Act 2019). <\/p>  <p>  Costs for the Judicial Council will include accommodation, staffing and establishment day. Budgetary provision is currently being considered.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked if I will make a statement in relation to the  appointment process of the President of the High Court.  The Deputy has indicated, however,  that these matters have been referred to the European Court of Human Rights to be adjudicated upon (i.e. the matters are sub-judice).  As such, it would not be appropriate for me to comment.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the matters raised in question seven, the Judicial Conduct Committee will consist of 13 members - the Chief Justice (who will be the chairperson of the Committee) and Presidents of the Courts, 3 elected judges (8 judges in total) and 5 lay members.  The Government will appoint 5 lay members to the Committee based on recommendations from the Public Appointments Service.  The Act specifies the categories of persons who are not eligible to be lay members of the Committee.  These include a member of either House of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or a local authority, a judge or a former judge, a practicing barrister or solicitor and a civil servant.  If a person appointed as a lay member subsequently falls into one of these categories, he or she ceases to be a member of the Committee.  Not fewer than 40% of the lay members appointed to the Judicial Conduct Committee shall be women.<\/p>  <p>  The function of the Judicial Conduct Committee shall be to promote and maintain high standards of conduct among judges, having regard to the principles of judicial conduct requiring judges to uphold and exemplify judicial independence, impartiality, integrity, propriety (including the appearance of propriety), competence and diligence and to ensure equality of treatment to all persons before the courts.  <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for the possibility of an investigation (subject to conditions set out in the Act) of alleged judicial misconduct in the absence of a complaint or after the withdrawal of a complaint.

The US concern was that Airbus were receiving unfair subsidies from these Member States regarding the production of its civilian aircraft and that these subsidies were damaging to a direct competitor, US aircraft manufacturing firm Boeing.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel, on 27 June 2005, the EU made its own request to the WTO for consultations citing Boeing&rsquo;s receipt of unfair subsidies from both federal and state level authorities in the US.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 May 2018 the WTO Appellate Body found in favour of the US\/Boeing - that Airbus were receiving unfair subsidies from EU Member States. Subsequently, a WTO arbitrator evaluated the claim and reported on the 2 October 2019 that the value of countermeasures that the US can impose commensurate with the adverse effects caused by EU subsidies is $7.496 billion. In the parallel Boeing case, the WTO arbitrator&rsquo;s report is due for finalisation and publication in 6-9 months&rsquo; time &ndash; Q2 2020.<\/p>  <p>  On the same day as the WTO Arbitrators' Findings were released, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) published its final list of products that will be targeted with new tariffs. The list has 15 sub-sections with Ireland, along with other EU Member States, included in 9 of these sub-sections. The new tariffs can be introduced once the US obtains \"authorisation\" from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DBS) at the next scheduled DSB meeting and my Department understand that a special sitting of the DSB has been arranged for 14 October 2019 to fulfil this procedural requirement.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to impacts, latest CSO data shows that Ireland recorded goods exports to the US of approximately &euro;39.27 billion in 2018. The US is Ireland&rsquo;s largest goods export market, accounting for 28% of total goods exports in 2018. For the period January to June 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s total goods trade with the US was recorded as in the region of &euro;22.2 billion. This was an increase of 14% of the same period in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  For those products effected by the USTR list, Ireland exported approximately &euro;362m worth of goods to the US in 2018, with the principal exports being: <\/p>  <p>  - liqueurs and cordials valued at &euro;168.5m, <\/p>  <p>  - butter valued at &euro;156.8m and <\/p>  <p>  - cheddar cheese valued at &euro;37.3m. <\/p>  <p>  Exports of these products will attract an additional 25% tariff on entry into the US. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with industry to fully understand the potential impacts these measures will have.  We are also fully engaged with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our Enterprise Agencies in relation to the implications for Irish business.  <\/p>  <p>  As International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties, the EU Commission takes the lead on this issue taking into account the views of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  Therefore, Ireland continues to be engaged with the Commission, both at a Ministerial and Official level on these issues. Indeed, as recently as Tuesday last (1st October), I attended an EU Council of Trade Ministers&rsquo; meeting in Brussels where, among other items, we discussed our concerns on these Aircraft cases and I articulated Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns.  I also held a bilateral meeting with Trade Commissioner-elect Phil Hogan while in Brussels at which we discussed the WTO Airbus and Boeing cases and the potential impact the imposition of tariffs on Ireland would have. <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission confirmed for Member States that is has consistently communicated to the US that the EU is ready to work with them to agree on a fair and balanced solution for our respective aircraft industries.  As recently as this July, the EU shared concrete proposals with the US for a new regime on aircraft subsidies, and a way forward on existing compliance obligations on both sides, to avoid a round of tit-for-tar tariffs as the EU will have a similar option against the US in some 6\/9 months when an Arbitrator determines the quantum of damage to EU industry US subsidies to Boeing has caused. So far, regretfully, the US has not engaged. Nonetheless, Ireland&rsquo;s preference, as I and my Government colleagues as well as my officials have articulated, along with the EU, is for a negotiated settlement to be reached on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Government has also highlighted our concerns in bilateral engagements with US interlocuters in Dublin and Washington, intensively over recent months. The issue of the tariffs was also raised during the US Presidential and Vice-Presidential visits this year.  I and my officials, as well as colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, continue in contact with our US counterparts in Dublin and Washington on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Our position remains that the mutual imposition of sanctions will only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.

These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.<\/p><p>ITI Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000\/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland also recently launched 12 &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  The Brexit Essentials campaign highlights the key questions and documentation that businesses need to address in order to trade successfully with the UK post 31 October.<\/p><p>My Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and key industry partners, also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative called Clear Customs comprises of a training programme and a customs financial support to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to customs roles.<\/p><p>In addition, the Government has held over 100 Brexit information seminars and events since last September. I also have been convening regular roundtable discussions with the main retail grocery and distribution players since December to better understand contingency planning within the sector on food supply. Revenue, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Dublin Port and relevant Government Departments also attend these meetings.<\/p><p>With the deadline for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU fast approaching, the continued uncertainty around Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit, to know my Department and its agencies are here to help.<table><tr><th>Scheme<\/th><th>Uptake (27 September 2019)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme<\/td><td>816 applications received, 738 approved   by SBCI, 194 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;43.52 million.Of the approved applications to date, 153 were reapplications as eligibility expires after four months.(Uptake as of 27 September)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Future Growth Loan Scheme<\/td><td>1,353 applications received, 1,283   approved by SBCI, 270 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level   to a value of &euro;43.805 million.(Uptake as of 27 September)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to   self-assess their exposure to Brexit<\/td><td>6,585 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 1,596 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Be Prepared Grant<\/td><td>216 Be Prepared Grants have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new  markets<\/td><td>194 companies have been approved under this initiative[1]<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Prepare to Export Scorecard<\/td><td>4,746 Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Customs Insights Online Course<\/td><td>1,706 Customs Insights Course participants<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding<\/td><td>60 Agile Innovation projects have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Brexit Advisory Clinics<\/td><td>16 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over 1,200 in attendance<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of   a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients   address weaknesses and improve resilience<\/td><td>288 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have   been completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland   Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire   a strategic consultant for a set period<\/td><td>1,088 Strategic Consultancy   Grants have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Clear   Customs Grant<\/td><td>168 applications have been made to access financial support through the scheme<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office   Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO   clients to explore and develop new market opportunities<\/td><td>729   clients  were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office   LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration   between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer   for LEO micro enterprise clients<\/td><td>423   LEO   clients have participated in the programme<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring<\/td><td>1,017 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office   Brexit Seminars\/Events<\/td><td>5,637 Participants at the Brexit Information events  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Customs Training   Participants<\/td><td>917 Participants attended Customs Training<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit   Advisory Service<\/td><td>4,551 SMEs   have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.

The findings of a survey, done by B&amp;A on behalf of my Department in February 2019, suggest that planning for Brexit is increasing with almost 50% of SME's reporting having taken some form of active engagement (up from 42% in 2018) in the form of planning or other mitigating steps. <\/p>  <p>  Among the most impacted businesses, progress is also being made, for example more than half of exporters indicate that they have a Brexit plan while 70% of exporting and importing companies have taken mitigating actions to address possible Brexit challenges. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) clients are actively planning for Brexit. According to an International Markets Week client survey 86% of client companies are now taking actions to prepare for the impact of Brexit. This is up from 38% in 2017.

The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  Receivers are appointed under a relevant security e.g. a mortgage or a charge which contains the contractual terms in relation to their appointment and their powers under the instrument. <\/p>  <p>  Receivers can also be appointed over property under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 in the case of mortgages created after 1 December 2009, and the Conveyancing Act 1881 for mortgages created prior to that date. This legislation falls within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. <\/p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 contains provisions in relation to the receiver of the property of a company. The Act does not have application in relation to the appointment of receivers to properties owned by natural persons or other types of entity.<\/p>  <p>  Section 437 of the Companies Act 2014 confers statutory powers on receivers and is intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures.  However, section 437 (4) makes clear that these powers are limited by any provision in the instrument under which the receiver was appointed, again underlying the essentially contractual nature of receivership. <\/p>  <p>  A receiver will have the right to secure and sell the property the subject of the debenture so that the debt to the lender can be repaid.  However, section 437(5) of the Act provides that the conferral of powers in relation to the property of a company does not affect any rights in relation to that property of any other person.   <\/p>  <p>  When selling the property of a company, a receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 of the Companies Act 2014 which provides that: <\/p>  <p>  (i) receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and <\/p>  <p>  (ii) the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of  requisite value to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her. <\/p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty &ldquo;to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;. Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred. Civil proceedings may be brought to enforce this duty. <\/p>  <p>  I consider that these statutory obligations on receivers when selling charged assets are sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800072#WRH04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800072#WRH04100"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[40715\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800072#WRH04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of meetings she and her two immediate predecessors had with the national SME envoy of Ireland in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019 by date in tabular form.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":492,"content":"<p>The SME Envoy Network was established in 2011, as part of the review at that time of the EU&rsquo;s Small Business Act.

Furthermore, many of the newer products being licensed are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system.    <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislative underpinning of the Health Act is backed up by the Framework Agreement on the Supply of Medicines 2016-2020 signed between the State and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA).  It is expected to deliver approximately &euro;600 million in savings from IPHA companies over the four-year lifetime of the Agreement and &euro;150 million in savings from non-IPHA companies. This Agreement contains a number of measures intended to increase sustainable drug access and supply.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the IPHA Agreement and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland. The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. Among the initiatives being pursed are improvements in practices for the procurement of drugs in hospitals and the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars.  <\/p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years, with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800073#WRJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Expenditure","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800073#WRJ02800"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[40531\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800073#WRJ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated spend on medicines in 2019, in tabular form.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":554,"content":"<p>The HSE National Service Plan net budget allocation for 2019 is &euro;16,050m.

The legislation governing the Statute of Limitations comes within the area of responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Specific time frames are defined under the Statute of Limitations within which litigation can be brought.

The overall operation of the law in relation to the Statute of Limitations is complex and any changes to it would have a wide impact in law.

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. <\/p>  <p>  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  <\/p>  <p>  While it is none the less important to note that eligibility for a medical card remains primarily on the basis of financial assessment, I do recognise that patients require a responsive and efficient health system to meet their medical needs, which may often be required urgently. With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are promptly issued on receipt of an application, which includes a medical report, from a health care professional involved in the person&rsquo;s care. <\/p>  <p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are valid for six months with a means test required before the end of this period for the person and their family, where applicable. Emergency medical cards granted in cases of terminal illness are not means tested or subject to review. <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to note that since 1 July 2015, the HSE adopted the position that all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.

On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme, which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second level education (generally 12 to 13 year olds), to a programme that also offers the vaccination to boys in their first year of secondary school. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:<\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;<\/p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    <\/p>  <p>  Extending the HPV vaccine to boys will also provide direct protection to boys against HPV-related disease.  It also provides indirect herd protection to girls who have not been vaccinated.  Another important factor includes the additional protection provided by a gender neutral programme to vulnerable groups (for example, men who have sex with men) and the potential to improve the resilience of the immunisation programme to fluctuations in vaccine uptake and to the movement of individuals into and out of the country.<\/p>  <p>  For older children who did not receive the vaccine as part of the School Immunisation Programme the HPV vaccine can only be obtained privately from a GP.  If your child is 15 years of age or older they will require three doses of the HPV vaccine in order to be fully protected.

In order to assess the potential impact, the local fishing industry is invited to submit a Fisheries Natura Plan for assessment and consideration.

As this area had been previously deemed unsuitable for fishing by industry it had not been the subject of screening for appropriate assessment in the first instance.  The local industry was invited, if it wished, to have this area considered for fishing activity, to submit an amendment to the Fisheries Natura Plan to be screened and, if necessary, undergo appropriate assessment.  <\/p><p>With assistance from BIM, the amendment was submitted to my Department on 17 September and referred to the Marine Institute for screening.  The results of the screening report identified that the characteristics of the seed bed fall within the parameters of the Appropriate Assessment that was carried out on the Fisheries Natura Plan in 2016 and that a further assessment of the amendment to the Plan was not necessary.Accordingly, I adopted the amendment to the Plan and I directed that the reasons for this decision and the related documents be published online.

This equates to a cut of approximately 5% to the CAP budget in the next MFF period 2021 - 2027.  I have previously stated that the proposed cut is unacceptable for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Negotiations on the MFF proposals have commenced and are running in parallel to the CAP post-2020 negotiations. The MFF is a critical matter for all Member States and its agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council.  It is clear that there are divergent views among Member States on the appropriate level for the budget.  While some Member States (including Ireland) have indicated their willingness to increase their contributions once they contribute towards areas of added European value, there are others who feel equally strongly that the current proposals, such as they are, are too costly.  <\/p>  <p>  Brexit further compounds the budgetary issue, with some &euro;12 billion per annum in UK net contributions being removed from the budget post-2020.  <\/p>  <p>  I continue to work at building consensus among my agriculture colleagues in Europe with regard to maintaining the CAP budget. In May last year, I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid, which calls for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post-2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.

Anglers and fishery owners were asked to report incidences of salmon with rash like symptom to help determine the scale of the problem nationally.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by IFI that salmon first began appearing in Irish rivers with these symptoms in early June and by mid-June, there were reports of fish with ulceration in at least six rivers, both on the east and west coast of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The affected salmon show signs of bleeding, ulceration and haemorrhaging mainly along the area on the belly of the fish and on the head and the tail. Secondary fungal infection can set in and be fatal. IFI advised that until the cause of the disease was determined and the risk of spreading the disease established, affected salmon should not be removed from the water. Anglers who captured salmon with these symptoms were advised to follow normal biosecurity procedures and disinfect tackle, waders and equipment.<\/p>  <p>  IFI set up a dedicated email (salmon.symptoms@fisheriesireland.ie) for anglers to report any incidence of diseased salmon encountered in Irish rivers and provide photographs. Anglers were also advised to contact Inland Fisheries Ireland&rsquo;s 24 hour confidential hotline number on 1890 34 74 24 or 1890 FISH 24 in this regard. Inland Fisheries Ireland collaborated with the Fish Health Unit in the Marine Institute in Galway and provided, for disease testing, a live salmon with symptoms of the disease captured in the upstream trap from the National Salmonid Index Catchment on the river Erriff. <\/p>  <p>  A freshly caught salmon with disease symptoms was also provided from the river Lee for disease testing. Salmon were also collected from the River Boyne by IFI staff and given to specialist fish veterinary group in Galway for examination. No responsible disease was identified in any of these samples that could explain the symptoms observed in Irish and other salmon.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of reports of disease salmon were from June and July with small numbers of reported incidences since that time. Analysis also suggests that the number of fish which died from the disease was small with east coast rivers such as those in the North East appearing to be most affected. <\/p>  <p>  Given the international dimension to the issue, IFI scientists consulted with their colleagues in Norway and Scotland since early June in an effort to establish the cause of the disease. To date no laboratory in Europe has definitively identified the cause of the disease symptoms observed although it is thought that there may be some link to a change in salmon diet at sea and a related vitamin deficiency which is being investigated further as a possible contributing factor. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, an IFI scientist will attend an international workshop in Norway shortly and present the available information on the disease outbreak in Ireland. The workshop will cover exchange of observations and knowledge about the disease between countries, results of disease testing and the identification of knowledge gaps and potential future collaboration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800080#WRQ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries Regulation","counter":1062,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800080#WRQ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[40576\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800080#WRQ03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the way in which the process of appropriate certification from a professional engineer works in terms of Inland Fisheries Ireland instream enhancement works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1064,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[40577\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800080#WRQ03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the process of appropriate certification from a professional engineer works in terms of Inland Fisheries Ireland instream enhancement works became part of policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1065,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 and 370 together.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in reply to a number of previous Questions, planning is a matter for the planning authorities and planning requirements are set out in the various Planning Acts and regulations.

This has been amended inter alia to reflect successive EU energy regulation legislative packages. In this regard, the EU Energy acquis, including the recently negotiated Clean Energy Package, continues to shape the design, operation and regulation of the Irish electricity and gas wholesale and retail markets. <\/p>  <p>  In line with those packages, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets in Ireland is solely a matter for the statutory independent energy regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the electricity market following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. <\/p>  <p>  Consistent with European energy regulation policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. The CRU ended its regulation of retail market prices for electricity in 2011 and for gas in 2014. The position of successive Governments is that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Government policy on energy costs is focused on supporting the competitive market to drive down prices and supports for energy efficiency. Data from approved price comparison sites, Bonkers.ie, Switcher.ie and Power to Switch.ie show that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers. A reversion to regulatory electricity and gas retail market price controls would not be consistent with either national or EU energy regulatory policy. Accordingly any such proposals for the CRU in that regard are not being considered.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its statutory functions, including under SI 630\/2011, the CRU carries out various market monitoring and reporting functions in association with its responsibility to ensure that the market operates competitively for the benefit of the consumer. Under the SI, the CRU may take actions that it considers necessary to ensure that final customers benefit from competition in the supply of electricity and gas. It also published two reports in this regard in 2017, in line with an action in the 2015 Energy Policy White Paper. The first report was a consumer focussed assessment of the development of competition in retail markets and its impact on prices . The CRU then followed up with an analysis of energy supply costs to understand the drivers for changes in supply costs and increase transparency around these costs. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the CRU is accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800080#WRQ05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1082,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800080#WRQ05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1083,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[40783\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800080#WRQ05900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the date for his forthcoming meeting with the chief executives of the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na to set out a future direction for a power station (details supplied) following the refusal of planning by An Bord Plean&aacute;la; when he last held a meeting with each chief executive on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1084,"content":"<p>I met the Chief Executives of ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na on 26 July 2019 following the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision with regard to West Offaly Power Station.

The target date for the auction bidding process is June 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the RESS, subsidy free renewable energy through corporate power purchase agreements provide a route to market for renewable project developers in the shorter term providing them with a real opportunity to boost Ireland's renewable energy capacity in advance of the commencement of RESS. The Climate Plan commits to a 15% target for the renewable industry to develop projects through subsidy free corporate power purchase agreements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800081#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Regulation","counter":1110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800081#WRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1111,"qnumday":389,"qnumall":"[41009\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800081#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on whether the regulatory framework, including network development, operation and delivery plans for connecting renewable energy sources are adequate to deliver on the 2030 70% renewable electricity ambition and therefore reducing the cost of fines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1112,"content":"<p>The regulatory framework for the Irish electricity market is mainly contained in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, as amended.

The personal rate of payment of PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction, regarding their capacity for work, whether the person was in receipt of Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and their current rate of payment.  After the medical assessment, if a person's disability is rated as moderate, severe  or profound their previous payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% per cent, respectively. <\/p><p>The PCB scheme extends the welfare system by explicitly recognising and responding to the reality that some people with disabilities will have a capacity to engage in open market employment while continuing to receive some income support from the State.

In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, legislation passed in 2011 provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be decided on research into life expectancy. <\/p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  It is the only feasible solution which does not involve reducing pension rates to pensioners (which would result in poverty among older people), or reducing other significant areas of Government expenditure (such as other payments made by my Department). <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and so the question of claiming a social protection payment would not arise.  Where this is not possible and a person loses their employment before reaching State pension age, they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.   <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800084#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Data","counter":1309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800084#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1310,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[40629\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800084#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons referred to Turas Nua and Seetec for JobPath to date; the number of persons to date that have gained employment through the JobPath service; the number of persons that have been employed for over a year on JobPath; the number employed after two years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1311,"content":"<p>The primary purpose of JobPath is to provide a case management based, employment advice and counselling service to long term unemployed jobseekers.

It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service.

Decisions regarding particular developments and any tenure mix for new housing on local authority land are, in the first instance, a matter for each local authority, including its elected members.<\/p>  <p>  Mixed-tenure developments are an important policy objective in Rebuilding Ireland and uphold the principle of sustainable mixed communities.  These developments also provide an opportunity to see major sites developed more quickly, and integrated into existing communities and areas.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens site, I understand that an exhaustive process has been undertaken over the last number of years to allow Dublin City Council to identify the current delivery model as the most effective way to develop the site, from a mixed tenure perspective and in terms of financial viability. Following a decision by Council members, the Council's intention is to provide 768 new homes, comprising a tenure mix which includes 411 private homes, 192 social homes and 165 homes which will be sold at prices which are discounted on open market values to make them more affordable. <\/p>  <p>  While the final price points on the discounted homes have yet to be fully determined and are being put to the elected members for consideration,  I understand that it is intended that the average price of new homes will be in the region of &euro;300,000 and prices will not exceed &euro;320,000.  Such provision would obviously allow many households and families, who would not otherwise be able to do so, to purchase homes and establish themselves within the community of their choice in this city centre location.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to St Michael&rsquo;s Estate, this is one of two Cost Rental &lsquo;pathfinder&rsquo; projects (the other being Enniskerry Road in Sandyford).  A core objective of the Cost Rental model is to offer more moderate income households the choice of a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure. Over the longer term, as homes are delivered at scale, it is envisaged that cost rental will have a stabilising effect on the broader private rented market. The current tenure mix proposed by Dublin City Council for St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate is 30% social housing and 70% cost rental.  While the proposal for the site development has not yet been brought to a conclusion, it is understood that the aforementioned tenure mix will remain over the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with these pilot projects, my Department is developing a national policy approach to Cost Rental as a new form of tenure for Ireland.  This requires that serious consideration is given to the many delivery options possible, and the challenges posed, in order to ensure that a coherent Cost Rental model can be delivered at a scale and in a manner that will have the desired positive impact on the Irish housing sector. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, I have convened a working group within my Department, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other expert bodies. This group is developing the policy framework for the broader Cost Rental model and to consider how a sustainable financing structure can be established to then commence delivery of units at the scale required to get this new category of housing off the ground. The work of this group is being assisted by a consultancy and research support that is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank on our behalf.<\/p>  <p>  The selection of further sites for Cost Rental consideration will be informed largely by the financial and operational model that will emerge from this evidence building. Given the 30% affordability requirement that the Government has agreed must be met on State lands that are to be utilised for housing, including those to be brought forward by the Land Development Agency, I anticipate that Cost Rental will have an important role to play in the development of these lands. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800085#WRV07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Review","counter":1444,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800086#WRW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1445,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[40778\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100800086#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when planned changes to qualification requirements for the tenant purchase scheme will be announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1446,"content":"<p>The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015, provide the basis for the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme for existing local authority houses.

Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  <\/p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters.

To date, funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, has been allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes. <\/p><p>Details of all SSF funded infrastructure projects can be found on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links:  <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>In addition to making discounted homes available for purchase, the Government is also committed to the development of &lsquo;Cost Rental&rsquo; in Ireland. Under the Cost Rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and any financial supports provided by the State\/local authorities.  With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case. <\/p><p>In order to drive delivery, two early mover pilot projects are being advanced, one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and the other at Emmet Road in Inchicore.
