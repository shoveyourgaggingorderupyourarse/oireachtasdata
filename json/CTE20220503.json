The amendment is pretty self-explanatory.  It relates to one of the key principles that I believe should be incorporated at the core of every piece of environmental legislation, or any legislation the Government is implementing at the moment.  That is the principle of just transition.  When we talk about just transition, we are talking about making sure everybody in our country has the ability to make the climate action changes required of them, that they are supported by the Government in doing so and that there is a fundamental addressing of inequalities in our society through these measures.  It is about ensuring we use this opportunity to address any climate or environmental measures to also address inequalities by the actions Government takes, by subsidisation and by any funding or policy measures it introduces.  This amendment brings the principle of just transition into the Bill. <\/p><p>The words &quot;just transition&quot; tend to be used as a catchphrase or for headlines and are bandied about by Members in government in the D&aacute;il.  What do we mean by &quot;just transition&quot;?  There is no definition in any legislation in Ireland of &quot;just transition&quot; or of the responsibilities of the Government in ensuring a just transition.  This definition is based on the one that was used in Scotland and that works in Scotland.<\/p><p>When we tried to get this definition into the climate Bill it was not accepted on the basis that it was too complex to do so.  I say it would be too complex to make our climate adjustments without this &quot;just transition&quot; definition.  This definition gives a tick list of all the things Government should consider when implementing this work.<\/p><p>One thing the Government can learn from recent weeks, specifically the turf issue, is that policies developed without thinking about who they will impact on and the inequalities they could create will be very difficult to get across the line.  I ask that the Government incorporate the definition into this Bill to make sure that, when it develops the Bill and further policies aligned therewith, they are poverty-proofed and disability-proofed, that people who could be impacted in any way are involved in the discussions and that inequalities are addressed in that manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#A00800","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>My amendments Nos. 15 and 17 have been included in this grouping although they are on slightly different topics.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 15 seeks to insert that where targets are being set that we would have, as a minimum targets set &ldquo;in Construction, Food, Clothing and Textiles, Equipment, and other relevant sectors&rdquo;.  Leaving it that targets would be set on a sectoral basis without calling out in the legislation the priority sectors would miss an opportunity to recognise that the really big sectors in terms of their impact on the circular economy are the construction, food, textiles and equipment sectors and probably in that order.  As construction accounts for more than half of our materials use and not far short of half of our waste generated, only 10% of which is recovered in any way for a use other than to go to landfill, we have a really serious problem in construction.<\/p> <p>  Food is a key sector for us.  In terms of managing the material flows and getting fresh thinking, while the food sector has shown signs of change, and is probably ahead of the construction sector in that sense and there is a greater consciousness about the recovery of food waste, it still represents a massively important sector from our point of view.  It is a similar situation for the other sectors that I have named and I could go into details but I do not want to hold up the committee.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 17 refers to lines 30 and 31 on page 10 and that is where the circular economy strategy is expected to set targets in respect of the repair and reuse of products.  My amendment seeks to insert \"improved maintenance and utilisation patterns of products and materials\".  For example, in the transport sector, because 95% of the time the vehicles we have purchased and own are idle, we need to move to sharing platforms that increase the rate of utilisation of these products which will, as a consequence, reduce the material consumption associated with travel.  Similarly, it is possible to improve the maintenance of equipment and achieve much better performance from the materials that we use if maintenance is factored into the arenas where we set targets.  This goes to a deeper problem because I believe the thinking from the Department around this Bill has very much come from the waste end of the pipe.  One of the shifts that we need to see is to start to anticipate and redesign better processes than simply seeking to handle the waste stream in a different way.  That is why sharing platforms or servicisation, as it is called in the literature, is a way to cut down on material use and achieve better outcomes from the materials that we do use.  My amendments differ slightly from the topic that Deputy Whitmore discussed but have been grouped with these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#B00100","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Yes, the Bills Office has grouped all of these amendments together and I understand that there is a rationale for that.

There is not a huge amount of detail as to extent of the committee and its role.  I ask the Minister to use the Public Appointments Service process for this committee and, indeed, any committee that the Minister seeks to establish for the purpose of advising on specific issues like this one.  My amendment outlines some of the things that I believe should be taken into consideration such as gender, expertise and expresses the need for the process to be a public and transparent one.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 37 seeks to insert the provision that funds \"will be ringfenced for the Circular Economy Fund\".  We need to make sure that all funds are ring-fenced and it is an issue that concerns the carbon tax.

To my mind, these amendments have the same effect.  I note that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is not here to propose her amendment but Deputy O'Rourke is here to propose amendment No. 13, which proposes that the targets should be mandatory or that there must be targets within the circular economy strategy, with which I agree.<\/p> <p>  I had planned to accept amendment No. 14 but as the Deputy is not here then I will flag that for amendment on Fourth Stage.  Amendment No. 14 is stronger than amendment No. 13 as it seeks to insert the word \"shall&rdquo;.  So the targets \"shall\" be there and, therefore, must be there immediately rather than waiting six months as stated in amendment No. 13.<\/p><p>I propose to put Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendment No. 14 into effect on Report Stage.  <\/p><p> In general, I appreciate and acknowledge the supportive approach members have taken to this Bill and all the ideas that have been expressed.  In that spirit, I am planning to accept as many of the amendments as I can and to rewrite for the next Stage those I cannot accept.  <\/p><p> Turning to amendment No. 15, in the name of Deputy Bruton, I understand the intention in specifying sectors with particular reference to the circular economy.  I listened to the Deputy's contribution in this regard and I wish to put this amendment into effect, but first I wish to consult with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel regarding the exact wording.  Subject to that advice, I will reintroduce this amendment on Report Stage.<\/p><p> Moving to amendment No. 17, also in the name of Deputy Bruton, this makes a key contribution to the provisions of the Bill in respect of &ldquo;improved maintenance and utilisation patterns of products and materials&rdquo;.  The Deputy makes a good case.  Again, I want to get the wording right and I will be consulting with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in this regard.  Therefore, I am not going to accept the amendment today, but I commit to reintroducing it on Report Stage, once consultation with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has been completed.<\/p><p> I note the intention of amendment No. 16, in the name of Deputy Devlin.  It refers to &ldquo;reductions in plastic single-use items according to the waste hierarchy within EU Waste Directive 2008\/98 and Commission Implementation Regulation (EU) 2020\/2151 Single Use plastic Directive&rdquo;.  This legislation, however, is concerned with moving away from single use across all areas and not just plastic.  Additionally, reductions in single-use plastics specifically are being adequately dealt with under the single-use plastics directive at an EU level.  The directive came into force last July and banned ten of the most common single-use plastic items that wash up on beaches.  Therefore, I am not planning to accept this amendment.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 1 and 18 are in the name of Deputy Whitmore, and I thank her for her contributions.  As she pointed out, the definition of a &ldquo;just transition&rdquo; was discussed in the debate on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.  Many definitions were proposed.  One came from the Minister and another from Deputy Whitmore or other Deputies.  Agreement was not reached on the wording of a definition, so it was decided there would be no definition of &ldquo;just transition&rdquo;.  Consequently, I am loath to put such a definition into this legislation and then have it affect the other legislation without consulting first with the drafters of that Act.  Later, however, I intend to accept amendment No. 11, which Deputy Whitmore has also submitted, that will place an obligation on the Minister to consider the national disability inclusion strategy and the roadmap for social inclusion when drafting the circular economy strategy.  This will give effect to some of the intentions behind Deputy Whitmore&rsquo;s amendments.  Therefore, I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 1 and 18.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 19, in the names of Deputies O'Rourke and Cronin, relates to &ldquo;how to achieve greater harmonisation of civic amenity site services in terms of opening hours, materials accepted, accessibility, tariffs charged and an examination of the co-location of these facilities with co-operative and social enterprises such as Men&rsquo;s Sheds&rdquo;.  These are detailed operational elements concerning how civic amenity sites will function in each local authority area.  In fact, waste management planning relating to infrastructural provision, such as civic amenity sites, is the responsibility of local authorities under Part 2 of the Waste Management Act 1996.  The waste action plan for a circular economy, launched by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in September 2020, contains a commitment to \"formalise the role of civic amenity sites and [to] agree a standard list of waste streams to be accepted at [such] sites\".  The regional waste management planning offices, with support from the Department, have recently published a national review of civic amenity sites.  This review is available online.  Discussions have commenced with the local authority sector on the implementation of the report's recommendations and these will allow civic amenity sites to play a greater role in our transition to a more circular economy through measures such as co-ordinated education and awareness programmes, greater use of reuse schemes, standardising a list of waste streams accepted at such sites and collective approaches to extended producer responsibility schemes.  That will assist in continuing to reduce the amount of waste disposed of in landfills.  Considering those factors, I am not proposing to accept this amendment.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 26 to 29, inclusive, are in the name of Deputy Whitmore.  I am sympathetic to the intentions behind these amendments.  The Deputy raised some key points on Second Stage and that is why I will accept amendment No. 11 later.  Regarding amendment No. 28, however, I do not believe it is necessary to specify that protection of the environment includes protection of biodiversity.  Biodiversity protection is already provided for in the current draft of this section, and there is no question about that.  I cannot see how &ldquo;environment&rdquo; could not include &ldquo;biodiversity&rdquo;.  By separating those terms, and referring to &ldquo;environment&rdquo; and &ldquo;biodiversity&rdquo; as if they were different things, I would worry that at other points in legislation where &ldquo;environment&rdquo; is referred to, that could be then understood as not including &ldquo;biodiversity&rdquo;.  I hope this point is clear.  Therefore, I am not accepting amendment No. 28.<\/p><p> This is also the case in respect of amendment No. 27.  I believe the current wording already allows support for these kinds of initiatives.  I am also not going to accept amendment No. 26, but I am sympathetic to its intention.  I would like to take advice regarding whether the current wording might narrow the scope of what is currently a broadly-drafted provision.  My concern is that while I would support providing assistance to &ldquo;communities which are disadvantaged and marginalised&rdquo;, I would also like to ensure that the amendment does not limit support under the provision for all communities.  I would also like to take advice on how to define &ldquo;marginalised&rdquo; and &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; communities and whether this is necessary.  Based on the outcome of those discussions, I may reintroduce the amendment on Report Stage.  I am also not accepting amendment No. 29 because I believe it is disproportionate in the circumstances and could have the unintended consequence of delaying the establishment of a committee under this section.  The Minister does not even need to form a committee.<\/p><p> Regarding amendment No. 37, I have been advised that the legislation already provides that the moneys generated from the environmental levies will be paid into the circular economy fund and will be used for those purposes.  Therefore, this legislation specifically ring-fences all the money collected for those purposes, and those purposes are specified.  What this amendment seeks to achieve is already contained in this legislation.  Section 8(7) of the Bill states that &ldquo;in accordance with, [regulations under] section 11(1)\", which relate to the environmental levies, \"there shall be paid into the Circular Economy Fund the amounts specified in those regulations&rdquo;.  Section 12(3)(n) of the Bill provides that the regulations under section 11(1) may provide for &ldquo;the payment into the Circular Economy Fund [...] of amounts received by [the collection authority] [...] on account of the levy (subject to the deduction [...] [of] expenses incurred [in the] [...] collection the levy)\".  The drafting of these sections is based on the drafting of the provisions which provided for the environment fund.  In the previous legislation, that environment fund ring-fenced the proceeds of the plastic bag and landfill levies.  Those levies have operated effectively since 2002.  Therefore, we have 20 years of experience of seeing a ring-fenced fund in operation, and this will be a continuation of that.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the intention behind this amendment is already provided for in the Bill and therefore I am not accepting amendment No. 37.<\/p><p> Turning to amendment No. 67, this inserts a definition of \"just transition\" into the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  Section 4(8)(k) of that Act provides that the Government must have regard to \"the requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy which endeavours, in so far as is practicable, to maximise employment opportunities, and support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition\".  That Act does not define the term \"just transition\" and I do not believe it is appropriate to introduce that definition into the Act under the auspices of this legislation, so I am not accepting this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#B00700","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1651532400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#D00100","aye":["1585","1507","1627"],"nay":["1549","1481","1562","1594","1545","1479"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Sections 3 to 5, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>SECTION 6<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith but I do not think she is present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#E00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Is it grouped with other amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#E00600","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, are grouped and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#E00700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 7, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;(a)  the supply chain and processes of production and distribution of products and services are redesigned in order to minimise the environmental damage,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>This is a fairly important point.  The way the Minister is defining &quot;circular economy&quot; is quite limited.  It is about materials being kept in use, the maximum value being extracted from them and their recovery at the end of their useful life.  It omits both the choice of the right materials in the first place and the importance of design in ensuring all these principles are observed.  The failure to look right back to the design point in the supply chain is going to mean we fall short.  I contend one of the weaknesses in the way this Bill was conceived is it is very much taking a limited view of the materials and their ending up in waste, whereas I believe the biggest delivery for the circular economy will be in rethinking design.  For example, I have mentioned already the case of motor cars where if you can redesign the thinking to sell travel as a service instead of cars as a product to be kept idle in a driveway, then you can dramatically change the material use and the whole conception of how the supply chain should work and its capacity to minimise environmental damage.  It is therefore important we create the signal that we expect producers to go back to first principles and look afresh at the way they designed their sector and the materials it uses, as well as the more limited objective of keeping materials in use for as long as possible, maximising their extraction of value and recovering them.  It is a slightly wider definition but when the Minister comes to look at individual sectors and devise strategies for individual sectors he will appreciate the value of forcing the issue of design into the thinking as the first principle that should be addressed in any sectoral approach.  That is the thinking behind my amendment.<\/p><p>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has tabled another amendment but it is weaker than mine because mine forces producers to think about the correct selection of materials.  Often, if the wrong material is being used, if it is one that damages biodiversity or has other environmental downsides to it, then simply looking at the entire supply chain will not be enough.  If you look at the entire supply chain from design onwards and at potential environmental damage at any point in that, you will get a broader concept.  I suggest it is less divisive looking at even the climate challenge in this context where we know there is an awful lot of division in Ireland, especially in rural areas, about climate being an imposition.  If you look at redesigning whole sectors for a bright and fulfilling future, you get a much better political approach, as well as being more correct in the theoretical approach as well.  I leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#E00800","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Do Deputies O'Rourke, Cronin and Whitmore wish to speak to amendment No. 4?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#E00900","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>It is appropriate amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, are grouped because they are variations on the same theme, namely, the definition of circular economy.

It is absolutely critical we get this right because the circular economy is mentioned all the way through the Bill so any kind of change that introduces an ambiguity or has a loophole or flaw may weaken other sections.  I reviewed the report that came from the committee on the definition of the circular economy and considered it carefully.  The definition of \"circular economy\" in the published Bill was drafted in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and with the Attorney General.  His view was the phrase that is in the legislation, namely, \"an economic model and the policies and practices which give effect to that model\" includes all the items referenced in the amendments, including things like the supply chain, distribution, the process of production and so on through the words \"policies and practices\".<\/p> <p>  The definition we put in the Bill is based on the most common internationally used and readily understood definition of the circular economy and is combined with references to resource consumption and environmental harm.  Those were put in to reflect the recommendations of the committee.  My fear is that introducing this will bring in ambiguity and weaken other sections.  The view of the Department is that references to \"supply chain\", \"stage of the supply chain\", \"processes of production\" and so on did not meaningfully expand the scope of the definition, which was already broad, but resulted in a more complex and potentially ambiguous wording.  To give a simple example of the Department's concern here, does the haulage of materials from point A to point B constitute a stage of the supply chain, a process of distribution or neither?  Would the proposed amendments suggest that absent a redesign of such journeys, the circular economy had not been achieved?  These are the concerns of those I have spoken to and we need to be very careful about redefining the circular economy.  On that basis I am not accepting amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#E01100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I do not agree with the Minister of State but I reserve the opportunity to submit an amendment on Report Stage.  The Minister of State needs to reflect on whether, if the sole objective of \"policies and practices\" is keeping materials in use and extracting the most value from them, this will not embrace the wrong choice of materials in the first place.  It is important a circular economy looks at the materials chosen in the first place and does not take it as given that concrete is the way we build and once we keep the materials used in sector for as long as possible we have fulfilled circularity.  Equally, by not referencing design, which is the concept of the service and what we are trying to do ahead of the materials chosen, we lose an element of this.  Construction, travel and food or nourishment are the three big sectors.<\/p><p>In terms of construction and travel, the design concepts that underpin the way the market works are crucial.  For example, we now assume that construction has to have space for parking a lot of vehicles that are owned.  If we moved to thinking differently about how vehicles are used, we would not have so much underground parking space.  Similarly, if we embraced timber as opposed to concrete, a policy that has been embraced far more in Scotland than here, we would have a different profile of materials used in the sector.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on it.  This is the sort of thing the Attorney General likes to have.  Once there are principles and policies, he is happy and content.  I do not think he has given the time to look at what it is the Minister of State is trying to achieve here.  I ask that the Minister of State goes back and asks the Attorney General to reflect again on some of the quirks of the sectors and the way the Government is trying achieve change in them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#E01200","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I agree that design is the key point when you want to achieve circularity.

I will speak to the three amendments together.  They are from the same area of the Bill on page 16, just on different lines.  Ultimately, this is about stitching in a kind of a polluter pays principle.  My big concern is potentially seeing manufactured products such as single-use cups that are not actually reusable in the long term or are keepable by the consumer.  We are walking ourselves into a bigger problem here.  We have to be cautious, particularly in respect of amendment No. 35.  The Bill currently provides for a sum of not &ldquo;less than &euro;0.20 or more than &euro;1.00&rdquo;.  I am a little bit dubious about whether we should be so prescriptive in primary legislation.  However, that said, we should perhaps put in what is in the amendment, which is &ldquo;less than &euro;.01 or more than &euro;1.00, which would be determined by the total percentage of plastic content within the material of the single-use item.&rdquo;  We have to be conscious that manufacturers may look to substitute for alternative goods, which in the long run is actually not environmentally good, and was said earlier, may have unintended consequences.  I ask the Minister of State to consider those amendments, along with amendments Nos. 34 and 36.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#G00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I appreciate having engaged with the Minister of State on Second Stage about what the intentions are.  However, I can see drawbacks in this particular proposal.  The single-use plastic directive, when it comes to cups, is fairly clear.  We know that in due course, all plastic contained within disposable cups will be removed and then be replaced with the ones that are available here in the Oireachtas and are fully recyclable and compostable and, indeed, the lid is also recyclable.<\/p> <p>  What I want to achieve in the passage of this particular Bill is twofold.  First, I want to reduce the number of single-use items that are entering the market in the first instance, and that disincentivise people from using keep cups like Deputy Burton has in front of him.  I forgot mine today.  In addition, I want to ensure the replacements of the single-use paper cup do not actually come with more embedded carbon than the manufacturing process for this cup.  I am not convinced that the good intentions contained within the Bill as drafted capture that fully.  The reason I say that is because the question is whether, like the plastic bag levy in the past, this will incentivise people to change their use.  To a certain extent, the answer is \"Yes\"  However, on the question of whether it will fully disincentivise people to change the manner in which they buy a cup of coffee, tea, latte or whatever it might be, I think the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Then we are going back to the single-use plastic directive to protect us from unnecessary concentrations of plastic within those cups, that is, the film, the coating and all that sort of stuff, which will be excluded again. An example would be this cup I have to hand, which contains none of those things.  The difficulty I have is that hardened plastic cups, for instance, which are available on the market, cost less to produce than this cup.  The coffee companies, the Starbucks and Insomnias of the world, will simply replace their paper cups with plastic.  I do not think that makes sense.  Applying a levy to it should, in fact, be inverted.  What if the State were to mandate that those retailers discount the price of a cup of coffee, tea or latte, if a person presents a reusable cup?  Many of them already do.  They are doing it voluntarily and are doing it more than by 20 cent.  They are actually doing it to the tune of 30 cent.  The sector already recognises that there are people whom they want to incentivise to use to continue to use their keep cup.  This is a general remark on the section, rather than on the individual amendments.  That would be my take on it.  <\/p> <p>  The other side of it is the argument that biodegradable cups are available in the market and people do not put them into their brown bin or compost heap or whatever it might be.  Again, is it better that a person uses a biodegradable or fully recyclable cup than a heavy plastic cup with a rubber ring around it, which most of them have in order to reduce the conductivity of the plastic and reduce the heat of the cup in the person&rsquo;s hand?  Is it better, from an embedded carbon perspective, that we utilise these paper cups, which are 100% recyclable?  Obviously the lid is a separate issue, but they are available in recyclable and biodegradable forms as well.  I totally understand where the Minister of State is coming from in his ambition to try to change consumer behaviour but there are other ways of doing it that I believe would be more effective.  That is why the general principles of the levy on anything other than a cup that contains plastic is wrong.  We will be far better placed as an Oireachtas and a Government to focus in on what would this incentivise.  Would it disincentivise people from using unsustainable products in the market, as we have referred to over the course of this debate this morning?  I might add that I say all this very respectfully and do not want to force my view on anyone.  However, I believe that if we want to change behaviour, we need to incentivise that change while also keeping an eye on the credentials of the product we are incentivising people to use instead of the single-use plastic cup.<\/p> <p>  I was going to start my contribution by asking what the purpose of the levy is.  Is it to generate income?  Of course the Minister of State was going to say no, the ambition of the idea is to change behaviour.  From a business management perspective and a psychological perspective, one can identify other means of disincentivising people from making bad choices or, often, default choices.  We should be incentivising the sector to disincentivise the use of unsustainable materials in their products, as Deputy Bruton has referred to in prior amendments. <\/p> <p>  I could go on, but I think my point is made.  I would ask the Minister of State to perhaps reflect upon those particular remarks in our ambition to disincentivise unsustainable single-use products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#G00400","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>To start with Deputy Devlin&rsquo;s request that the amendments be sent to the clerk with a list of which amendments I am planning to take, I have done that.  Of course, I might be persuaded otherwise, but there is a list up there.<\/p> <p>  I will address some of Deputy Farrell's comments for a minute.  When we are comparing the sustainability of a plastic cup and a paper cup, for example, we are thinking about how many times it is used.  Clearly, a plastic cup that is used once is less sustainable than one that is used 100 times.  For example, as the Deputy pointed out, we have these very flimsy plastic cups in front of us, and one has to decide then what constitutes a reusable container.  This same challenge faced the plastic bag levy in regard to thin plastic bags and what constitutes long-lasting bags and bags for life.  That was defined in the regulations, with various exemptions for putting in meat or fish and so on.  However, they managed it and it works in practice, and I think we can do the same thing.  It is a fair question about materials, and I suppose it relates to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s earlier question about sustainable materials.  On my reading of the Bill and the advice that I have, I can prescribe various materials to be in or out for use.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked what the goal was.  The goal is not to raise revenue.  It is different from a tax, where the goal is usually to raise revenue.  The goal of this levy is to change behaviour.  The difference between this levy and a tax is that the money is going into a ring-fenced fund to be used to promote the circular economy.  If this levy works, we will not collect any of it because we will have converted people.  That is not an unrealistic prospect.  The plan is to start by levying a fee on a disposable cup and then to ban such cups altogether.  Once they are banned, there is no levy to be collected.  It is a short-term measure to change behaviour.  That is the focus of what we are doing.  I am happy to listen to anything that the Deputy has to say or any suggestion he has on this matter, though.<br\/><br\/>Turning to amendments Nos. 6 and 36, this is a much broader issue than just plastic.  The purpose of the levy is to influence people's behaviour away from single usage, not just of plastic items, but of anything that is used once.  If someone used a mug made out of crockery and then threw it away, it would not make sense.  Some 200 million paper cups are ending up in landfill or incineration.  That is crazy and is similar to when we used to use a large number of plastic bags.  We reduced that usage by more than 90%.  When the plastic bag levy was introduced, paper cups were not a feature.  They are a recent innovation.  Go back a few years more and plastic bags did not exist either.  They are things that arrived and were taken for granted, with millions being used every day before they all end up as waste, either incinerated or put into landfill.<br\/><br\/>In the UK, less than 5% of single-use cups are recycled or composted.  Generally, people use takeaway cups and throw them into bins, where they get mixed up with other items.  They also tend to have some coffee at the bottom, which contaminates other waste.  The likelihood of those cups being composted or recycled is small, even where they are recyclable products.  They also end up as litter on the side of the road.  Our constituents spend a great deal of time collecting them and picking them up.  It is a Sisyphean task.  There is also effectively zero recycling of lids.  They are single-use plastics that do not rot and last a long time.<br\/><br\/>Our objective is to reduce the consumption of all types of disposable cup by inducing people to change their behaviour and switch to using reusable cups.  The objective of the levy is to change behaviour and prevent the continuous and unnecessary use of resources that are required for the production and disposal of single-use items.  Regardless of whether these items are made of paper, plastic or any other material, they go through this entire production process just to be used once and have a few minutes of life.<br\/><br\/>For a cup to be recycled or composted, it must be disposed of correctly.  If not disposed of correctly, it will end up in landfill.  Biodegradable cups are better than a plastic alternative strictly in material terms, but they do not achieve the objective of preventing litter and waste or minimising the use of resources.  In fact, they may be counterproductive because the consumer believes that he or she is making an environmentally responsible choice by drinking out of compostable cups.  Consequently, consumers do not change their behaviour and continue to use single-use items.<br\/><br\/>The Bill would allow for exemptions from the levy for different categories of single-use items, including recyclable or compostable cups.  However, the efficacy or success of a levy or ban is influenced by the exemptions to that ban or levy.  If the exemptions allow for an easy substitution or are too broad, there will be no behavioural change.  I point again to our experience with plastic bags.  I intend to provide for some limited exemptions to the levy in the regulations.  These will be set out in the draft regulations and made available for consultation.  I do not intend to exempt recyclable or compostable cups.  The public consultation process will take place in advance of the introduction of the new levies.  The levy on single-use disposable cups will be the first of the levies, but for any levy that is introduced, there will have to be a public consultation process for the public and industry beforehand.  That is where the exemptions and details will get worked out.  I cannot guess in advance.  I have spoken to caf&eacute;s and we have undertaken some consultation, but until we have the full consultation process, I cannot predict what the outcome will be.<br\/><br\/>I will not be accepting amendment No. 35.  The level at which the levy is set is key.  The amendment proposes that it could be as low as 1 cent.  The levy must be set high enough to induce behavioural change and be sufficient to disincentivise consumption.  I have received a great deal of correspondence from the public and caf&eacute; owners saying that they believed that 20 cent was not enough.  They based this on their experience of what made someone choose item A over item B.  I was surprised because I had believed that 20 cent was high, but that is the feedback that I have received so far.  If the levy's level is not high enough, change will not be effected.  We saw this with the plastic bag levy in 2006.  By that time, the levy had been in place for five years at a time of rapid economic growth.  We then began to see data showing that the sustained reductions in consumption and litter pollution were starting to reverse.  In July 2007, the levy was increased from 15 cent to 22 cent.  There was an immediate drop in consumption.<br\/><br\/>Other jurisdictions around the world have introduced very low levies.  For example, Lithuania and Latvia introduced plastic bag levies like ours but set theirs at 1 cent and 2 cent, respectively.  The data from those countries showed that there was little reduction in consumption.  These empirical data show that setting the levy too low means that you do not succeed.<br\/><br\/>Regarding amendments Nos. 32 and 33, difficult-to-recycle materials are a challenge to a circular economy, but levying individual materials rather than products is unlikely to be effective in combating this.  Often, the problem is where there is a combination of materials in one product.  If you buy a sandwich, its container has cardboard but also plastic because producers want to give you a window through which to see.  It is difficult to recycle that composite product.  It is not the plastic or the paper that is the problem, but the fact that they are glued together into a single item.  Consumers know that, when purchasing a specific type of single-use item like a disposable cup, they cannot be expected to foresee its material composition.  In such circumstances, they could incur the levy in a manner that would be random and arbitrary.  For example, if a sandwich container incurs different levy rates depending on which materials or composites it is made of, we may end up with an arbitrary levy that cannot be understood by the public.  That could undermine public acceptance of and confidence in the measure.<br\/><br\/>We should keep in mind the extended producer responsibility, EPR, model.  Members of the committee are familiar with it.  When someone buys electronic equipment like a toaster or washing machine, he or she pays this fee, which is then used to guarantee that the salesperson will take back the old product.  I am mentioning this because it is an effective means of addressing the challenge of difficult-to-recycle materials.  In packaging, the application of eco-modulated fees places a greater financial burden on producers that place difficult-to-recycle materials on the market.  In other words, they will only get the same money back for recycling that product even when it is a difficult-to-recycle product.  Eco-modulated fees in respect of plastic packaging are being levied through the Repak EPR scheme this year for the first time.  Fees for other packaging materials are being reconfigured according to recycling performance from 2023.  The EPR model provides a better means of achieving the purpose of these amendments.  I will be considering how successful the Repak EPR scheme is this year.  Therefore, I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 32 and 33.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 34 reads:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn page 16, line 23, after &ldquo;available&rdquo; to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;and if the levels of material wastage of the single-use item do not adhere to the principles as outlined in EU Waste Directive 2008\/98 regarding lifecycle justification and the best overall environmental outcome in regard to achieving the lowest carbon dioxide emissions and freshwater consumption&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote><p>This is not necessary because section 11(2) already requires that the level of material wastage associated with a given single-use item or class of items must be considered by the Minister.<\/p><p>Section 11(3) requires that the Minister must satisfy himself or herself that any alternatives to that item are suitable before making regulations to impose a levy on that item.  If there is a single-use item or class of items which results in the lowest level of material wastage over its life cycle, then no alternatives would be suitable for the purposes of the legislation.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 7 provides that \"or other products\" be inserted after \"food\".  This broadens the scope of the Bill and I look favourably on it.  If I can expand it, I will.  It is a significant expansion of the application of the levy and I want to take advice on it because of that.  In that context, I ask Deputy Bruton to withdraw the amendment at this stage and if there are no legal impediments, I will introduce it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#G00500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 7 but have a question on something the Minister of State said.

It has been proposed that we should reduce the number of plastic types that can be used for packaging.  One thing that we can do is ban products.  Section 14 allows for the banning of products, which is what I intend to do later on but that does depend on being compliant with EU law.  Banning a product obviously requires notification to the EU and making sure that we are not interfering with the Single Market.  The banning of PFAS, plastics and so on may be done more effectively through an EU-wide decision.  That said, I do have the power under section 14 to impose a ban but I am required to make a notification.

Furthermore, there is no mention of agriculture, although the word &quot;farm&quot; does appear in references to the farm to fork strategy.  This is surprising because agriculture is an industry that could really lead the way in terms of extending the use of certain products.  Section 7 refers to the circular economy strategy and waste action plan and provides that the Minister must have regard to that strategy.  Within that, there is mention of anaerobic digestion but it only gets the odd reference here and there.  This amendment provides for the inclusion of a references to anaerobic digestion and an anaerobic digestion strategy because Ireland lacks any strategy at all when it comes to anaerobic digestion.  <\/p><p>Anaerobic digestion could play an important role in reducing agricultural emissions, which I acknowledge is not the main concern of this Bill, but it also has a strong role to play in the context of the circular economy.  The benefits of anaerobic digestion very much speak to the circular economy.  It can extend many products that would otherwise just go into the waste stream or into landfill.  I have regularly referenced the example of a relatively small anaerobic digester in Timoleague in west Cork which operates like a co-operative movement.  It serves a small geographical region.  Farmers and some industries in the region feed this anaerobic digester.  It is important to say that they do not feed it with products that are specifically grown for anaerobic digestion but with waste products.  A local piggery, a local chicken farm and a local distillery all have waste products that would otherwise go to waste which are fed into the digester to produce energy.  Indeed, enough energy is produced to generate electricity for a village of approximately 1,000 people, which cannot be dismissed.  <\/p><p>There is potentially an enormous role for anaerobic digestion here and what we really need is a national anaerobic digestion strategy.  Perhaps that does not form part of this Bill but I would ask the Minister of State to make sure that such a strategy is at least referred to in this Bill.  The Bill refers to single-use plastic, CCTV and many other aspects of the circular economy.  Anaerobic digestion is an aspect of the circular economy that, at the very least, needs to be referred to in this legislation, especially as it is referred to in the waste action plan for a circular economy.  It has to form part of our circular economy strategy and if we do not include it, that will be a missed opportunity.  Many other countries in Europe, including the UK, have an anaerobic digestion strategy and it serves them very well.  Anaerobic digestion can play two very important roles in agriculture.  It can reduce agricultural emissions, thus helping to decarbonise agriculture and it can also extend the life of certain products before they go to waste, which is exactly what the circular economy is all about.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#J01400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I support Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.

It seems we have a long way to go to get to the adoption.  Public procurement in Ireland needs some legislative prods to get it to change its pattern.  They tend to wait until some constituent organisation is looking for a procurement with a green tinge to it.  Legislators then respond by producing a framework that embraces this.  We need to get a bit more top-down instead of waiting for a very reactive procurement policy, which I believe is there at the moment.  The emphasis is on short-term value rather than lifetime cost and lifetime impact is not well developed in the public procurement sector.  Perhaps this Bill is an opportunity for the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, to put a little bit of lead in his pencil when he goes across the road to his other responsibilities in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Yes, the bioeconomy is a really important part of the circular economy.  Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out that the cost of fertiliser has tripled.  As we all know, the cost of electricity and gas has gone up also.  One can see that this type of economy is now essential and something that we need to do.  It is undeveloped in Ireland compared to other countries.  When we consider that anaerobic digestion has been going on for many years in Germany, for example, we really have a great opportunity.  Rather than being hard on ourselves for the past, we can say that for the future we do have a great opportunity here.<\/p> <p>  It is not just about anaerobic digestion; it is also aerobic digestion and composting.  I met recently with the Composting and Aerobic Digestion Association of Ireland, Cr&eacute;, which the committee may have come across.  They made clear to me that their problem was lack of feed stock, but they feel there is a lot they could do.  In short, I think we need to bring this in.  I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to introduce a new reference to anaerobic digestion and other technologies, and the national bioeconomy policy statement.  My officials have been working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this.  They will have something ready for the next Stage.

I would need a definition of what a \"circular compact\" is.  It is quite a phrase.  This amendment needs more work on the wording.  I am in favour of the amendment's approach and I am in favour of the idea of using sectoral compacts to enhance circularity, but I want to bring it to Report Stage.  I want to discuss it with the Office of the Attorney General first, just to make sure that I get the drafting right.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Bruton's anecdote about the purchase of the embassy was great.<\/p><p>Public procurement is my responsibility.  I think the Deputy said that a reply to a parliamentary question showed a low rate of green public procurement.  I presume that dates back to before my time.  We have been working really hard on this.  The programme for Government says that we are to are green all of our public procurement frameworks where possible.  In other words, we are to change the rules about how we purchase each sectoral product type in order to do it in a green way.  We are more than 85% of the way there on that work.  We are to do it within three years.  We are certainly going to make that target.  The next time the data are collected, they will be much more favourable.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has done much work on this.  It has updated the guidelines on green public procurement for the first time in many years.  I have asked the Office of Government Procurement to change its training systems so that it can train the purchasing officers in how to buy in a green way.  The right way to do this is not always obvious.  We have looked at international best practice.  We have worked with the EPA.  We got consultancy advice on it and so on.  It is an ongoing process.  As all frameworks are done now, they will be done in a green way where this is possible and where there is any option for being green.  For example, if we were to buy legal services, could we do that in a green way?  I am not so sure that we could.  However, other areas are much more amenable towards green public procurement.  While I am not accepting that amendment, I will try to bring forward an amendment that will work on Report Stage.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 10, in the name of Deputy Whitmore, is about consultation and poverty-proofing of the strategy.  Certainly, stakeholder groups in poverty, disadvantage and disability will be invited to join the Department&rsquo;s formal circular economy stakeholder group.  I will make sure of that.  Amendment No. 10 would require further extensive discussion with the Office of the Attorney General.  I think it would also require amendments to other sections of the Bill in the form of additional definitions.  However, I agree that we need to have inclusiveness and poverty-proofing of national policies.  This is not just because it is the right and moral thing to do, but also because it makes it more effective, more reasonable, and acceptable to the public.  If the Deputy is amenable, my officials will engage directly with her with a view to developing a form of wording that would be suitable for me to bring forward as an amendment on this issue on Report Stage.<\/p><p> I would like to thank Deputy Whitmore for amendment No. 11.  I will be accepting it.  We have to make sure any changes that we are making in public policy do not disadvantage people because of their abilities.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 12 relates to the biodiversity strategy.

I believe this would be a very useful addition because one of the things that distinguishes the climate action plan that we put in place originally, and which is also reflected in the new plan, is that by having oversight from the office of the Taoiseach we would, as they say in America, \"bite with the President's teeth\".  We would get greater traction in being able to see that Ministers and senior officials take their responsibilities seriously.  I strongly advocate that the Minister of State would consider integrating it because it is the Minister of State's own Department.  The two tracks are parallel.

For example, with a mobile phone that has been glued together, with the battery glued to the case, it is much harder to change the battery than with a the phone that is screwed together.<\/p> <p>  How does one know before one buys a product how repairable or durable it is?

I would expect that in a future where there is a right to repair, when people go into a shop they will see a rating on products showing their repairability and durability in the same way that they see an energy rating on white goods at the moment, which was the result of the previous eco design directive.  People will be able to see whether the product can be repaired and they will have an absolute right to manuals, parts and so on.  <\/p> <p>  While I am very keen that all of that works, this work is happening at an EU level and whatever is done there will then be transposed into Irish law.  I hope I am here to do that when it happens but I am not planning to put a different right to repair into Irish law before we get there.  Repair caf&eacute;s are a part of that and also men's sheds which were referenced by Deputies O'Rourke and Cronin in an earlier amendment.  These are places where people share knowledge on how to fix things and are a critical part of the circular economy.  Our circular economy strategy recognises this and commits to a circular economy for consumer goods, with a focus on the repair sector and helping traditional tradespeople like shoemakers, tailors and so on to succeed in the future.  We are talking about a return to the types of industries that were around in our parents' and grandparents' era.  I am not going to accept these amendments given the work being done at EU level.  A new regulation on eco design is likely to come through shortly and a proposal for a directive to empower consumers for a green transition through better protection against unfair practices and better information, which will address the information imbalance between the seller and the buyer.  With that in mind, I am rejecting these amendments but will be working on them at EU level instead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#N00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>On the basis of what the Minister of State has said, I will be withdrawing amendment No. 25 with a view to having ongoing discussions on these issues before Report Stage.

We had an exchange previously in the D&aacute;il Chamber and the Minister of State referred then to ongoing developments at EU level and I was very conscious of that in drafting our amendment.  However, also being conscious of how slowly things can move at EU level and the fact that there is not, as I understand it, even a draft of the directive yet, I would argue that it is time for us to move more swiftly and to be ahead of the curve.  Given that the Minister of State and officials from Ireland have been engaged at EU level in considering how the European-wide approach is going to be framed in law, I would argue that we could do something here that paves the way for the introduction of the EU directive elsewhere and that makes us leaders on a circular economy and a right to repair approach.  I will be withdrawing this amendment at this point but I do want to bring it back on Report Stage to have a further discussion.  Indeed, we may wish to tweak it, in light of ongoing EU developments.  I join Deputy O'Rourke in asking that there would be engagement with the Opposition on developments here because we all have the same motivation, to ensure that there is a genuine and effective right to repair for consumers, not just for digital electronic equipment, although that is clearly a priority, but also across the circular economy more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#N00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 26:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 12, line 30, after &ldquo;communities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, in particular, communities which are disadvantaged and marginalised&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#N00600","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&ldquo;(o) to facilitate and support initiatives undertaken by communities or organisations which promote the principles of a just transition and climate justice;&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#N00800","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 28:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 4, after &ldquo;environment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including for the purposes of protecting biodiversity&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#N01000","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 29:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, line 36, after &ldquo;accordingly.&rdquo;, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;The Minister will ensure the following in relation to the membership of the committee: <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t(a) all members of the committee must go through the public appointments service;<br \/><br \/>(b) candidates may only be considered once they have completed their application through the public appointments service;<br \/><br \/>(c) that gender balance is reflected in its membership; and<br \/><br \/>(d) at least one appointee has expertise, or professional experience, on the subject of poverty, just transition and climate justice.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>I will press this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#N01200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Section 9 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>SECTION 10<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 are related and my be discussed together,by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#N01700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 30:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 14, line 24, to delete &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;  <\/blockquote> <p>This amendment seeks to assign responsibility for the circular economy programme to the Minister as opposed to the EPA.

While bearing in mind that this is a Bill about the principles of wastage and circularity rather than toxicity, there are genuine concerns, if not real problems, with these chemicals.  They can be extremely hazardous and because of this, they are being regulated at EU level rather than by individual member states.  In recent years the EU has put in place a number of new strategies aimed at strengthening legislation to ensure that chemicals are safe and sustainable by design and that the most hazardous chemicals are banned.  My Department and other Departments and agencies that have responsibility for chemicals policy are engaging actively with the EU on these matters and strongly supporting the initiatives being undertaken at EU level.  Of particular relevance with regard to PFAS are the EU farm to fork strategy, the EU chemical strategy for sustainability and the European Commission-led review of the packaging and packaging waste directive.  I am committed to ensuring Ireland plays a lead role in pushing the level of ambition in proposals emerging from this review.  Effective regulation of PFAS is being addressed at EU level and we are actively engaging with our EU colleagues on that.

For example, one may be using a crockery mug to get a coffee instead of a paper cup and while the crockery mug may not be recyclable, it is certainly much more environmentally friendly.  One could use a crockery mug 500 times but only use a paper cup once and even though one cannot recycle crockery, I would not be in favour of banning it or restricting its use.  There are cases where a reusable alternative is not recyclable but is extremely durable, as is the case with a typical mug that one finds in one's kitchen.  I do not foresee such circumstances arising often but I can use the legislation as drafted to ban items if I need to, under section 14.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 provides that the Minister shall, within 12 months of the passing of this Act, \"draft and publish a report examining how single use plastics used in the sale of fruit and vegetables can be reduced.\"  The example in France has inspired this amendment.  The French have gone ahead and introduced restrictions for particular types of hard fruit and vegetables.  They are planning, over time, to widen that out to softer fruits.  I would like to accept the amendment and such a report could certainly help in establishing circular economy principles in the retail sector but I want to review the 12-month timeframe.  I want to make sure that it is realistic and that any report can be completed on time.  I would ask the Deputies to withdraw their amendment and I will introduce it on Report Stage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#P00400","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 38, subject to a note being circulated.

We have a 50% target by 2030 and the amendment seeks to break that down into annual and sectoral targets.  That would be a detailed breakdown.  By way of comparison, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act sets five-year targets as well as sectoral targets but they are not on an annual basis.  It is probably unrealistic to expect a straight-line year-by-year target, particularly if there is such a target for each sector.  Sectoral division is needed and one needs to have some idea in that regard but what the amendment proposes is too granular.  In practice, when one is trying to meet a target over a number of years, there are good years and bad years.  The work of strategy and preparations may suddenly kick in during a particular year, for example.  To do it on a year-by-year basis would be very difficult.<\/p> <p>  There is a process under way at EU level to set targets to reduce food waste across the EU which will take into account data reported by member states in mid-2022.  Subject to EU developments, it is expected that the baseline year that links to the 2030 50% reduction target will be the reference year 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s food waste dataset for 2020 will be reported by the Environmental Protection Agency in mid-2022.  An adoption of the legislative proposal on EU food waste reduction targets is foreseen for the second quarter of 2023.  At the moment, we do not even have a base year for what the EU is proposing, so we are kind of in the dark as regards what the 50% actually means or, in other words, what the volumetric quantity of food waste will be in 2030.  It is difficult to set targets without knowing what the EU will come back with for the base year.  We need to know the base year before we can do something like that.<\/p> <p>  The draft national food waste prevention roadmap was recently made available for public consultation.  It commits to setting interim targets following the establishment of the baseline.  These will take account of developments at EU level.  That is the right thing to do.  We need interim targets.  I do not think they will be annual targets but there will certainly be interim targets based on the baseline set by the EU.  It is appropriate that we await the outcome of the EU process for setting food waste reduction targets before determining the approach for setting food waste reduction targets in the national food waste prevention strategy.  For that reason, I will not be accepting amendment No. 44.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 45, tabled by Deputy Whitmore, seeks that additional documents be included in the Bill.  That is worthwhile and the right thing to do, so I will be accepting the amendment.  I thank the Deputy for suggesting it.  Following consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I may bring further amendments on Report Stage to provide for definitions of each of these documents in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 46, 48, 49 and 50 relate to reviews.  It is intended that the national food waste prevention strategy, which is a statutory policy, will establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to monitor progress of key actions on food waste prevention to ensure Ireland delivers on its food waste prevention commitments.  A draft national food waste prevention strategy was recently made available for public consultation.  It outlines that a food waste prevention task force comprising representatives from key sectors and organisations will be established and will monitor the implementation and progress of the roadmap delivery.  The findings of the food waste prevention task force will be reviewed and, in line with the Bill, the roadmap will be updated accordingly to ensure actions remain relevant and appropriate and so that Ireland is on the right path to deliver on its food waste reduction obligation of a 50% cut by 2030.<\/p><p> I note the intention of the amendments and agree it would be appropriate for the Minister to conduct an annual review of the national food waste prevention strategy.  Accordingly, I will accept amendments Nos. 48 and 49, tabled by Deputies Bruton and Br&iacute;d Smith, respectively, because they will give effect to the intention of all the amendments on this issue.  Given Deputy Smith and, in respect of amendment No. 45, Deputy Whitmore are not present, I will reintroduce their amendments on Report Stage.  Because amendments Nos. 48 and 49 will achieve what I have set out, I will not accept amendments Nos. 46 and 50.  Nevertheless, I would like to thank those Deputies for introducing the amendments, given the provision is a worthwhile contribution that will improve the Bill.<\/p><p> Finally, amendment No. 47, tabled by Deputies O'Rourke and Cronin, would provide that the Minister \"shall ensure the national food waste prevention strategy is accompanied by powers, authority and accountability\".  It is intended the national food waste prevention strategy will establish a monitoring and evaluation framework on a statutory basis to check progress on key actions in respect of food waste prevention to ensure Ireland will deliver on its food waste prevention commitments.  As such, I do not propose to accept that amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#Q02300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I take on board the Minister of State's reply and will withdraw the amendment with a view to reintroducing it on Report Stage.

As I explained in response to Deputy Farrell, it is a limited power to erect CCTV.  To create a scheme, a local authority cannot just install a CCTV system but will have to go through a prescribed number of steps outlined in the Bill.  For example, it will have to prepare a site management plan for each scheme and set out the arrangements for monitoring and recording, how it will disclose the images that are produced and how it will preserve the recordings.  All of that is intended to comply with data protection rules and the Data Protection Commissioner has been extensively consulted in the drawing-up of the legislation.  Moreover, a data protection impact assessment must be carried out in accordance with section 84 of the Data Protection Act 2018, which is an onerous task, and there is an overhead associated with that.  In addition, for each proposed scheme the relevant local authority has to be satisfied the scheme is proportionate to the enforcement and deterrence needs identified at the proposed site and that it meets the data protection requirements.<\/p><p>There is a mandatory code of practice, which will be drafted in consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and will ensure relevant data protection legislation is complied with during the authorisation and operational use of these technologies.  The code of practice will be subject to approval by the Minister.  A combination of legislation, non-statutory guidance and the use of mandatory codes of practice are the measures that are being put in place to ensure the processing of personal data may be carried out by local authorities trying to enforce litter and waste law, while meeting GDPR requirements and addressing the concerns raised by the Data Protection Commission.  There has been a long and detailed consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to the drafting of these provisions and all concerns raised by the Data Protection Commission have now been addressed.  It is not easy to put these schemes into practice.  There are a lot of safeguards around them and so one year would be too short a period of time.  That is why we are allowing for a five-year period.  I will therefore not be accepting the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#R03500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Section 16, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Sections 17 and 18 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>SECTION 19<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 53 to 55, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#S00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, to delete line 22 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(iv) an offence under section 34(10A), or<br \/><br \/>(v) an offence under section 39(9), in so far as the offence consists of a contravention of a provision of regulations made under section 39(4) prohibiting, other than in accordance with those regulations, the recovery or disposal in a specified manner of a specified class or classes of waste, including a class or classes of household waste,<br \/><br \/>or&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>Fixed payment notices are an administrative alternative to court proceedings and can assist with waste enforcement efforts.  They provide an alternative enforcement tool to the courts and a more flexible means of addressing low-level non-compliance, facilitating greater levels of enforcement and increased compliance at local level.  We are used to fixed payment notices from traffic laws and so on.  The Bill already provides for new fixed payment notices in respect of offences under the waste tyres extended producer responsibility regulations and in respect of breaches of a waste collection permit.  These amendments to section 10B of the Waste Management Act 1996 provide for two additional fixed payment notices in relation to existing offences under the Waste Management Act 1996.<\/p><p>First, I have provided for a fixed payment notice for a breach of section 34(10A).  Under this section, it is an offence to furnish false or misleading information to a local authority under section 34, which relates to waste collection permits.  I am also providing that a local authority may issue a fixed payment notice for non-compliance with a condition in a waste facility permit.  The Waste Management Act 1996 provides that a person shall not dispose of, or undertake the recovery of, waste at a facility unless they have a waste licence.  Waste licences are issued by the EPA.  However, a waste licence is not required if the person carrying out the disposal or recovery of the waste complies with specified conditions in relation to the carrying out of such recovery or disposal.  These conditions are set out in waste facility permits.  Where a person does not comply with the conditions of a waste facility permit, they are guilty of an offence.  The proposed amendment creates a fixed payment notice in respect of a contravention of a condition in a waste facility permit.  This may be confusing.  A waste facility permit could, for example, be issued to someone who is temporarily storing WEEE waste but not disposing of it before it goes on to another facility for disposal.  That is why it is managed through permits rather than licences.<\/p><p>These fixed payment notices are all linked to existing offences under current legislation.  I am not creating any new offences.  This will facilitate local authorities to impose and provide more proportionate responses to littering and illegal dumping.  It also means that the first recourse is not the courts, which could be a more costly proposition for everyone concerned.  That is where I am coming from with regard to these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#S00700","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 54:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, line 34, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; where it secondly occurs. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#S00900","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 55:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, to delete line 35 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(II) a contravention of section 34(1)(a),<br \/><br \/>(III) an offence under section 34(10A), or<br \/><br \/>(IV) an offence under section 39(9), in so far as the offence consists of a contravention of a provision of regulations made under section 39(4) prohibiting, other than in accordance with those regulations, the recovery or disposal in a specified manner of a specified class or classes of waste, including a class or classes of household waste.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#S01100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Section 19, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>SECTION 20<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 56 and 57 have already been discussed with amendment No. 52.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#S01500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 56:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 27, line 27, to delete &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1 year&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>I will withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Minister of State's comments.

I mentioned on Second Stage that I would be bringing forward an amendment on Committee Stage to give effect to this recommendation.  Amendment No. 58 gives effect to this recommendation of the committee.  It also redrafts the existing subparagraph (ix) by dividing it into further subparagraphs for the purpose of clarity.  This amendment gives effect to the recommendation of the committee and also achieves the purpose of amendment No. 59.  Therefore, I will not accept amendment No. 59.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#U00500","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I will withdraw amendment No. 59 on the basis of amendment No. 58 and consider whether I need to bring forward a further amendment on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#U00600","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 58 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 59 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Section 24, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Sections 25 and 26 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 are related and will be taken together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#U01200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 60:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 36, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&quot;Amendment of section 34C of Act of 1996 <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>27.<\/b>Section 34C of the Act of 1996 is amended&mdash;

has the meaning given to it by section 65A(1) of the Act of 2011.&quot;.&quot;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>As the committee will be aware, the general scheme of the Bill as approved by the Government provides for the establishment of a GDPR-compliant register of households without a waste collection service.  During the debate on Second Stage, I mentioned that it was not possible to complete the necessary consultation process required to introduce these provisions at the time of publication of the Bill and that I intended to introduce them by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 60 provides for the creation by local authorities of a database of postcodes in respect of addresses that do not avail of a waste collection service.<\/p><p>Currently section 34C(7) of the Waste Management Act 1996 provides for the creation of registers by local authorities of premises that either avail of a waste collection service or deposit waste at a facility.  This register, which is compiled from data submitted to local authorities by waste operators, facilitates the monitoring of services provided and that the waste holder and the service provider are complying with regard to obligations.  Amendment No. 60 provides that local authorities may use the information provided to them for the purpose of the existing register under section 34C together with information provided via the Eircode database to establish a register of Eircodes in respect of addresses that do not avail of a waste collection service, do not deposit their waste at a facility or do not have their waste otherwise disposed of or treated in accordance with the Waste Management Act.  This register will be a register of Eircodes only.  No personalised data will held in the database.  The purpose of the database is to allow local authorities to direct efforts in filling in service gaps in a more focused manner.  It is expected that the majority of householders have measures in place to dispose of their waste.  Many will have a waste collection service while others may deposit their waste at facilities or share a collection service with a neighbour or relative.  This amendment will allow local authorities to focus enforcement efforts on the very few householders who do not legally dispose of their waste.<\/p><p>It was clear from the debate on Second Stage that all Deputies are concerned with tackling illegal dumping.  This provision gives key support to local authorities in their enforcement activities.  The database will contain Eircodes only - not the names and addresses of individual householders.  Local authorities will still need to contact or visit the address related to that Eircode to establish how the householder deals with their waste.  The householder will then be in a position to advise the local authority as to how they dispose of or treat their waste in accordance with the Act.<\/p><p>The advantage of this provision is that it allows for focused and targeted enforcement by local authorities and makes more efficient and effective use of local authority resources.  During the drafting of this amendment, my officials had formal and detailed discussions with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  It is a key concern of mine that this data is not misused and that privacy rights of citizens are protected.  Following discussions with the Data Protection Commission, a number of changes were made to the original draft in the general scheme to address concerns of the commission regarding the establishment of the database.  These changes included the limitation of the Eircode database to the local authority functional area, the requirement for the approval of the chief executive of the local authority for the establishment of the database, a statutory requirement that the register is proportionate and necessary for the purposes for which it is established, provision for reviews of the operation of the database and an obligation on the Minister to issue guidelines to local authorities on the use of the database.  A data protection impact assessment must also be carried out when a database is established and the register must be maintained in compliance with Part 5 of the Data Protection Act 2018.<\/p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner has considered the final text of this amendment and may have no further observations.  My officials have also engaged closely with the local government sector, which is also very supportive of the amendment.  Finally, I have provided that the amendment to section 34C will apply to commercial and household waste rather than just household waste.  This was recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny report and I was happy to accept the committee's recommendation in this regard.  I am satisfied that this amendment provides necessary and proportionate support for local authorities in their enforcement activities and I believe it also provides robust legal protections for the privacy rights of citizens.  I ask the committee to support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#U01300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Sections 27 to 29, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is not present, amendment No. 61 cannot be moved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#U01800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 61 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>SECTION 30<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 62:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 41, line 15, after &quot;monitored&quot; to insert &quot;, or are capable of being monitored,&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022050300002#U02100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Section 30, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Section 31 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>SECTION 32<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 63:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 47, line 9, after &quot;Minister&quot; to insert &quot;or the Government&quot;. <\/blockquote> <p>This is a drafting amendment that will correct the omission of the words &quot;or the Government&quot; from section 32(12) of the Bill.

The term &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; implies that an individual was a resident of an institution for a prolonged period of time.  The length of time that a person was in an institution should not determine whether this Bill applies to them or not.  For example, if a young woman was only in a home for one night and she died of potentially unnatural causes, she should be included in this legislation.<\/p><p>Second, this ambiguity arises because the term &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other submissions, identified this non-definition as being an issue.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not resolve that matter.  The definitions of the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; vary within Irish legislation.  It is unclear what &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; means.  I am suggesting the removal of the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; to clarify this restrictive ambiguity.  In the Minister&rsquo;s reply, I ask him to clarify if the understanding of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; means an individual who spent any time, even one night, at the time of their death?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#A01300","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Yes, it does.

There are two criteria: the person must have died while a resident; and must be buried before the State may act.  The requirement to meet both criteria is potentially a barrier and one should be sufficient.  That a young woman, baby or child died in a home should be enough to trigger an intervention or that a young woman, baby or child is inappropriately buried should be enough to trigger an intervention.

As the Minister mentioned on the previous amendment, the Bill is designed to interfere only in instances of manifestly inappropriate burials.  This means that even though a young woman or child may have died in unnatural, unknown or suspicious circumstances, that is not, in itself, reason for intervention.  This Bill, as my previous amendments outline, always requires inappropriate burials, and there is extensive definition of what constitutes such.  Suspicious or unnatural deaths or deaths in unknown instances, are not enough to warrant an intervention.  This is simply wrong.  Several recommendations in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report support this including:<\/p><blockquote>\t5. The scope of the General Scheme be revised to include any burial site where the circumstances surrounding the death and\/or body-disposal method warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness.<br \/><br \/>6.  That intervention should give due consideration to suspicious or unlawful deaths as well as the existence of inappropriate burials. <\/blockquote><p>The Bill currently ignores these recommendations and the extensive evidence on which they are based.  Several witnesses highlighted international human rights and traditional justices standards should be adopted.  I found the general scheme to be lacking in this regard.  Unfortunately, the Bill as drafted also fails to meet these standards.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties recommended the use of the UN special rapporteur&rsquo;s definition of mass grave sites including any burial site &quot;where the circumstances surrounding the death and\/or body disposal method warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness&quot;.  Similarly, the Adoption Rights Alliance noted the current imbalance in the Bill with intervention based on the existence of inappropriate burials rather than suspicious or unlawful deaths.<br\/><br\/>Witnesses such as the representatives from the Tuam Home Survivor Network and Guernica 37 pointed out that we know about practices of neglect, malnutrition and malpractice in institutions.  All deaths associated with these homes are already suspicious and need to be investigated.  My amendments have attempted to address the concerns of witnesses by including unnatural death or death by unknown causes as stand-alone reasons to intervene at a site.  I have drawn on language from the Coroners Act in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Is the Minister supportive of the broader principle rather than specific wording?  If that is the case, I will consider withdrawing the amendment if he can commit to changing the criteria for intervention to include suspicious or unnatural death as a stand-alone rationale.

This is the legislative gap that the Bill seeks to fill in order that these interventions can take place at Tuam and at any other site or similar circumstances come to light.  For that reason, I am not in a position to accept this group of amendments.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 6 and 16, as well as No. 78, seek to alter the definition of principal burial land and the condition for making the Government order so that an intervention can take place which does not relate to burials which are manifestly inappropriate but rather, relates to burials of persons whose deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or suddenly and of unknown causes.  Amendment No. 38 seeks to alter the function of the director in order that he or she would have to arrange for forensic excavation and recovery of human remains where death would have come about in a violent or unnatural manner or suddenly, or from unknown causes.  This approach would fundamentally alter the scope of the Bill and would ultimately change the under lying rationale of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of difficulties with what are proposed.  First, these amendments would represent a strong interference with the jurisdiction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  Any intervention or investigation in respect of violent or unnatural death should clearly come under the remit of those two bodies.  This is why the Bill rightly provides up front that an order may not be made if an investigation or inquest is already under way and the Garda Commissioner is of the view that it will be premature to make an order for intervention pending the outcome of the investigation.  Similarly, the Bill also rightly provides that where an intervention under this legislation is under way, the director of the agency must notify both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner of any evidence of violent or unnatural death that comes to light during the intervention and then follow their directions in terms of what to do next.  Moreover, it is unclear how within this specific legislation it would be established prior to intervention that a death occurred in a violent, unnatural, sudden and unknown manner.  I have stated before that this legislation seeks to complement existing law including the Coroners Act.  It is not seeking to replace it.  It does not seek to set up a new system.  When we moved from the general scheme to this full draft we made a major change and that we moved all restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner and that was significant.  Furthermore, under this legislation, the director will have to try and identify the circumstances and causes of death of recovered remains and if evidence of violent or natural death emerges the director must then notify the coroner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na immediately.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 52 is concerned with changing the description of the type of death that must be notified to the coroner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The current wording of &ldquo;violent or unnatural&rdquo; would encompass any suspicious deaths where there is potential evidence of same including homicide.  In practical terms, it is important that the language that we use in the legislation is aligned with a basis of exhumation in the Coroners Act.  More broadly, the director under this legislation would publish a full post-recovery analysis report in respect of all recovered remains and will ensure that it is brought to the attention of the relevant coroner.  For that reason, I cannot particularly support that amendment.  I believe that the vast majority of what is encompassed in amendment No. 52 is already covered in the text of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#D00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>The Minister is saying that it will alter the scope of the Bill.

This is an age-old problem.  The Garda and the coroner have not intervened.

The issue that is being addressed here brings us back to that question of at what point the Government and the State make the very significant intervention that we propose to make with Tuam, which is the excavation of human remains.  We have to recognise in our culture the importance of leaving the dead undisturbed, and balancing that with circumstances where the burial is manifestly inappropriate, like in Tuam, there is the question of whether an intervention should take place.  As we have said before with regard to other sites, there are differing views as to whether this sort of intervention, or an intervention of this scale, is the correct action for the State to take, which is why that term &ldquo;manifestly inappropriate&rdquo;, defined around having regard to a number of points, is set out.<\/p><p>This Bill is designed to allow for that lawful right for the State to intervene where a manifestly inappropriate burial has taken place.  Under existing law, the State does not have the power to intervene with the level of depth and comprehensiveness that is set out in this Bill.  There is not just the question of excavating and recovering the remains, but the question of that detailed analysis afterwards, leading to a DNA process and leading to reburial at the end.  As such, in light of the scale of this intervention, we do use this term &ldquo;manifestly inappropriate&rdquo; and that is defined having regard to criteria set out in section 8(1), as follows: <\/p> <blockquote> \t[T]he human remains-<br \/><br \/>(a) are uncoffined,<br \/><br \/>(b) are buried in such a manner that they would not have complied with the requirements, at the time of such burial, specified in the Burial Grounds Regulations,<br \/><br \/>(c) are buried in a way that would not reasonably be considered to provide a dignified interment, or<br \/><br \/>(d) are buried collectively and in a manner or in a location that is repugnant to common decency and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place. <\/blockquote> <p>These criteria are included in this legislation to ensure sufficient consideration is given to key factors before any intervention can take place at a burial site.

This is a key barrier to justice for the deceased.  A separate office for each site will obviously create obstacles.  It means that survivors, families and campaigners will be forced to advocate for interventions at each and every known or suspected site.  It vastly reduces the chances of a site ever being investigated and once again places the responsibility on survivors to seek justice.<\/p><p>Practically, it is also a wasteful and nonsensical approach.  A well-resourced office could build up knowledge and expertise in dealing with these highly sensitive matters.  It could foster relationships with all stakeholders, especially with survivors, survivor groups, advocates and family members.  It would be more effective and reassuring for those affected.<\/p><p>This Bill is designed for the necessary intervention at Tuam and nobody is arguing against that for one second.  However, we must also be honest.  The only reason the site will be excavated is due to public and international pressure.  The then Government and Department resisted calls until the public outcry became too loud.  Similarly, that is the only reason we had the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  This Bill is structured to ensure it is highly unlikely that any other site will be examined.  It is designed to intervene at Tuam because it has to but what about the other mother and baby homes?  What about industrial schools, psychiatric hospitals and other institutions that also have a deeply troubled past?  Under the Bill, it is extremely unlikely that any other site will ever be examined despite all we know about the systematic abuse and neglect in those institutions.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to outline the rationale for not providing a standing office which is empowered to intervene in qualifying sites.  Why must a separate office be set up for each site?  Does the Minister consider it likely that he will seek intervention at any other site apart from Tuam?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#H00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>As Deputy Cairns said, these amendments aim to transform what the legislation is seeking to do by setting up an agency for a finite duration to examine a site where manifestly inappropriate burials took place.  It is for that reason I cannot accept this set of amendments.  The Deputy is right that no one is questioning the need to intervene in Tuam.  We know that manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place there and when that was discovered, the Government of the day was advised that bespoke legislation was required to respond to that discovery.  While the intervention that will be initiated later this year will take a long period of time, likely years, it is a discrete piece of work and will come to an end once all excavation, recovery, post-recovery analysis and identification have taken place and the remains have either been reinterred or returned to relatives.  If no similar manifestly inappropriate burial site has been ascertained at that point, it is difficult to see what the purpose of having a standing agency would be.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 11 would remove the words \"from time to time\" from section 7.  That enables the Government to establish an office of a director of authorised intervention for a specific period and it also enables the Government to establish a new office on each occasion that an intervention is required.  The aim of this section is to establish an office of a finite duration, as I say, to intervene at a given burial site associated with an institution where there are manifestly inappropriate burials.  One of the reasons we have taken an approach that includes a site-specific agency and a site-specific director is that it ensures the work of that agency is fully geared towards and focused on the excavation at that particular site.  It ensures that the advisory board that is set up will include family members or survivors of that specific institution so that survivors and former residents of the institution can influence the actions and work of the agency.  I think that represents the best way of responding to the unique situation in Tuam and any such situation that may exist at a future site.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, amendment No. 23 seeks to remove the phrase \"from time to time\" from section 7(6).  That section enables the Government to amend the functions it has assigned to the director in an area of land.  The words \"from time to time\" are included because of the potential for multiple organisations carrying out multiple interventions over time and the finite duration of each intervention.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 33, 35 and 37 are closely related.  Amendment No. 33 would prevent the office being established for the initial period required to undertake the intervention at the Tuam site and would prevent the extension of such a period.  It would also stop the office being identified with the Tuam burial site.  Amendment No. 35 would result in the appointment of a director without any period of appointment being specified.

The Minister's response further reinforces my opinion that this legislation is only geared towards investigating Tuam and no other known sites.  Why would separate bodies be set up every time?  That will cost the State more.  It will result in survivors having to engage and potentially relive trauma more than once because they will be required to engage with the different bodies every time they are set up.

Officials in the Department were central to the requirement for individuals to have spent at least six months as a child in a mother and baby home and for the highly insulting &euro;5,000 redress for survivors.  The Department has already made clear that money is its main concern, not justice.  It also delayed the progress of the scheme.

As we know, the excavation and recovery of human remains is a very significant act.  It is complex and that is why we have this very complex piece of legislation.  The desire and need for that must be balanced with the manifest inappropriateness of the particular areas.  The legislation therefore sets out a number of factors the Government should take into account in determining if an intervention is proportionate.  That includes the need to accord dignity to the persons who are buried at the particular site; the need to respect the views of the relatives of the persons buried on the piece of land; public health issues; and alternative options, if any is available.<\/p> <p>  Safeguarding the public interest is an important concept that needs to be present within legislation.  In the context of this legislation, which is significantly impacting on constitutional rights, it is important that the legislation itself sets out a very clear legal basis grounded in the public interest for the impact that it has on constitutional rights.  Looking at the factors that are listed here, that will be deleted, it is safe to assume that no one would question the importance of according dignity to the persons buried on the particular site, but public health is an important aspect of intervention and that is one of the reasons why issues around the exhumation of remains are so tightly circumscribed in law already.  We cannot disregard the impact on the wider public.<\/p> <p>  I know we all agree with the need to respect the views of relatives of persons buried on the land.

These are nuanced issues that should be overseen by experts who can respectfully understand and respond to each case as it arises.

I would argue there is a strong rationale for excluding official burial grounds and retaining the time period applicable in the legislation.  It is important to ensure appropriately buried human remains are not disturbed unnecessarily.  In addition, we need to take into account health and safety considerations.  Section 44 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 specifies where burials can appropriately take place.  Where this legislation applies, there is an existing provision for an exhumation licence to be issued by the relevant Minister for a body or bodies in that location.  An intervention under this Bill would, therefore, not be warranted if the provisions of the 1948 Act are applicable to the burial ground in question.<\/p> <p>  In response to the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which raised concern about the 70-year restriction that was contained in the original heads of Bill, the legislation now encompasses burials dating from the foundation of the State.  We identified the date of 1922 to align with the investigation period within which the commission was investigation was operating.  Removing any time restriction would create significant challenges that would expand the scope of the legislation significantly and could result in investigations of institutions that were operating in the 19th century or even earlier.  It would be extremely difficult to assess burials that took place such a long time ago.  It would also be very difficult and probably very unlikely that we would be able to bring together family members around whom to base an identification campaign, as provided for in the legislation.  It is reasonable not to disturb remains that were buried appropriately unless there is a very clear rationale for doing so.  The 1948 Act makes provision for specific circumstances in which there can be an intervention in inappropriate burials.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is that there may be situations - again, this is a potential scenario - where an excavation is unsafe for individuals to undertake.  The health and safety of those undertaking the investigation must be considered.  This probably would only arise in extreme situations.  Even in terms of the excavation that will take place in Tuam, there is a range of actions that will have to be taken, for example, to ensure the very large wall that is right beside the chamber remains safe.  Those actions will be taken to ensure the investigation can take place.  However, there may be circumstances in which an excavation could not take place without endangering the health and safety of individuals.  This would be in extreme circumstances but the legislation must at least make provision for such a situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#L00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are related and will be discussed together.

We have an idea of what is happening in Tuam because there has already been an intervention but at other sites, we might not have that degree of certainty.<\/p> <p>  By removing these provisions, the director may be legally required to perform a function that, in reality, cannot be implemented.  For example, if the initial order gave the director the power and the duty to undertake a DNA sampling process but, let us say, no relative came forward to provide DNA, in that situation the director has a legal duty to undertake a role that he or she cannot undertake.  In that situation, it would be legitimate to give the Government the right to say the director should continue with the excavation and recovery, but that the director does not have to undertake that part of it and does not have that duty any more because he or she is not in a position to do so.  It is just to give a degree of flexibility in terms of the unknowns a director and an agency will face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#M01200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 26:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, to delete lines 35 and 36. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#M01400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, to delete lines 39 and 40. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#M01600","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Section 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#M02000","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 28:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, line 7, to delete &ldquo;, at the time of such burial,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>On amendment No. 28, there is no principled reason to specify that the contemporary burial practices from the 1940s and 1950s, and-or earlier or later, should apply to any potential burial lands.

In regard to amendment No. 28, that would remove the phrase &ldquo;at the time of such burial&rdquo; from subsection 8(1)(b) and would, therefore, undermine one of the criteria used to assess whether there was a manifestly inappropriate burial at a burial site.  It is important that the assessment of burials relates to the time that such burials took place and the agreed custom, practice and requirements of that time.  It is difficult to justify assessing burials with reference to requirements which were not applicable or perhaps did not exist at the time of such burials.  Of course, the burial ground regulations have also changed since 1922, which is the start of the period from which the legislation is applicable.<\/p> <p>  I will also not be able to accept amendment No. 29, which would, on page 16, delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 12 down to and including &ldquo;place&rdquo; on line 13 from subsection 8(1)(d).  One of the criteria that the Government must try to assess before we decide if a burial site associated with an institution has \"manifestly inappropriate burials\" is whether most people at the time of the burial would have found the burial site at a site like Tuam acceptable.  Without the phrase, \"would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place\", it is a lot more difficult to interpret what &ldquo;repugnant to common decency&rdquo; means and there is a risk of incorrectly applying present-day customs or values.<\/p> <p>  We cannot undermine the rigour of the legislation by reducing clarity on these important and sensitive criteria.

It was introduced in particular to ensure expertise not directly commissioned or hired by the agency and independent of it would be able to exert influence on decisions on the undertaking of the DNA identification programme, for example.  It would also ensure the views of relatives would have a direct means of influencing the determinations of the agency.  It is something my Department and I brought forward.<\/p> <p>  We would have this chaired by someone with coronial expertise, again recognising the importance of having the work being done here in a way that is fully compliant with coronial practice.

It would narrow incredibly the scope of people who could potentially be a chair.  I do not even know if we could be guaranteed to have somebody with both elements of expertise.  That is my concern and why I do not feel I can accept the provision.<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of having a representative of the local authority.  It is important that there be a mechanism whereby the work done by an agency can operate in a wider context of the performance of services in that area.  For example, a local authority would clearly relinquish any role related to burials under the 1948 legislation.  It is important that a wider sense of the locality be reflected in the actions of the agency.  That is reflected to the director and the agency through the advisory board and although it is only one position within the advisory board, it is important that it is reflected.

Deputy Ward is absolutely right as regards the complexity of the work that will have to take place for the recovery of these remains.

The Government has made a commitment to a multidisciplinary approach.  I reassure the Deputies that in my mind that is the only way we can achieve what is required, particularly in the Tuam site.<\/p> <p>  The Coroners Act does not regulate investigation.  For this reason, it is unclear to me why investigation and post-recovery analysis under this legislation needs to be implemented in accordance with the Coroners Act.  Of course, it is critical that if evidence of violence and unnatural death emerges, the coroner is notified and that is permitted under this legislation but I also highlight the definition at the start of the Bill, which specifies that forensic investigation and recovery means excavation and recovery \"in a manner sufficient to satisfy legal requirements regarding the use and storage of evidence in connection with the identification of human remains, including in criminal proceedings\".  Therefore, the legislation commits to applying forensic standards so that any evidence gathered through the process can be used in proceedings, including criminal ones.  This places a clear obligation on the director when arranging for excavation and recovery of remains under section 35.<\/p> <p>  These proposals do not strengthen the Bill but weaken it and slightly confuse the range of roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#P02200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 34, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:  \t&quot;(b) in accordance with the Coroners Act 1962,&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#P02400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>Section 35 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>SECTION 36<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 52:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 35, line 8, after &quot;violent&quot; to insert &quot;accidental, homicide, undetermined or suspicious deaths&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#P02800","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Section 36 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Sections 37 and 38 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>SECTION 39<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 37, line 2, to delete &quot;A Director may resume relevant works on the land concerned&quot; and substitute &quot;A Director may resume relevant works on principal burial land or ancillary burial land, or both, as the case may be, after a suspension of such works under <i>section 36 <\/i>or <i>37<\/i>&quot;. <\/blockquote> <p>This is a technical amendment that aims to ensure the section is interpreted as intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#P03300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Section 39, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Sections 40 to 42, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>SECTION 43<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 54 cannot be moved as the proposers of the amendment are not here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#P03800","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 54 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Section 43 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Sections 44 and 45 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>SECTION 46<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 55:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 42, line 35, to delete &quot;A Director may,&quot; and substitute &quot;Where human remains of more than one person have been recovered, a Director may,&quot;. <\/blockquote> <p>This is another minor technical amendment.

Essentially, it is proposed to replace the phrase following &quot;persons&quot; with &quot;member of staff or person&quot;.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 65 has been tabled to ensure alignment between section 48(3) and section 68(1), in terms of describing the withdrawal from the programme.  Amendment No. 66 is necessary to ensure consistency in the use of the word &ldquo;notice&rdquo; in that sentence.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 67 provides that the relevant Minister must consult the Data Protection Commission prior to making regulations to facilitate in the identification programme.  This is on the foot of advice from the DPC that further consultation should be undertaken with that organisation prior to the enactment of regulations under the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 68 is proposed to ensure alignment between section 74(2)(d) and section 48(2)(a)(iv).  The latter specifies that applicants will confirm participation in an identification programme in a form specified in regulations.  Section 74(d) needs to be updated to remain consistent with that formulation of wording.  Alongside this update, it is important to ensure that section 74(2)(d)(ii) still retains the reference to consent regarding the taking of samples.  This is why amendment No. 69 has been tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#Q03000","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Section 60, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":636,"content":"<p>SECTION 61<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Amendment 64 has already been discussed with amendment No. 63.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#Q03400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 64:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 53, to delete lines 13 to 16 and substitute &ldquo;(Historic Remains) Database from a member of staff of FSI or from a person who took a sample referred to in <i>section 52 <\/i>where the member of staff or person concerned consents in writing to having that sample taken.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022050300002#Q03500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Section 61, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Sections 62 to 65, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":642,"content":"<p>SECTION 66<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651532400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 66 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I wish to signal my intention to table an amendment to section 66 on Report Stage.

The DNA database oversight committee was established under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014.

We are also joined remotely by Ms Mair&eacute;ad Phelan of the National Building Control Office.  They are all very welcome.  The opening statements have been circulated to members and will be available on the website after the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamatory action at the meeting.  There are some limitations on parliamentary privilege for witnesses who are attending remotely from outside Leinster House and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I will invite witnesses to make their opening statements and perhaps they might limit those statements to approximately five minutes, as there are quite a few witnesses here today, which is good.  We will hear from Enterprise Ireland, the Office of Public Works, the Irish Green Energy Council and the building control office, in that order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to present to the committee on the topic of carbon and energy within the construction industry and outline the actions and initiatives that Enterprise Ireland is engaged with to support companies in this area.<\/p><p>I am the divisional manager for food and sustainability with Enterprise Ireland.  I would like to introduce my colleagues who are accompanying me, Ms Rowena Dwyer, the department manager for sustainability and climate change, and online, Mr. Neil Kerrigan, Mr. Ross O&rsquo;Colmain and Mr. Kevin Flynn.  <\/p><p> With the support of the Department Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s purpose is helping Irish companies to start, grow, innovate and win export sales.  We work with internationally-focused Irish enterprises across all sectors of the economy, including the construction and cement sector, supporting them to strengthen their competitiveness and productivity, increase innovation and realise their growth potential, thereby contributing to employment and economic growth across all regions. <\/p><p> The transition to a low carbon and circular economy and achievement of a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 across all sectors of the economy represents a whole-of-society challenge.  Enterprise, along with all other sectors, must fundamentally change to adapt to this challenge and realise the many opportunities this transformation represents. <\/p><p> Our recently published strategy, Leading in a Changing World, sets out a vision for 2030 of Irish enterprises creating solutions for global challenges and delivering sustainable prosperity throughout Ireland.  Transforming the sustainability performance of Irish enterprise and supporting companies to capitalise on the growth opportunities presented by the low carbon transition are key areas of focus of our strategy and of our work with companies over the coming decade and beyond. <\/p><p> The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2021 sets out a target for the enterprise sector of reducing emissions by between 29% and 41% by 2030.  Enterprise Ireland is working with companies to meet this target and to embed sustainability as a strategic business priority, to meet changing customer demand and to remain competitive into the future. <\/p><p> During 2022, specific initiatives we will be undertaking to achieve this objective include delivering the climate enterprise action fund, which provides opportunities for companies with training and capability supports to accelerate awareness of abatement opportunities and to develop plans for lower-carbon products, processes and business models; and delivering the forthcoming carbon reduction fund, which will support enterprise investment in CO2 reducing technologies in manufacturing combustion processes.  We have a particular focus on identifying and engaging with client companies in high impact sectors such as food, cement and construction to support their development of strategic, long-term decarbonisation roadmaps.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland works with internationally focused construction products and services companies.  These companies make an important contribution to economic activity in Ireland, with exports of &euro;2.5 billion recorded in 2020 and providing employment across all regions of more than 40,000 people.  In common with other sectors of the economy, the construction sector is facing immediate challenges in the form of increased costs, including energy and through supply chain disruption, while addressing the longer-term strategic challenges of adapting to the digital and low carbon transition.  Through our funding, advisory and capability building supports and our overseas office network, Enterprise Ireland works directly with construction companies to respond to these immediate challenges and to support their long-term development and growth.  Our key areas of focus for the development of the sector include digitalisation, lean training to increase productivity, modern methods of manufacturing and product and process innovation. <\/p><p> In the area of sustainability, construction and cement companies are seeing growing customer demand, including through public procurement requirements for products and services that support lower levels of carbon embodiment.  In addition, they are facing up to the challenge of reducing their own carbon emissions in line with the climate action plan targets for enterprise.  Enterprise Ireland is engaging with companies in these sectors to identify their needs and to support the development and implementation of sustainability roadmaps to address these challenges. <\/p><p> Building upon our work with exporting companies, under the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All plan, Enterprise Ireland is delivering productivity, innovation and research supports to the domestic residential construction sector.  This is to achieve the objective of increasing productivity in this sector and reducing the cost of homebuilding.  After a period of industry consultation, the Built To Innovate campaign was launched by an T&aacute;naiste in March 2022.  The objective of this campaign, which will run over the next 36 months, is to work with homebuilders, general contractors and off-site manufacturing companies to enhance their capabilities and deliver innovation to the sector through new products or processes. <\/p><p> As the Government embarks on a major building and infrastructure investment programme, set out in the National Development Plan 2021-2030 and in Housing for All from 2021 to 2030, the delivery of productivity, research and innovation supports to the domestic-focused construction industry, as well as exporting companies, is being prioritised.  In partnership with the Government&rsquo;s construction sector group, Enterprise Ireland is leading the establishment of the construction technology centre.  The technology centre programme is a joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, allowing Irish companies and multinationals to work together on specific research projects, in collaboration with research institutions, often providing solutions to sector wide challenges.  The construction technology centre will join with the build digital project and the modern methods of construction initiative as the Government&rsquo;s technology infrastructure response to enabling a more integrated competitive, sustainable and digitally enhanced domestic construction sector.<\/p><p> Following a competitive process, in April of this year, the Enterprise Ireland board approved a proposal from a consortium of regionally balanced construction and built environment focused research groups across four third level institutions, namely, National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, Trinity College Dublin, TCD, University College Cork, UCC, and University College Dublin, UCD, working with the Irish Green Building Council.  The construction technology centre will be established in June this year and will be hosted by NUIG, which will provide the personnel, administration and institutional supports to the consortia. <\/p><p> The construction technology centre will focus on urgent construction and housing research challenges, defined by Government and industry but delivered in an accelerated manner.  The research focus will start in the urgent areas relating to productivity, affordability and cost; quality and safety; sustainability; skills and training; and collaboration.  With regard to sustainability, a significant part of the centre&rsquo;s work will be research to support companies involved in the retrofitting of existing structures and those involved in developing more sustainable processes for new construction. <\/p><p> The consortia will have access to and will work closely with the Irish Green Building Council on the identification of urgent and important issues and will work with industry stakeholders on the dissemination of results to inform changes and improve practices, processes and influence policy changes for the benefit on the sector. <\/p><p> Strengthening productivity and improving sustainability are key areas of focus for the construction sector and Enterprise Ireland, in the activities set out above, will continue to work with companies to deliver on these objectives.  I thank members for their attention and I and my colleagues are available to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Christal","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Christal for that opening statement.

I am here with my colleague, Ms Marion Jammet.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Green Building Council is currently working in close collaboration with the industry and key stakeholders to develop a roadmap to decarbonise Ireland's built environment.  The draft version of this roadmap will be published this week and open to consultation.  It includes a comprehensive set of recommendations to halve emissions by 2030 from the construction sector and to get to zero by 2050.  In order to baseline the current impact of the built environment, we commissioned UCD to model emissions associated with construction and the built environment for the 2018 baseline year.  These add up to 37% of our national CO2 emissions.  This is made up by 23% operational emissions associated with the energy we use to heat, cool and light our buildings.  A further 14% of the emissions are embodied carbon emissions from the production of construction materials, transport of materials, construction process, maintenance, repair and disposal of buildings and infrastructure.  The researchers also modelled the projected emissions from the built environment and construction to 2030 based on the national development plan.  This showed there would be a very significant increase in construction-related embodied carbon emissions if no action is taken.<\/p> <p>  To halve our emissions by 2030, we have to combine a number of strategies.  We will need to focus on energy renovation, maximise reuse of existing buildings, minimise demolition, maximise efficiency of the built area from our construction programmes and perhaps even cut back on some projects.  It will require us to eliminate the concept of waste and we will need a transformative shift in industry practices.<\/p> <p>  Twenty years ago we did not measure energy in a scientific way but the introduction of the building energy rating, BER, and the compliance software gave us a pathway to measure and revise regulations and we cut energy consumption in new homes by 70% in ten years.  We can now take the next step and eliminate all operational carbon emissions from new buildings, implementing a net zero carbon standard, and some businesses have already started on this path.<\/p><p>For existing building it means scaling up deep energy renovation.  Tools such as building renovation passports could support phased retrofits and project aggregation.  Developing new digital technologies can help accelerate deep energy renovation, for example, prefabrication such as the Dutch Energiesprong programme.<\/p><p> Unlike operational carbon emissions, embodied carbon is not regulated in Ireland.  With 400,000 homes to be built by 2030, addressing this blind spot is urgent to reach our climate targets.  To tackle these emissions we can use the same approach as with operational carbon, namely, measure and reduce.  Tools to measure embodied carbon already exist.  The European Commission&rsquo;s framework for sustainable buildings known as Level(s) gives us a detailed methodology.  We are developing good quality national data on construction products through EPD Ireland.  Easy-to-use calculation tools are available.  Already, hundreds of Irish building professionals have been trained in measuring embodied carbon.<\/p><p> Government should provide a timeline on the introduction of regulations on embodied carbon, starting with immediate mandatory measurement of every publicly procured building, with all other new buildings to measure and disclose before 2025.  Carbon limits should be introduced from 2027 onward.  Through measurement, building professionals will realise potential for materials efficiency and carbon savings, leading to a reduction in the cost of construction.  By stimulating action for carbon reduction, it will spark a whole wave of innovation in products, supply chains and services.<\/p><p> To reduce embodied carbon emissions we must use less materials and ensure the materials we use are low impact.  This means using more reused and recycled materials or bio-based materials which usually have a lower embodied carbon.  Public procurement is a strategic instrument which can be used to support innovation and drive the market for more sustainable solutions, allowing for scale-up in the industry and development of the entire supply chain.  This is needed to transition to low carbon methods of construction and circular use of materials.<\/p><p> Consistent and clear guidance on the safe use of timber structures must be provided.  Timber frame accounts for 75% of newly constructed homes in Scotland but only 24% in Ireland, despite our world-class timber frame manufacturers.  New local forestry and agriculture related industries to supply the construction sector must also be supported.  Other barriers to entry for new innovative materials to the market must be addressed without compromising safety.  A Government programme of capital and design support for projects that use innovative low carbon construction techniques could encourage private developers to quickly create exemplar projects and build towards commercial viability.  We need to reform Ireland&rsquo;s application of the waste framework directive to make it easier to reuse perfectly good materials coming off sites.  We need co-operation between Government and industry on risk sharing, particularly where there is market failure around insurance of non-traditional construction.<\/p><p> We have very limited time to significantly reduce our emissions.  Open collaboration between Departments and industry is critical for rapid development of new regulations and standards, and to share risk to scale new low carbon technologies.  However, an urgent first step is to measure and disclose embodied carbon.  Several European countries have already regulated embodied carbon.  The European Commission is moving us in that direction.  Given the growth in construction in Ireland, we cannot wait another five years to address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I will use slides as they allow some of the issues to be explained better.  We have written materials providing some detail.  To stir things up a little, I mentioned threats and opportunities.  Some issues are threats while others are opportunities and I have listed these.  We have woolly thinking versus real research and development; citation versus synthesis; and eco-bling versus real sustainable solutions.  The key to that is an imaginative and critical capacity, without which all the talk will not add up to much.<\/p> <p>  The approach we have taken in the OPW is to tie in with the EU approach.  In 1996, when I had just joined the OPW, Green Design was developed to equip the European Union.  This led to a whole approach.  Since then, especially in the past ten years, we have been using a green audit in every project we do.  Our green design roadmap, which will be ready this year, will be a huge positive.  It will bring together all the information and knowledge we have learned with colleagues elsewhere, including in the Irish Green Building Council and other private elements, to identify where this might lead us.  The roadmap describes the nine different areas we will cover.  These are the legal element; the procurement element; the role the State should play; what our targets should be; methods; stepping stones towards targets because there must be measurable and clear stepping stones; costs because everything should be open and clear like an open book; best practice in each case, which encompasses issues such as site and ecology, design and deep retrofit; and a glossary of items to provide clarity.  The map will also show how the stage guidance - the key steps as the EU calls it - will work.  We are tying it in to match the EU's system.  Areas to be covered extend from site selection through design, operation and restoration, in which the OPW has significant experience, to end of life and potential reuse.  The team players are also described.<\/p> <p>  We all know the legal context.  As Mr. Barry mentioned, operational carbon accounts for 23% of emissions, while materials comprise 14% of emissions.  How will we achieve our goals?  Fairness in competition has always been part of procurement in the EU.  Environment has now been added to that.  Life-cycle analysis and life-cycle costings will be important in that respect.  That approach needs scientific-based data.  The environmental impact must measured in terms of carbon emissions and embodied carbon.  This means a circular economy.  How do we manage that?  The different European standards and elements are very important for the steps shown on the blue slide.  Optimising power at work will also be important and the OPW has been doing for this for the past 12 years or so.  We have also started doing it with the HSE for hospitals.  In one of the key hospitals on the south-west side of Dublin, savings of 18% were achieved in one year just by bringing in certain methodologies of approach.<\/p> <p>  Embodied carbon has been mentioned.  What we need for that is a common language and a rating system in order that we can have comparable data, without which it is no use.  An open source is also necessary in order that everyone can see from where it is coming.  It will cover such issues as carbon, materials, water, health, comfort and climate aspects.  It will help build the economy.  An inventory of impacts and what their total impacts is a simple way to work out these issues.  I have given the examples of steel and glass in order that their significant impacts can be seen.  We changed our specifications in 2010 to bring in what is called green cement whereby waste from steel is mixed in.  This reduces carbon by one tonne for every tonne of cement used.<\/p> <p>  Forestry is a key element.  Over the years, I have done many projects in timber and we will do more.  To sustain forestry I suggest we follow the Scottish example which is by far the best example of all the European samples I have looked at.  Securing a licence covers all the other steps that need to be taken.  In Ireland we have different steps for different stages.  We also need to examine how much clear fell we do.  The right tree in the right place is a key element.  The tree is a transformative element in that it is a recycling factory for water and carbon and gives us oxygen and timber.<\/p><p>This is therefore a no-brainer.  Only 11% of our land is in timber and we should quickly get up to 20%.  The European average is much higher than that.  <\/p><p> I will give some detail on carbon capture.  We did research with colleagues elsewhere in other countries.  We can see on the right-hand side of the screen that different trees have different rates of carbon absorption.  Yet, some trees grow more quickly than others.  In the example of oak, it takes a full lifetime of an oak tree to absorb 123 tonnes of CO2, whereas a fast-growing alder, lime or horse chestnut does the same in approximately half the time.  Those little details are important from that point of view.  <\/p><p> On the issue of deep retrofit, we managed to get funding from the European Commission.  We have just started our work on it.  We are doing Tom Johnson House in Beggar's Bush as an exemplar retrofit.  It is a 1960s building and we are upgrading it to have an 85% reduction in its annual energy use.  It also will demonstrate an example of how you go about doing one of these things and how you make it significant.  <\/p><p> The last few slides show an example of a project we started 20 years ago in the Backweston campus, which is near Celbridge.  We made the rule then that no soil would leave the site or would go to a landfill.  That was at a time when that was still quite common.  We avoided landfill and we reduced the carbon footprint.  The committee members will be able to see the figures on the screen.  The amount of tonnage of CO2 that was saved by not moving the soil off-site was important.  More importantly, it was able to be reused and recycled in a way that was of benefit.  It is not a single-issue item, therefore but it achieves many things.  We had flooding near the area and we used the soil to act as contours but it does not look like a dam was built.  There is a built-in recreational area for people who are coming out of laboratories in a white outfit and into a landscape that gives relief to that.  There was also a significant cost.  The cost of moving the soil was significant.  It was over &euro;4 million.  We used approximately &euro;500,000 for planting the trees that we put on site.  The trees are a significant element in the reduction of the carbon footprint of that site.  <\/p><p> In summary, when you are faced with an issue, you must not just consider the issue in itself but what you can make of it and what that can be in the future.  From a sustainability and green-design perspective, many things must be considered at one time.  As for how that can be done, I suggest that looking at the site, the building and the running of the building, as well as the reuse of the building afterwards, are all key to this.  It is not simple, in that while the result can be simple, getting there takes a bit of effort and complexity.  However, that is there to be won.  I will finish by noting it is not for what it is but what else it can be.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O&rsquo;Connor.

I am joined by Mr. Richard Butler, from the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office.<\/p> <p>  I will set the scene by giving an outline of what we do.  We are quite a new office.  We were set up in 2019, which saw the function in Dublin City Council becoming a shared service with the National Building Control Office.  Then, in 2020, we were asked to take on the lead role for the national market surveillance office.  Effectively, the office is a shared service that operates as independent unit within Dublin City Council&rsquo;s planning, development and property department.  It is a paperless and fully remote office.  It provides for standardisation in the development and delivery of building control and market surveillance in the 31 local authorities.  It is fully funded by the local authorities.  Mr. Richard Shakespeare, the assistant chief executive of Dublin City Council, chairs an advisory committee to manage the unit on behalf of the 31 chief executives of the local authorities. <\/p> <p>  I will give members a brief overview of the work we do in building control in Ireland.  There are 31 building control and market surveillance authorities, usually known as building control authorities, and we operate under the legislative framework of the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, which regulate the design and construction of buildings and works in Ireland.  They provide for the health, safety and welfare of people in or about buildings.  That is the important part.  It is about the health, safety and welfare of people who are in or about buildings, as well as access for all, conservation of fuel and energy and the promotion of good building practice.  <\/p> <p>  Building control officers monitor the implementation of the construction products regulations, where they carry out market surveillance for compliance.  That is under EU Regulation No. 305\/2011, which prescribes the basic requirements for construction works.  It states that construction works as a whole, and in their separate parts, must be fit for their intended use.  That is the important part there.  In construction, in particular, consideration must be given to the health and safety of persons involved throughout the life cycle of the works.  Subject to normal maintenance, these basic requirements should be satisfied for a reasonable working life of a building, which is 50 to 60 years, before any major remediation should take place.  Building control authorities also have functions under the EU energy performance of building regulations, SI 243 of 2012.  That promotes improvement of the energy performance of buildings with the adoption of the methodology for calculating building energy ratings, BERs.  Building control authorities monitor and ensure and enforce that every building, before it is opened, occupied and the building is put up for sale or rent, must have a BER certificate.<\/p> <p>  In summary, the 31 designated building control authorities monitor compliance with building control, the European energy performance and building regulations and they carry out market surveillance for construction products regulations.  They have good powers of inspections.  Last year, they carried out 38,000 inspections on buildings in Ireland.  The year before, the figure was 17,852.  We must remember that the responsibility for compliance rests with the owners of the buildings and works, as well as with the designers and the builders, not with the building control authorities.  They have their functions under the Building Control Acts, the market surveillance of construction products and the building energy rating legislation.  They therefore operate under quite an extensive legislative framework.  I have provided the legislative framework surrounding building control and construction products in our submission to the committee.<\/p> <p>  For the purpose of this committee meeting, which is on carbon and energy in the construction industry, the fundamental requirement of building control authorities is that all buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the appropriate requirements of the building regulations in such a manner as to avoid breaching any other requirement.  No works can be carried out that would cause a new or a greater contravention in the building of any requirement.  There are 12 requirements under the Building Control Acts, namely, part A on structure; part B on fire safety; part C on site preparation and resistance to moisture; part D on materials and workmanship; part E on sound; part F on ventilation; part G on hygiene; part H on drainage and wastewater disposal; part J on heat producing appliances; part K on stairways, ladders, ramps and guards; part L on conservation of fuel and energy; and part M on access and use.  All of those must be complied with.  All buildings, subject to normal maintenance and wear and tear, should have a lifespan of 50 to 60 years, before any major remediation works are carried out.  It is all set out and must be complied with.  <\/p> <p>  As energy efficiency standards, that is, the requirement to reduce the carbon emissions and heat loss from buildings, rise, we have to remember that insulation, improvement and structure cannot be separated.  Consequently, to just go and retrofit these buildings without looking at parts A to M of the building regulations would be a no-no.  Risk assessment must be carried out for the impact on all the other parts of the regulations when a retrofit is considered.  I have included in our submission to the committee an example of what a risk assessment would look like.<\/p> <p>  Every product in building must be assessed as a whole and in its separate parts to ensure fitness for its intended use, considering in particular health, safety and welfare people.  This is because people are going to be living in these.  The Building Control Acts are for the health, safety and welfare of people in or about buildings.  In other words, when we improve part L, which pertains to conservation of fuel and energy, we must ensure that we are not causing a new or greater contravention to the other parts of the regulations, especially to part A on structure; part B on fire safety; and part C on site preparation and resistance to moisture.<\/p><p>This is because in the context of the relationship between air tightness and insulation, the level of radon may increase and that must be tested after upgrading the part L requirement.  The severity of exposure to wind and rain also must be considered when retrofitting.  For example, Donegal is a high exposure area, as opposed to Carlow, which is a lower exposure area.  Then you will be impacting on part F, pertaining to ventilation.  It is important not to look at upgrading without looking at the other parts of the regulations.  Parts F and L come as a set and the National Building Control Office will hold a continuous professional development, CPD, day on parts F and L on 5 May.  Members are welcome to join in person or online and the Eventbrite link is in our written submission.  Much insulation may be combustible.  Part D, on materials and workmanship, is probably the most important requirement of the buildings requirements and is not given the importance is requires.That part states: <\/p><blockquote>\tAll works to which these Regulations apply shall be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner. [...] To ensure a proper standard of workmanship, it is essential that persons are competent, possessing sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works. <\/blockquote><p>That is a big compliance challenge for building control officers.  Building control authorities in Ireland have consistently noted that Part D compliance challenges are the biggest impediment to compliance.  You can have lovely modular buildings and lovely factory production control and then they arrive on site and the competent people are not there to direct them.  That is a big issue.  The biggest impediments to compliance with building regulations are the serious lack of trained and competent builders and tradespeople in construction and lack of CPD for trained builders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mair&eacute;ad Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Phelan.

The technology centre is a unique piece of infrastructure.  It involves industry working with the State on agreed problems.  It is collaboration around agreed problems.  We have worked with a number of sectors and construction is one of the sectors that has not had a technology centre.  It allows industry, Government and academia to come into one space and look at a prioritised list of challenges.  It is a collaborative research challenge for industry and Government, because a large number of Departments work with the sector, and this will facilitate a professional approach to understanding the challenge, getting the best projects set up and the best researchers working on them.  For the first time, the construction sector will have that platform.<\/p> <p>  We use a hosting model.  We do not build anything.  We have eight technology centres and the construction one will be the ninth such centre.  We follow a format where we put out a request to the research providers to say this is an opportunity, that the industry has defined the issues and that we want them, on behalf of the research community, to gather the best people available and bring a proposal back to Enterprise Ireland on behalf of the industry.<\/p> <p>  That is what happened this year.  We put an expression of interest, EOI, out in December to inform the research community that this was coming.  We spent a year working with industry and integrating the Housing for All challenges that came out last September into five challenge areas.  They are noted in the statement.  The research community came together and we received three proposals in February.  We internationally reviewed those proposals and were able to bring a decision to the Enterprise Ireland board in April.  Because of the urgency of housing, we have taken a year out of the normal procurement process.  When I started on this there were three terms, namely, \"Very Urgent, \"Urgent\" and \"Short Term\".  Our chief executive, Leo Clancy, said if we were to do this we needed to do it fast.<\/p> <p>  We were able to fast-track a procurement process, internationally peer-review it and bring it to our board in April this year.  The winner of the competition was announced last week.  It is a combination of NUIG, as the host, working with University College Cork, Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and our colleagues on this call, the Irish Green Building Council.  The collaborators will work with Galway, Enterprise Ireland and the construction sector group to define the important areas under the five topics that were mentioned and will bring together the best brains, albeit with an industry drive.  That is the difference with the technology centre.  It is the delivery.  The problem is defined as an industrial problem, work is done by the best brains in industry and academia and the result will be delivered faster.<\/p> <p>  We hope the technology centre will be able to influence the industry and allow policymakers to see how best knowledge is taken.  Our colleagues have fantastic information on activities in this space and we hope the technology centre will bring the input of Mr. Barry and the Irish Green Building Council, among others, into play on those five areas.  Industry and Government will define what are the most important areas.  Housing has taken up a huge input.  When we sit down with NUI Galway, as the host, and its collaborators, we will look at the five areas and how to accelerate excellent collaborative, industrial-led research in those areas.

In yesterday's edition of <i>The Guardian<\/i>, there was a wonderful article about an apartment scheme in Barcelona called La Borda that has just won the Mies van der Rohe award for emerging architecture.  I mention it because it will put the questions I have for the witnesses in context.  It is a passive build powered with solar and fully timber, so it is not just a timber frame but the vast majority of materials in it are timber.  Therefore, it is virtually zero carbon.  The cost of living there is 35% below the market.<\/p><p>For those of us who have made it our business to go out and search for these kind of models over the last while, right across Europe we are seeing high-quality residential developments, including houses, duplexes and apartments, that are built to the highest possible energy efficiency standards with the lowest levels of embodied carbon, and they are significantly cheaper than what we are seeing in traditional builds here.  At other committees meetings I have spoken about some projects I have seen in London local authorities where they are building timber frame and fully timber apartment developments and it is costing them about &euro;1,000 less per square metre than a traditional build would.  These are at the passive house plus standard with low, and in some cases no, embodied carbon.  The reason I am mentioning all of that is that if all of this stuff is happening elsewhere, why are we not seeing more of it here?  The reason we invited the organisations today is that many of us on the committee are aware of the good work they are doing.  We are aware they have taken that work to a certain level but it seems to me that if we want to bring it to the next phase, whether it is some Irish architectural practice in a co-operative somewhere in Finglas, Ballymun or Clondalkin in my constituency, winning the next architectural prize, there needs to be a level of political acceleration of the advice the witnesses are here to give us.  I ask the witnesses to be a little less diplomatic in their responses to the following questions on how we move this to the next level.<\/p><p> I refer to Enterprise Ireland.  There are lots of companies already doing this technology in Ireland and when we talk to them they say they are frustrated about not being able to expand to the level of scale that is required to supply the Irish market.  What needs to be done to assist these companies - in addition to the technology centre, which is vital - already producing the good quality material, to allow them to scale up and start supplying the Irish market at a level they currently cannot?<\/p><p> I will turn to Ms Phelan and the National Building Control Office.  One of the big issues for building control is when we are using timber products there is that 10 m height restriction on residential developments.  If we were to start to look at taller buildings and mid-rise, high-density apartment developments using a lot of this high-grade timber, what changes would we need to make to our building control and fire safety regulations to ensure we were not just building more environmentally sustainable buildings but that they also met the highest possible standards of fire safety and building control?  We have a questionable history in some of these areas, so what would need to be done to ensure that if we are to use those technologies beyond 10 m in height it would be done in the safest possible way?<\/p><p> I will turn to Mr. Barry and Ms Jammet.  I am taken by the call from Corinne Sawers and Eric Lonergan for supercharged incentives to get industry moving.  When we spoke to the Department the other day it made a comparison with BER, which is great but it was slow and, as was said, we do not have that time.  How do we supercharge industry?  What kind of positive incentives can Government put into the marketplace to make sure people choose the lower carbon products over the dirtier ones?  Do we need to also start thinking about timelines for phasing out high-carbon cement, concrete and other things?<\/p><p> I will put the difficult question to Mr. O'Connor because the State has to lead.  If we are saying all this needs to be done, then every public building project should be at the cutting edge of this.  How do we ensure that on State building projects, particularly public housing, because housing is the primary interest of this committee, including community centres and public libraries, the State is doing its best?  The State must be leading the way and showing how high-quality, low-embodied carbon and cheaper to produce buildings can be built as we roll out the Government&rsquo;s housing programme.<\/p><p> I will come back to some of those questions in the second round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#E00700","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":739,"content":"<p>We will start with Enterprise Ireland and we can come back to some of the questions if we do not have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#F00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Colmain, to comment but the Deputy picks up a really important point which is at the heart of our strategy, namely, the ability of Irish companies to scale and grow at a rate that enables them to respond to the market challenges, domestically and internationally, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland.  It is a big cornerstone of our strategy to try to encourage companies to go on that scaling journey, including through research and development and through making them more competitive through their funding models.

Our message continues to be the same today.  Whether it is a services company or a materials or product company, they should look to further markets where there is greater scale for them to produce.  That will give them the assurance they need to make the necessary capital or research investment to produce those products and we support them with that.<\/p> <p>  Second, the action under Housing for All calls on us to help companies with productivity, research and innovation.

For example, under technical guidance document A, buildings must stand up and they must stand up for 50 years.  Technical guidance documents also give guidance for a non-complex dwelling.

Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Barry mentioned Scotland.  They both came at it from different perspectives but they really shone a light on where it is really working from a timber frame perspective.  I would be keen to know if there are any learnings they think we, as legislators, should be introducing, either as legislation or as best practice guidelines, to try to push that agenda in Ireland from an environmental perspective and, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned, from an affordability perspective?<\/p> <p>  On affordability and savings, it was good to hear Mr. Barry talk about the 70% energy saving.  I want to check that I interpreted it correctly that there is a 70% energy saving in new homes as a result of the BER in the past decade.  While that is not surprising it is quite striking when you think of it.  I ask Mr. Barry to clarify that is correct.  The Celbridge project Mr. O'Connor spoke about was interesting from a savings and an environmental perspective.  Avoiding landfill to reduce carbon footprint is something that is happening in my constituency.  For example, there is a project in Saggart where they are trying their hardest to do that.<\/p> <p>  I am also struck by the level of deep and meaningful work that is being carried out by both the OPW and Enterprise Ireland on this issue.  I am interested to hear what level of collaboration there can be between the public and private sectors on this best practice sharing.  The guidelines that are being drawn up seem so far-reaching.  Is that the kind of information, from a procurement and design perspective, that could be utilised by private industry?<\/p><p> To go a little off topic, it is great to hear, in respect of the building control reforms, about the number of site inspections being carried out.  The establishment of the National Building Control Office has been a key part of the building control reform agenda that the Government has had.  It is really great to see the amount of work that Ms Phelan and her team are carrying out.<\/p><p> Could I get the perspectives on Scotland and clarification on savings?  Could I have a little information on collaboration between the public and private sectors, particularly between Enterprise Ireland and the OPW?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#F00900","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":748,"content":"<p>With regard to timber, Scotland has a very similar but wetter climate than ours, yet it is using a higher quantum of timber frames.  As Mr. Barry mentioned, we are at about 23% in housing while Scotland is at approximately 75%.  Part of the problem we have is that we are importing timber from Scotland.  For instance, Glennon Brothers in the midlands, in Longford, are importing about 400 cu. m of timber every year to keep their mill going.  There is an imbalance when that has to be done.  Part of the reason is that we have stalled.  We did very well for some time.  When Ireland became independent, it had forest cover of 1%.  It now has cover of 12%.  Members of all Governments played a role in that.  To move from 11% or 12% to between 18% and  20%, we need to get farmers to plant.  That depends on the land.  The land we have had to date suits certain types of trees.  Better land allows for more diversity in what is grown.  Sometimes people say it is a question of either conifers or broadleafs.  It is not really a question of either-or but of and - both have a role to play in forestry, including in embodying carbon and reducing the carbon footprint.<\/p> <p>  Our system is set up such that separate licences have to be got for planting, putting in the road, extracting and clear-felling.  To me, that does not make sense.  The Scots have just one licence.  Why can we not do that?  What has happened is that we have made the process too academic and overly structured.  We need to simplify it.  We must ask what terrible thing has happened in Scotland that would have us not take the same approach here.  No such thing has happened.  We can learn from that.<\/p> <p>  We could also learn from the Austrians and the French in that they do not clear-fell at the same scale as us.  We do a much bigger clear-fell as a percentage of the woodland.  That has to do with how trees are planted, the species planted and the mix.  The Austrians and French have a zero-bare-canopy approach.  That is achievable, but there must be different forestry methodologies.  Coillte is interested in this.  We have had meetings with Coillte.<\/p> <p>  There was a related question on levels of co-operation.  We are co-operating with Coillte on the third iteration of a publication - Wood Specification - we first produced with it 12 years ago.  We have a masonry culture in Ireland and must ask how we can introduce a timber culture.  When I worked in Scandinavia and Canada for many years, those regions had timber cultures because that is the way they have grown up.  We have grown up with a masonry culture but now need timber-based technology at an equal level.  People have to treat timber with respect.  If they do not, it rots and things happen to it.  There has to be a knowledge base.  This is why the technology element, which was spoken about earlier, is very important.  Wood Specification will give people the knowledge base.  We are now turning it into something that can be downloaded.  The content will be much easier to interact with rather than that in a book.  We will have it ready for the end of the year.  These are small steps but they are important.  In the process, we co-operated with many individuals, including representatives from Coillte.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is part-funding the book.  These are important elements.<\/p> <p>  It is easy to say we can get a pile of timber but it is a matter of what you do with it and how you put it through a process.  We must ask what side industries can be had.  The Finns, for example, have a furniture industry based on timber, in addition to paper, manufacturing and construction industries.  We need to get that mix.  Our economy is a bit too small in some regards, and we are a bit more remote.  The Finns, by contrast, can go right into the rest of Europe from the south of their country.  These are things we have to recognise.<\/p> <p>  Another topic to be considered is cross-laminated timber.  This is what is being used for the high-rise buildings.  This is achievable if you have a market of a certain size.  At the moment, we do not, but we could, depending on how we treat our next number of steps with our growing population.  These are all possibilities but, as with everything that is possible, we must ask what can really be made happen and those things that are a bit further away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":749,"content":"<p>We require a 70% reduction through the building regulations.

It is the cross-laminated timber, CLT, which is the timber that allows us to build high, for instance, 11- or 12-storey buildings in London, 18 stories in Sweden and the same in Vienna.  Those countries have used CLT, which is very fine bits of timber glued together.  It can span up to 20 m and sometimes up to 30 m so it can give huge spans.  For us, its problem is twofold: there is nobody making CLT in Ireland and we only need about three plants in Europe to cover the whole European market.  The Finns have that fairly well cornered at present.  That will spread, but CLT gives rise to being able to do high-rise building.<\/p> <p>  What holds that back are the fire issues, such as those in Grenfell Tower and others, and how we protect against them.  Very recently, the Australians have decided they want that type of building to happen under two conditions.  One is that a sprinkler system is brought into the building, which adds significant cost, or the building is clad with a fireproof material in front of that timber.  In Sweden and Norway that was not required, rather, a painted finish was required to be put on to achieve that.  In Ireland, however, there tends not to be enthusiasm for what people see as temporary application of a fire retardant because after about eight to ten years, it is supposed to be reapplied. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I am just out time on that.

I will focus on three of the submissions, given the time constraint.  I understand the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office is an independent unit within Dublin City Council funded by the 31 local authorities.  Will its representatives touch very briefly on that structure, independence and how they operate there?  There is an interesting point in the office's submission to the committee:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBuilding Control Authorities in Ireland have consistently noted that Part D compliance challenges is the biggest impediment to compliance [with] the requirements of the Building Regulations [and a] serious lack of trained\/competent builders, trades people in construction, and [a] lack of CPD for trained builders. <\/blockquote> <p>I am concerned about that.  The witnesses have identified issues but I would like to hear about solutions and the way they might address that matter.  Those are the two questions to the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office.<\/p><p>The OPW representatives touched on carbon capture and sustainable forestry.  This is a recurring theme in the Irish Green Building Council's submission today.  Its representatives talked about the need for support streamlining of new forestry licences and procedures.  I am on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Forestry is part of that committee's remit and we have looked at this in great detail.  The OPW has come in and said more or less the same thing, which is a concern we all know about.  Will the OPW witnesses talk to us about their engagement with Coillte and how that has gone?  That is important.<\/p><p>I will turn briefly to the Irish Green Building Council.  We know its role is to advocate and educate in addition to developing tools to facilitate the transition to a sustainable built environment.  Its submission mentioned enabling innovation and reducing carbon emissions, etc.  The issue I want to raise relates to the fact that in its submission, it identifies that new local forestry and agriculture related industries and the supply of the construction sector must be supported.  More specifically, the current system for licensing of forestry planting and felling must be reformed to ensure a supply of timber.  Again, it is that recurring theme of timber.  Is the council referring to the all-inclusive licensing that does all the various stages?  Is that part of the solution it is talking about?  The council also states that construction and demolition account for 48% of all waste produced in Ireland, which is alarming.  Its submission further states, &quot;Ireland&rsquo;s application of the Waste Framework Directive makes reuse of perfectly good materials difficult for all but the largest sites and contractors, so reform is urgent.&quot;  Will the council elaborate on what it envisages regarding that?<\/p><p>These are just some points and questions.

We are what is called a shared service.  The shared services initiative was one of the Government reform programmes for local government.  The County and City Management Association, CCMA, realised we had a severe difficulty in implementing building control in Ireland.  The CCMA provided for one unit to do a standardised implementation of building control across the 31 local authorities, and one IT system for submission of fire safety certificate commencement notices, so that we would have one standardised system throughout the country.  We in the office can then look at every single submission and commencement in the whole country, risk-assess it, look at who is doing what, look at who is building what and where, consider how they are showing compliance with the requirements of the building regulations, and look at the standard of drawings and compliance documentation that is submitted.  It is paid for out of the purses of every single local authority based on size.  Dublin City Council, being the largest local authority, obviously pays the most to support the office.<\/p> <p>  On part D of the building regulations and competent builders, the big problem in Ireland is we have this attitude that anybody can build and that is not so.  Building is a science that people need to learn.  We had the master craftsman, the master builder and the City And Guilds years ago, and a guy or girl served their time for a number of years with a small or large master builder.  We now have a situation where anybody can call himself or herself a builder and anybody can submit a commencement notice.  That is a major issue.  The training of craftspeople apprentices is not that visible.  If we look at the apprenticeships online for people, there are very few positions.  As an industry, we need to provide a situation where crafts, such as plasterers, block layers, builders and carpenters, are a first-line opportunity for leaving certificate students as opposed to a fallback position.<\/p><p>It is a big problem for us.  We spend quite a lot of our time on sites explaining to builders how to build and read the instructions on the products and asking them whether the product they are using is fit for purpose, whether they checked the rain and exposure conditions, what they are going to use it for and if it will work with the other products they are using.  That is the biggest problem we face.  I am not sure how to rectify it but we need a training system, competent builders and a register of proper builders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Mair&eacute;ad Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the questions but I think what Ms Phelan told us today regarding builders and construction is alarming.

The farming industry will say it does not want to lose land.  We must get a balance where people see it is economically viable to do so.  It works very well in the United States, funnily enough, where most of the forests they harvest are naturally grown.  The farmer cuts down his or her woodland every 20 years to pay for whenever his or her children go to college or whatever.  It is within a system but they have it very well-balanced because since 1908, the Americans knew the quantum of timber that was in their country and what they did about building with it.  They have had those building blocks for many years.  We could learn a lot from looking at how the Americans went about it.<\/p> <p>  We need to get more land under timber and ask what the methodologies of positives are.  On the positives, when I came back from working in Canada and worked on a project for Irish timber many years ago, we found that the industry did not have the right mix, almost like the building industry.  We did not have people who could dry wood or stress grade it.  All of that is now in place in Ireland.  What we need is the quantum to put through so that a company like Glennon Brothers does not have to bring that quantum in from Scotland to keep its factory going.  If we want to do that, that is what we need.  Glennon Brothers developed markets abroad in Japan, England and elsewhere.  Therefore, the capacity is there now.  The calibre of people operating - certainly in the top five mills - is second to none.  The quantum is what we need.  We need to maybe leave outside the door our view that a conifer equals a bad tree and a broadleaf equals good.  There is room for both and both need to be accommodated.  The land quality decides the variability of what one can plant.  If one does not have decent enough land, one cannot grow oak whereas spruce and others will grow on that land.  It is trying to get that balance.  At the moment, there are parts of the country in which people feel too many trees are being planted, like County Leitrim.  People feel there are too many trees and they do not want that.  We must, therefore, get a balance.  We also have to do it with the farming community, however, in order that the it can see why it should transition from what it is doing at the moment to a different area.  It must be economically viable for farmers to do so, however.

That will hopefully get approval in the next two months or so.  Ireland as part of the European Union is a very small quantum of the use of that, even if we get to a much higher use than we do at the moment.  Therefore, we are always going to have to import it.<\/p> <p>  For instance, the way the Finns have done it, they can produce nearly half the quantity of what Europe needs in one plant in the south of Finland.  They took the view eight years ago that they were going to invest in that and now they are getting the benefit.  Eight years ago, people were not sure whether that technology would translate across but now with these pioneer buildings, it has been proven that it does work.  The next step is to ask whether we need to have that as part of our kit, as it were, to build for density.  It brings in the argument of what level of height we build to.  Even to build to reasonable heights without going too high, however, having the advantage of cross-laminated timber is possible.  Research has been done on that in National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway.  We know from examples Coillte had made in Austria that Irish timber would be suitable.  The question is how we now partner to go forward as a country.  We must also then have the right quantum of timber to do that.  We cannot set something up and not be able to feed it.

Some companies are providing good-quality products.  Those products might not be CLT, but they are comparable to CLT in terms of what they do.  These companies need capital investment, which Enterprise Ireland can provide.  They also need to be able to secure orders so that they can build factories and scale up.  However, accessing the public procurement system is difficult because they are new and innovative companies with a new product that does not necessarily have a history.  How do we kick-start this?  Should we be making a case for using the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF?  Should we consider changing the procurement methodologies so as to score additional points to companies with lower carbon building products and so on?<\/p> <p>  I asked about buildings taller than 10 m.  If we sought to move to fully timber buildings above 10 m &ndash; these would not be high-rise buildings, but mid-rise ones of six to eight storeys &ndash; what kinds of issue would we need to be considering from a fire safety point of view?  Would we have to use double stairwells or mix concrete stairwells with CLT building frames?  Is there a discussion around how we can ensure that such buildings are fully fire safety compliant?<\/p> <p>  I know what Mr. Barry and Ms Jammet want the Government and industry to do, but what are their proposals and ideas and what have they learned from other jurisdictions about how we can get them to do it?  What positive incentives can be put into the system?  When the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage appeared before us, the Chair shared my nervousness about how all of its focus was on working with the EU to agree the accounting methodology under the frameworks.  However, it was less clear on how we would make the shift once all of those frameworks were in place, the products had certifications and we knew and agreed the volume of embodied carbon.  Many vested interests in our building industry are wedded to the old dirty technologies.  How do we move them on?<\/p> <p>  I will change my question to Mr. O'Connor because he gave some good answers to my previous one.  Do we really need to import timber from Finland?  It we want the lowest possible embodied carbon, we should be importing as little as possible.  If there is an Irish company with comparable technology and working with the innovation centre, surely we should be encouraging it.

I have a couple of, hopefully, short questions and they can come back to me at the end with the answers.<\/p> <p>  On the zero-carbon initiative, obviously we were aspiring to it at every level in construction.  This question is probably for Ms Phelan.  On the deep retrofit that is being done across the local authority housing stock at the moment, is she satisfied that it is up to sufficient standard and compliant to bring us to zero carbon?<\/p> <p>  On Enterprise Ireland, I have seen first-hand the excellent work it is doing on modular building.  We are very fortunate to have Framespace Solutions in Longford town.  In terms of the number of players we have across the country at the minute, has the agency identified what our capacity is for modular home building at the minute?  How many units can be produced?  How quickly can those companies scale up?  Where can we get to in respect of future build?<\/p> <p>  The Green Building Council raised a point, but it is probably something that Ms Phelan might be able to answer better.  The Chair referenced this as well.  On the pre-demolition audits, which are not a statutory requirement of the planning process, is there a tabulated form where we can see how many local authorities have ever requested those and how many are being requested?  Is the number increasing or is it something that is not being used, except in exceptional circumstances?<\/p> <p>  Some of my colleagues on the committee who are also on the agriculture committee will have been delighted to hear Mr. O&rsquo;Connor speak so passionately and eloquently about forestry.  If we are to go for zero carbon, we need an awful lot more timber.  It is very frustrating.  While we have been in this meeting, the latest forestry report, which we get on a weekly basis, came through to us.  We see that the number of afforestation licences issued in the month of April was down almost 50% on the previous year.  <\/p> <p>  I suppose Mr. O&rsquo;Connor is engaging at different levels.  However, I ask about his engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and specifically in regard to forestry, because it is an issue that has dominated the agriculture committee in terms of our dismay with the issuing of licences.  It was great to hear Mr. O&rsquo;Connor speaking about Glennon Brothers.  I live not too far way and I pass by its excellent facility in Longford.  I know it and so many other players in forestry and timber production are aghast at the delays in this sector at the moment.  In a nub, how engaged is Mr. O&rsquo;Connor with the Department, specifically on licensing?  He has given us great feedback on what needs to change there.  Has that been fed through to the Department?  Is it a two-way process?  Does he feel it is taking heed of the issues that it has with licensing?  Does he see a situation where that will change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#L00800","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":794,"content":"<p>On the local authority retrofit scheme, they would be quite well designed within the local authority framework.

Last Thursday I met Coillte to see how those elements could be looked at properly and in a wider context.  It falls into different contexts.  Licensing is one but the quantum of the timber is the other.  Licences for licences' sake are no use unless they have a product at the end of them.  That is where we need to be.  It has to be made viable for farming to put aside land for forestry because it takes time for that to repay.<\/p><p> People's view is that they are guessing at the future and they do not know what the future is, yet if we were to elaborate what we need in Ireland, it would be clear that we have to have more timber.  Every other country does.  The average European country's timber makes up more than 40% of its land.  We are the only country in which it is this low.  It is a no-brainer but the question is of building momentum and people buying into it.  Buying into it will be the biggest issue because it is not immediate.  People do not see an immediate cash crop the following year.  They will have to wait a bit.<\/p><p> With regard to what Deputy &Oacute; Broin was asking, if one does not have the raw material, all the rest is supposition.  It does not amount to anything.  One has to have the raw material.  The raw material is ecologically sound.  Why can we not do that?  We could make it an objective to achieve because it supports the reduction of carbon.  When one does a comparison with reduction of carbon is when timber gains its strength.  Until one has to account for one's carbon, why would one bother changing?  I am being very crude.<\/p><p> If one brings in the system where one has to measure, which we have done in our own projects, it will be patently obvious that one has to move to a different material.  One cannot use certain types of concretes.  Concrete has a role to play but it is not the only role to play.  Getting that balance is the key and then putting that within the context of what the nation needs.  The nation needs it.  The question is at what level of priority is Government told to execute it.  Those are the balances.  If one does not have those balances right, the forestry element will always be the second or third league, whereas it needs to move up to the first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#L02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":812,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor has talked himself into an appearance at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#M00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I might not be let out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":814,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor can take that as an invite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#M00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":815,"content":"<p>Or a threat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#M00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their time and briefings which are most welcome.

From what I understand it will double in the next 20 years.  There is a lot of timber coming.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Barry noted, 14% of embodied carbon emissions come from the construction sector and this has risen in recent times.  Other EU jurisdictions are moving forward faster than the EU to put in place embodied carbon targets.  However, from briefings to date that I have had from Departments and other stakeholders, we are waiting for EU protocols.  We are waiting until 2025 when the EU has its position that we can work from.<\/p> <p>  This is in contrast to how we embraced energy reduction in buildings with Partel.

It is quite tricky to be accurate about it but I will try.  I am aware of what other countries are doing.  On a personal level I think we should set the targets and start doing it sooner.  It is like many things.  In Ireland we are very good at talking in generalities but when we come down to the hard graft or master planning our future we can be a little hit and miss.  We are very good on our feet in a crisis but planning before the crisis could sometimes be better.<\/p> <p>  In that regard for any country to hit its targets for 2030, it has to move earlier, because there is always a time lag between industry catching up and all those ducks one has to line up in a row.  I favour it.  I am not sure whether the system can manage to do it significantly earlier but it could probably manage it two years earlier.  It should be achievable by 2023 but other people might take a different view.  I know other people who would have a diametrically-opposed view to that and say that the other systems are not ready.<\/p> <p>  However, we have to start doing it.  I would have no problem if the Legislature was to say that the public area is to now give that priority.  Then one starts finding out what the practicalities are and what the problems are in achieving them.  One will not get that by talking in the abstract.  It is not until one commits and sees what does not work out as well as one would have thought.

Until one trials one does not get it.  <\/p> <p>  We are watching what other countries are doing.  I am very aware of what the Danes are doing and they are quite ahead.  The Dutch are quite ahead of us as well.  However, many other countries, especially in southern Europe, are miles behind us.  There is that dichotomy between north and south Europe.  The Danes, Finns and Norwegians are better examples for us.  They are closer to us in size.  Their economy size is better and that is easier.

That person is quite dependent on subcontractors and people who sell the individual components of the house and may end up with a house that is lacking in compliance.  Richard might elaborate more on that.  He was on a site yesterday where they had no expansion joints and were missing damp-proof courses, DPCs.  They had not got their very high exposure area where a designed render would be required over the block to make sure water does not get in.  These are the issues we encounter on a daily basis.  The fact that anybody can put a label \"builder\" on the side of their truck is quite depressing.  People need to be trained and need to comply with Part 8M of the building regulations.  The competency element was probably lacking in many of the defects picked up by the defects committee.<\/p> <p>  We find modular construction excellent.  There are great forms of construction and of innovative design but when it arrives on-site we do not have trained personnel, trained fabricators, on site.  We have insulated concrete formwork, timber frame and all sorts of other types of construction.  It arrives on site and the guys on site have never seen it before and they stick it together.  We come to the site and have to stop construction and explain to them what to do.  That is an issue.  All those modular buildings come with instructions and the majority of them have an agr&eacute;ment certificate, which states only a competent designer or competent builder should be in charge of it.  They should probably be accompanied by trained fabricators.  Many good producers of modular buildings will not sell their products to an ordinary builder.  They will do it themselves.  We are finding that to be the case.

The main problem is people are not incentivised to go on this training course because they will be competing with someone who has not upskilled for the same job.

It is helpful for us in the committee to get our heads around this.  It is important we are clear that we are talking about different types of technologies.  It took me a fair amount of time to understand the difference between a timber frame versus a modular versus a cross-laminated timber, CLT, and some of the variants.  Once we have those measurements in place it allows us to see which are the best in terms of the lowest levels of embodied carbon.  A timber frame is good but it is not good enough in terms of where we ultimately want to be.  The Irish Green Building Council might respond to my original question, as the witnesses have not had a chance to do so.  I am interested to hear more from Ms Mark Christal and his team on where the industry is at in the really high quality lowest possible carbon product.  We already have companies in Ireland which are producing a product not unlike CLT.  It is not the same, the technology is different but as far as I can see it produces the same output in terms of the low levels of embodied carbon.  I would be interested to hear where that sector is at.  However, first, Mr. Barry or Ms Jammet might revisit the question of the type of positive incentives that could be introduced.  Let us imagine that they are in charge of the world and we have our measurements in place by 2023.  That is all very well but we must have the incentives in place to ensure the industry and the public sector make that transition as quickly as possible afterwards to the lower carbon technology.  What is their shopping list of the incentives they would like to see from the Government that we might recommend to it in whatever output we have from these sessions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#N02000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I will not return to the barriers but even if we take the introduction of new innovative materials, one has all the costs of certification.  We will have to support people who develop new products and the costs of certification and agr&eacute;ment certification are quite considerable.  We will have to help them with those.  Enterprise Ireland has been doing very good work in helping indigenous companies develop environmental product declarations.  Once we have an environmental product declaration, we have the numbers for that product.  Then we can say one has an environmental production declaration for this product and it has a global warming potential of so many kilos, and someone else has the same product and it has a much lower value.<\/p><p>The SEAI has what is called the accelerated capital allowance scheme for the most energy-efficient products.  We could do something around an accelerated allowance for the most carbon-efficient products.  That works at the product level, but if we are looking at systems then we must measure, for example, CLT in the overall building and not just as a product.  That is where we have to do the measurement and that is where we are looking at the potential within public procurement to introduce a shadow price for the carbon onto the cost of the building.  When one gets a tender, one also applies a shadow price to the tender, and it is the total cost of the shadow price plus the economic price.<\/p><p> We could also look at measures like VAT on products.  We could consider reducing VAT from 13.5% to 9% on lower carbon products, if it is performing at 50% below a similar product in a category.  There are a number of ways we can approach it, but there is no silver bullet, because it will be a combination of removing barriers and giving slight incentives to improve.<\/p><p> The U taxonomy will help there as well because that will require initially measurement of embodied carbon in buildings.  If a company wants to call its building green or if a bank wants to issue a green bond and to give a green loan, then it has to have done the embodied carbon measurement and the next step will be to introduce carbon limits.  If one is below a certain limit level, then one will get a green loan.  There is a whole combination of incentives like that which could be combined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#N02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I will call on my colleagues, Mr. O'Colmain and Mr. Kerrigan, in a moment.

Our UK office in particular has run a series around net zero in the UK.  What that means for us is that companies will then invest in developing capabilities to meet the market demand and we are there to support them when they are doing it.<\/p> <p>  If I may, I will give one example to illustrate the point.  A precast concrete panel manufacturer came to us who is exporting into the UK market.  It is seeing that the demands for public and private procurement is quite exacting around the carbon content of the panels.  We were happy to provide the company with the support it sought to develop an innovative panel by incorporating different fibres that would reduce the thickness of the cement panel ultimately from 150 mm to 20 mm.  This would be cladding on the exterior of buildings, perhaps even timber-framed buildings.

Construction has many impacts and we need to start measuring all of them.  It is a matter of weighting.  Some homes are very low-carbon to run but will have a large volume of embodied carbon.

I am saying this more for the benefit of the record and the work we will do after this, but we have a particular problem in our urban centres.  Building apartments, of which we need lots, is slow, expensive, dirty for the people who are working on-site, inefficient because of disruptions caused by rain and the natural environment, and involves a lot of embedded carbon.  One of the reasons a number of us on the committee, including the Chair, Deputy Duffy and others, are so keen to have this conversation is that we are seeing some of the new technologies we are talking about here fix a bunch of other problems in other jurisdictions.  For example, one of the great benefits of volumetric methods of construction is that much of the work is carried out in a factory, which means much better conditions for the workers.  Why are we finding it so difficult to get young apprentices?  It is not just that the work is insecure but that it is heavy, dirty and messy.  That is what young people tell us when we ask them why they will not take up these trades.  There is also less disruption from the elements and so on.  For me, the ideal end point, in some senses, is combining many of the benefits of volumetric construction with some of the flexibility of the panel systems.<\/p> <p>  We should also be a little bit innovative regarding exteriors.  I have seen some really wonderful mid-rise mixed-use apartment developments in London, England.  It is all cross laminated timber, CLT, construction but the homes have a traditional outer leaf of brick.  It is really thin, more of a brick facade, so the embodied-carbon footprint is very light.  For those who want to live in a brick building, it provides that kind of aesthetic security.  These are being built for &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,200 per square metre.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland tells us that the cost of building apartments in Dublin is &euro;3,000 or &euro;3,500 per square metre at the minute.  One of the things that is really exciting about this conversation is that not only could the green buildings of the future be produced - I take Mr. Barry's point that is not just about embodied or operational carbon but all those other issues as well but let us fight each battle as it comes to us - but labour conditions could be improved.  The speed at which apartment buildings are constructed could also be improved.<\/p><p>How long does it take to do an apartment development now?  It takes maybe two to three years from start to completion, whereas much of this can be done much more quickly.  If we are able to convince people, particularly those in senior decision-making levels of government, that there are multiple benefits from going down this route, without being simplistic about it, there will be so many different wins.  That is as well as the jobs in the timber industry and all of that.  It would be good if, at the end of these meetings, we could make a series of recommendations to the Government to promote that because there are so many wins.  We have had a series of battles in the past couple of weeks - I will not mention the turf war - over that element of the agenda.  Agriculture, when we start to see the sectoral targets, will be another big battle ground, yet in this area there seem to be so many obvious tangible wins.<\/p><p> To return to Ms Dwyer's point, the tools for the State to positively incentivise the good stuff are pretty uncontroversial.  That may not be the case for Cement Roadstone Holdings but it is for other actors.  It is one area where there are lots of positives.<\/p><p> Since we have not talked about the bad stuff, my final question is on cement.  Much of this conversation has been on how we incentivise the good stuff, measure and get the industry and public sector to use more.  Huge amounts of concrete and cement are used in construction, including in houses and apartments, yet we know from industry that it is no more expensive to produce lower carbon cement and concrete.  We are told the technology is available in the country.  I would like to ask each of the witnesses a final question.  While we are positively incentivising the good stuff, how do we get the bad stuff out of the system and how quickly can we do that?  Deputy Duffy and I have discussed this.  How difficult would it be to transition to 100% lower carbon cement?  Could it be done and how long would it take?  Is there a role for the Government to use incentives for the good stuff but also to set phase-out dates?  We have set a date for phasing out gas boilers in houses.  Even though we will not 100% phase out concrete completely as there will always be a role for it, particularly in fire safety, where is the conversation on that?  How do we make sure that as we get the good stuff, we phase out the dirtier stuff?  What is the timeline?  That is a question for everyone in the audience before we finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#P02000","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I will start and Mr. O&rsquo;Colmain may add to my response as he works with the Irish cement companies on a day-to-day basis.

Eventually, a peace was arrived at after the intervention of the Minister for Finance at the time.  We came up with a methodology where we used a set of stepping stones.  For instance, in all our specifications in the OPW, we have a minimum of 50% reduction.  What should happen is that all State organisations should be obliged to do that.  That should be made a rule.  I know people will say that is interfering with the market or whatever but if we are serious about it, this has to happen.<\/p> <p>  We have to recognise that in winter that type of cement takes a day or two longer to go off, which can have a cost or impact on scaffolding and so on.  However, once people get used to those things, they factor them in.  That issue should not be used as the first line of the block, where people argue that this material cannot be used in cold weather.  It can be used but it has to be propped for a day longer.  They should get over that and get on with their propping.

We happen to be close to one of the biggest producers of that substitute that can be added, whereas other countries are not.

There is a considerable opportunity when it comes to off-site construction.  We are traditionally held as a nation of builders, particularly in rural Ireland.  Longford is a case in point.  Mr. O'Colmain said he visited Framespace Solutions.  Porteus and Procon are also based in Longford.  There are number of leading off-site companies in the county.  Procon is working on the manufacture of four or five schools on-site at the moment.  Some 90% of the business of Porteus is in the UK at the moment.  It is dealing with a number of very big sites.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned apprenticeships and the need for upskilling.  We are seeing in off-site construction that there is an opportunity, particularly for young people, to upskill.  I have seen people who came into the industry as entry level labourers and quickly developed a whole new skill set.  They can be trained up.  It is an area of opportunity and I commend Enterprise Ireland on the work it has done in this area.  It is a space we need to get into in places such as the midlands.  Longford can become an epicentre for off-site construction.<\/p> <p>  We visited the Porteus facility recently with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and that was an informative day.  The dynamic of construction has changed.  Porteus makes pod bathrooms.  It is working on a site in south London at the moment.  Porteus has four hours to get 80 bathrooms onto site and get out again because time is money in the building trade.  People say that off-site construction is going to bring down construction costs.  It is not going to do that.  The saving relates to time.<\/p> <p>  The point is to ask what we need to be doing, particularly at local authority level.  In fairness to Longford County Council, it is making overtures in this regard.  Is this something that Enterprise Ireland and, indeed, the Government needs to be doing?  Do they need to tell local authorities they must engage with the off-site sector?  We have a high demand for social housing.

I have done research in recent years and I have been involved with Mr. O'Connor in that regard.  The Forest Statistics Ireland 2018 report from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine shows that Ireland imported approximately 250,000 cubic metres of sawn timber per year between 2010 and 2017.  In 2017, we exported 875,000 cubic metres, up from 658,000 cubic metres in 2010.  We are set to double that figure.  We export a hell of a lot more sawn timber than we import - three times the amount, in fact.<\/p> <p>  I travelled the country and talked to people in sawmills as part of an academic project intended to upskill students and encourage them into this sector.  We can continue to ship our timber to the UK.  That is where it is going  The British are building timber-frame houses with it.  One of the companies told me that Brexit will not effect that.  The British have a hunger for our timber and will continue to use it.  I do not know for how much that timber is being sold to the UK but we are exporting a lot more than we are importing and it is structural grade C16 timber, which is great for us.<\/p> <p>  In the context of embodied carbon, it is not just about the new building materials.  This is something I learned from Mr. Barry and the Green Building Council.  The London energy transformation initiative, LETI, refers to recycled materials which are brick skin.  I have worked on projects where there is an internal timber skin and the external skin is brick.  Going forward, the way LETI looks at it is that 80% of our materials need to be recycled.  That means the industry will be using recycled brick and lime water that can be reused.  That is a heavy embodied carbon material the first time around but that will not be the case if recycled brick is used the next time around.  There might be some issues with using lime water.<\/p> <p>  There are companies using timber frames and constructing them off-site.  Such frames are built to a higher level of precision in a factory and there are faster site times, which reduces costs.  It is a very different method of construction.  We are a wet trade country that uses blocks and mortar.  The timber space means that builders get onto site quicker, which reduces costs.  There are fewer people on-site and the number of accidents reduces.  The research shows that using timber is better for the construction industry but the problem is trying to educate all of us to know how to use it, as Mr. O'Connor could tell us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#R00500","speaker":"1574"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651532400,"counter":892,"content":"<p>We need a timber culture.

The methods of construction have to give it a long life and that is where we fall down a little bit in timber construction, or at least we did in the past.  We did not follow the proper way of building with timber and then people wondered why there was trouble.  That is what I mean when I talk about the timber culture.  We have to have people who actually know what they are doing.  What struck me when I worked in Scandinavia was that it was second nature to them.  One did not have to say things to them on site about watching out for this or that whereas in Ireland, up to very recently, one would have to be sitting on top of people to make sure they were doing the timber construction properly.  There is a higher level of supervision needed but as we develop and get the skill levels up, it will happen more automatically.  We are in a gear-change period and hopefully we can transition and have both types of construction at a similar level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I have one last question for Mr. O'Connor.

Norwegian spruce comes from Norway and that is what they use for their timber industry.  Spruce has a very long, thin trunk which makes for a very good log to timber conversion ratio whereas with broadleaf trees like oak, the sections are shorter.  That is why the forms of construction using oak are different to those using pine, for example.  I would emphasise the need to use both.  On the better land, we have the opportunity of growing more diverse trees but on certain other sites, the spruce is the right man for the job because he is a tough divil and he can do what is asked of him.  It is important in an industry where we need to supply, so we are not taking out virgin forest.  That is what I mean when I talk about sophistication.  It is not that the old <i>1984<\/i>rule applies, with two legs good and four legs bad.  Every tree in the right place has a job to do.  It is not a question of either-or but of both.  Then the question is how we select and what is the right selection process that supports an area environmentally.  We need a level of sophistication in the way we do it but not as a box ticking exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022050300002#S01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1651532400,"counter":905,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. O'Connor.
