Companies supported by Enterprise Ireland now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 375,000 jobs in the Irish economy. EI client companies total spend in the Irish economy in 2019 was &euro;28.12 billion delivering huge economic impact across every region and County in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) was established in 2014 and has become an important and effective channel to provide information and advisory support to indigenous local businesses.  The LEO network is a unique business support delivery mechanism, unrivalled in its success amongst comparable small and micro business support mechanisms in the EU.  In 2019, the LEOs, within allocated resources at that time, dealt with 7,400 client companies, supporting over 36,000 jobs.  The LEO budget has been increased from &euro;27.5 million to &euro;70.5 million since the onset of the pandemic to help microenterprises in business continuity planning and in establishing an on line presence.   <\/p>  <p>  Significant additional resources have also been provided to our Agencies in Budget 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD report refers to 250,000 active enterprises in Ireland of which 92% are microenterprises. Such a high number presents challenges in terms of the State&rsquo;s engagement with and support of enterprises in addition to ensuring compliance with the EU's state aid rules.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of expanding the eligible entities, the LEOs have already started on this route with last year&rsquo;s Productivity Fund which targeted an expanded cohort of enterprises (for employees up to 50) which would customarily not have qualified for funding as well as in the provision of Business Continuity Vouchers through the LEOs for small businesses with employment up to 50. Enterprise Ireland is also working with a broader base of non-exporting SMEs, such as through the Retail On-line Scheme and through its Covid 19 Sustaining Enterprise Fund. <\/p>  <p>  In that regard, legislative powers are available under Section 7 (1) (i) of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998 to require Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs to administer any schemes, grants and other financial facilities requiring the disbursement of European Union and such other funds as may from time to time be authorised by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  These powers have been used extensively in tackling the dual challenges of Brexit and Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever overarching institutional framework we have for developing micro businesses and SMEs, it is important that a benign environment is in place for SMEs to start up, scale up, to access international markets and to enable SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital and green economy. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, I have established the SME Growth Taskforce in follow up to a commitment in the Programme for Government in order to design a National SME Growth Plan that will map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint for SMEs and entrepreneurs beyond COVID-19.  <\/p>  <p>  The Task Force will also examine the recommendations in the 2019 OECD Report including the strategic framework and current delivery system for SME supports and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  This new Taskforce is composed of a broad range of business people with expertise in a range of sectors, as well as SME representative groups and other individuals uniquely positioned to contribute to a long-term vision for the SME sector and how best it can be supported.

My primary concern, as always in these situations, is for the workers and families who have been impacted by this decision. Many of these workers have been with the company for many years. The Government will make every State support available to those affected in order to help them transition and find new employment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA have worked hard to sustain and support the firm&rsquo;s presence here and have had close and regular contact with management, both at a local and corporate level. The IDA also provided support to employee representatives as they put together a plan for efficiency savings that could be made at the Ballinasloe plant.<\/p>  <p>  Now that the decision has been taken to close the facility, the IDA is working closely with the company to market the plant to potential investors. The IDA has introduced a number of companies who are interested in the Ballinasloe facility to Aptar management team and has also arranged visits to the site. <\/p>  <p>  Both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland will use the employee skills audit that has been carried out in their efforts to attract new investment to Ballinasloe. The IDA Regional team has also connected employees of Aptar with the local Intreo office as well as the Education and Training Board, Local Enterprise Office, Regional Skills Forum West and Galway Mervue Roscommon Training Centre.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and its Agencies have been working hard, over a sustained period, to support job creation in the regions. This has included setting ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country. County Galway has traditionally been a strong performer in terms of FDI and the IDA continues to draw the attention of clients looking to invest or expand in the County, including Ballinasloe. Last year, there were over 21,000 people employed in IDA-supported firms in Galway. This is almost double the number employed in 2010 (11,235). While the period ahead may prove more challenging, securing new foreign direct investment for our regions will be a key priority.<\/p>  <p>  Wider enterprise efforts are also underway to generate new growth in Galway and the surrounding area. For example, regional stakeholders &ndash; including Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and the Higher and Further Education Institutes &ndash; are working together on implementation of the Regional Enterprise Plan for the West. This is aimed at strengthening the environment for job creation in the region and Ballinasloe will also benefit from this.<\/p>  <p>  Another important initiative in this context is the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, through which over &euro;16.7m in funding for the West &ndash; over three competitive calls &ndash; has been approved for collaborative regional enterprise projects. The region has had particular recent success, with five Galway-based projects being awarded a total of &euro;9.6m. These projects are currently being developed and their completion will enhance the attractiveness of the area for further investment and job creation.<\/p>  <p>  While the announcement of job losses at Aptar is very disappointing, I want to assure you that the Government and its agencies are working to create employment opportunities in the West and across all of our regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500040#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500040#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[25980\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500040#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"his views on a report (details supplied); the analysis undertaken by his Department regarding the disproportionate effect on levels of employment as a result of Covid-19 in the north west region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus introduced a &euro;7 billion package of supports designed to help businesses across all regions to open, to help those already open to remain open, to get staff back to work and, for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, to secure new opportunities.

I want to see a situation where all towns, counties and regions across the country are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s nine Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 which were launched by my Department in early 2019 play a central role in supporting the delivery of balanced regional enterprise development and in ensuring that employment growth is spread across all regions. The Plans are maintained as &lsquo;live&rsquo; agendas which aim to be agile and responsive to both new opportunities and new challenges, for example: Brexit, Climate Action, Digital Economy, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic economic impacts.<\/p>  <p>  The principle behind the Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential. These stakeholders include: Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, the Higher Education Institutes and others. <\/p>  <p>  The Plans have a strong relevance for rural Ireland with actions focused on areas such as skills development, tourism, the food sector, agri-tech, the marine and maritime, regional enterprise co-working and remote working spaces, talent retention, and place-making.  <\/p>  <p>  At the end of June this year my predecessor as Minister, Heather Humphreys TD met with the Chairpersons of the nine Regional Enterprise Plan Committees on a conference call and invited them to work with their Committees to identify proposals that would help to address economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their region. These groups have met in virtual format and are reporting back to my Department with a view to contributing to the development of the National Economic Plan. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Government has put several funding streams and supports in place to support regional development and job creation.  For example, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will provide investment of &euro;1 billion into rural areas over the period 2019-2027 which will support projects that will have a transformational effect on towns, villages and rural areas across Ireland and further support job creation.  In addition, under my own Department&rsquo;s regional funding streams, over &euro;100m in funding has been provided under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) for projects across every region and over &euro;980k awarded under the Regional Technology Clustering Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus which introduced a &euro;7 billion package of supports, designed to help businesses across all regions to open, to help those already open to remain open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, to secure new opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that my colleague, Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Community, Rural Development and the Islands is currently developing the next phase of rural development policy, which will set out measures to support the economic and social needs of rural areas over the period 2020-2025, including actions to support employment in rural areas.  As was the case with the Action Plan for Rural Development 2017-2019 which was published in 2017, the new policy will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Community, Rural Development and the Islands also contributes directly to job creation in rural areas through programmes such the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and LEADER.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that over the last five years, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have focused on supporting enterprise growth and job creation throughout the regions. 65% of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2019 were outside the Dublin region, while regional investment increased by 50% over the past five years of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy &ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plans, and with all regional stakeholders working together, the regions are well positioned to realise their enterprise potential and see better quality, sustainable jobs and investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500040#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500040#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[30590\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500040#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"if a programme of financial assistance will be made available for the development of digital hubs in smaller towns to assist in job creation at local level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>On 12 August 2020, I launched a new &euro;12 million Enterprise Centre Fund, which will be administered by Enterprise Ireland, to help enterprise centres impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under the expanded scheme, the minimum grant is &euro;4,000 (up from &euro;2,000) and the new maximum grant is &euro;25,000 (up from &euro;10,000). The new scheme also has different criteria to the old scheme.<\/p>  <p>   As the Government decided to introduce the higher grant levels, to the benefit of a much larger group of businesses, it was decided to end the original scheme.

The past few months have been extremely difficult for Irish businesses. We have seen our small and medium enterprises work hard to adapt and to continue trading in the face of this profound disruption.<\/p>  <p>  This Scheme aims to provide supports for businesses that have been negatively impacted as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19.  It provides critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist in their trading needs.  It is available to SMEs, small Mid-Caps and primary producers.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme provides an 80% State guarantee on lending until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and five and a half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million including working capital and term loan facilities.  Loans up to &euro;250,000 are unsecured.<\/p>  <p>  While the new Credit Guarantee Scheme was only launched 4 weeks ago, as of 9th October, 900 business applications have now been recommended to the credit departments of the pillar banks for final approval to a value of almost &euro;48m. 400 applications have been approved to date for over &euro;21m: the number of loan facilities drawn almost doubled last week.    <\/p>  <p>  These loans are being drawn from all over the country, with businesses which have been deeply hit by the effects of the virus leading the way.  The wholesale and retail sector accounted for 22% of loans drawn by value, the accommodation and food services sector accounted for 14% of loans drawn by value, and the primary agricultural sector accounted for 10% of loans drawn by value, demonstrating that funding is getting to where it is most needed. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the high level of the State guarantee, loans are being provided at interest rates lower than the current market rate for similar loans.  This low-cost funding along with other grants which are available provides ready access to funding for businesses during this unprecedented time.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was developed in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework to take advantage of the relaxation of State Aid rules and a premium is charged in recognition of the State backed guarantee as required by the Temporary Framework.  <\/p>  <p>  A key focus of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is to make additional lending available to business for liquidity purposes and investment.  Businesses that without the guarantee might not otherwise be able to access these facilities.  Refinancing may be permitted in respect of COVID-19 related expenses that were funded through short term or temporary facilities such as overdrafts. However, any provision for potential refinance or rollover must have been agreed as part of the initial finance agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is currently available through Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.  In recognition of the need to make this Scheme as widely available as possible an open-call for new on-lenders has been completed and proposals are being reviewed by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in respect of potential new lenders.  I therefore expect to confirm a number of new lenders will be joining the Scheme in the coming weeks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2021","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[30592\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the supports his Department is providing for the SME sector through budget 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>Budget 2021 is a pro-business and pro-jobs Budget aimed at building on what we put in place in the July Stimulus, to help the self-employed, business owners and employees through this exceptionally difficult time.

The introduction of travel restrictions around the world is already, for example, disrupting the typical way in which the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, which are also faced by our competitor countries, IDA Ireland's results for the first six months of this year have demonstrated the resilience of our FDI base. The Agency has secured over 130 investments to date in 2020, which have the potential to create almost 10,000 jobs. Almost half of these new projects were secured for locations outside Dublin, with 53 investments from companies investing in Ireland for the first time. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that these 2020 investments reflect our continuing attractiveness to overseas firms. Overseas companies continue, the evidence would suggest, to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible work-force, a track record as a successful home to global businesses and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations and create jobs here.  <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, we do recognise that the global competition for FDI is intensifying and we are under no illusions that the time ahead will prove more challenging. We will have to fight, harder than ever before, for new investment projects and the jobs that go with them. I look forward, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to taking on that challenge. This will include working with the IDA on the formulation of a new strategy that will guide the Agency's work in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[25975\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the current economic situation and risks of further insolvencies in view of the circumstances surrounding closure of a company (details supplied); his views on the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report; and his plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the report.","asker":"1551","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>AWAITING REPLY FROM DEPARTMENT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC02700"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[29980\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500041#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the mechanisms of support available to a person seeking to establish a new business.","asker":"1451","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to anyone wishing to start or grow their own business.

It allows employers and employees to navigate the existing guidance easily and helps to inform those working from home during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  In July, my Department launched a public consultation on the existing guidance available on remote work to understand how this guidance could be improved. We received hundreds of responses to this from employers, employees, representative bodies and special interest groups.

The webpage will be updated regularly to reflect any changes made in response to the consultation with the first update due before the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Remote working is also an important part of the work of the enterprise agencies. For example, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional plan, &lsquo;Powering the Regions&rsquo; emphasises the importance of smart working. As part of this plan, Enterprise Ireland aims to support 10,000 co-working and incubation spaces in regional locations over three years.

As such, it contains a number of commitments to encourage remote working across our country. This includes the commitment to develop a national remote working strategy.

Companies supported by Enterprise Ireland now, directly and indirectly, account for more than 375,000 jobs in the Irish economy. EI client companies total spend in the Irish economy in 2019 was &euro;28.12 billion delivering huge economic impact across every region and County in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) was established in 2014 and has become an important and effective channel to provide information and advisory support to indigenous local businesses.  The LEO network is a unique business support delivery mechanism, unrivalled in its success amongst comparable small and micro business support mechanisms in the EU.  In 2019, the LEOs, within allocated resources at that time, dealt with 7,400 client companies, supporting over 36,000 jobs.  The LEO budget has been increased from &euro;27.5 million to &euro;70.5 million since the onset of the pandemic to help microenterprises in business continuity planning and in establishing an on line presence.   <\/p>  <p>  Significant additional resources have also been provided to our Agencies in Budget 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD report refers to 250,000 active enterprises in Ireland of which 92% are microenterprises. Such a high number presents challenges in terms of the State&rsquo;s engagement with and support of enterprises in addition to ensuring compliance with the EU's state aid rules.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of expanding the eligible entities, the LEOs have already started on this route with last year&rsquo;s Productivity Fund which targeted an expanded cohort of enterprises (for employees up to 50) which would customarily not have qualified for funding as well as in the provision of Business Continuity Vouchers through the LEOs for small businesses with employment up to 50. Enterprise Ireland is also working with a broader base of non-exporting SMEs, such as through the Retail On-line Scheme and through its Covid 19 Sustaining Enterprise Fund. <\/p>  <p>  In that regard, legislative powers are available under Section 7 (1) (i) of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998 to require Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs to administer any schemes, grants and other financial facilities requiring the disbursement of European Union and such other funds as may from time to time be authorised by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  These powers have been used extensively in tackling the dual challenges of Brexit and Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  It is key that, whatever overarching institutional framework we have for developing micro businesses and SMEs, that a benign environment is in place for SMEs to start up, scale up, to access international markets and to enable SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital and green economy. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, I have established the SME Growth Taskforce in follow up to a commitment in the Programme for Government in order to design a National SME Growth Plan that will map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint for SMEs and entrepreneurs beyond COVID-19.  <\/p>  <p>  The Task Force will also examine the recommendations in the 2019 OECD Report including the strategic framework and current delivery system for SME supports and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.   This new Taskforce is composed of a broad range of business people with expertise in a range of sectors, as well as SME representative groups and other individuals uniquely positioned to contribute to a long-term vision for the SME sector and how best it can be supported.  I hope to receive recommendations from the task force in November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[29720\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"his plans for further measures to assist the business sectors negatively impacted by Covid-19, bearing in mind that the virus will remain a threat for some time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>I am acutely aware that until a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment is widely available, the necessary responses to protect public health will continue to impact economic activity.<\/p>  <p>  I would remind the Deputy that much has already been done to assist enterprises through the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland came through the initial economic shock with unparalleled levels of State intervention aimed at stabilising the economy and supporting businesses, employment and incomes.

It will support both those in employment and those whose jobs have not survived the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  With the Budget providing for an increase in core capital spending programmes of some &euro;1.6 billion in 2021, the Government will invest in job-rich infrastructure projects which are regionally distributed and on insulating the economy, as much as possible, from the fallout from Covid and Brexit.  We will use these measures to get as many people back to work as quickly as possible and to mitigate against any potential scarring from long-term unemployment.  <\/p>  <p>  The further extension of the EWSS until the end of December 2021 marks a historic intervention by Government to support employment in businesses affected by this pandemic. It ensures that the link between the employer and the employee is maintained and assists businesses to continue to trade in spite of reduced demand. We are also promoting the take-up of available employment by allowing self-employed PUP recipients to take up intermittent or occasional work opportunities without losing their PUP entitlement.  <\/p>  <p>  We are managing difficult trade-offs to allow the economy to operate as fully and effectively as possible to minimise permanent loss of economic activity while safely living with Covid-19.  I am aware that despite this approach, some businesses, particularly in the entertainment, arts and hospitality sectors remain badly impacted by restrictions.  The COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is being introduced to help businesses who are severely restricted to meet ongoing costs through periods of restriction and provide employment as restrictions are eased and activity resumes. <\/p>  <p>  Over the medium-term, our overarching expectation is that with the right set of policies we will be on the other side of this crisis and in recovery mode from 2022 onwards although high levels of unemployment are likely to take longer to address. The National Economic Plan, to be published in November, will look to the future setting the vision and roadmap to 2025 and the longer-term policy approaches to ensure that our economy will be resilient into the future.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Economic Plan will focus on ensuring a balanced recovery, building resilience across enterprise and sectors and future proofing the economy and society with a focus on the digital and green transformation of enterprise. SME productivity will be at the heart of the plan. At the same time, it will aim to maximise the potential of the FDI sector in Ireland and strengthen linkages between these sectors.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[29850\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"his plans to support businesses following the announcement of level 3 Covid-19 restrictions in view of the fact that additional measures of support are available for counties Donegal and Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>The Government made the decision that from midnight on the 6th of October, all remaining counties were to be placed on Level 3 for a period of 3 weeks until midnight on 27th October 2020, at which point we will again review the situation, based on the status of the virus and public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that these restrictions will have a significant impact on businesses and employment around the country.

My Department has worked intensively to shine a light of female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models with targeted events and awards, including Network Ireland&rsquo;s - Business Networking for Women Across Ireland and the Planet Woman Academy.<\/p><p>The recently established SME Taskforce will bring forward a national SME Growth Plan next month. The SME Growth Plan will set out a long-term strategic framework for SME and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland. This will be an opportunity to examine measures to increase the number of new entrepreneurs starting businesses, including women and other under-represented groups. I look forward to seeing the proposals that are brought forward in the Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[29987\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"his plans to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to make workplace outbreaks of Covid-19 notifiable by workers to the Health and Safety Authority.","asker":"1491","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[23678\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500042#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"if he will respond positively to calls from nurses and other healthcare professionals to reinsert the requirement that infectious diseases, including Covid-19, are reported by employers to the Health and Safety Authority as infectious diseases in the workplace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 71 together.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to introduce an SI in early November to bring in new Biological Agent regulations in line with the European Union Directive (EU) 2020\/739.

Under the agreement, the EU would eliminate tariffs on imports of U.S. live and frozen lobster products.  The EU tariffs would be eliminated for a period of five years and the European Commission would promptly initiate procedures aimed at making the tariff changes permanent.

On Friday 9 October last I co-Chaired the first meeting of the Government's new Hospitality and Tourism Forum with my ministerial colleague, Catherine Martin T.D. <\/p><p>On 28<sup>th<\/sup>August 2020, the Government announced a further &euro;16m support package to help pubs, bars and nightclubs, recognising the economic impact of Covid-19 on their businesses and to assist planning and adaptation for their re-opening. This package contained measures including:<\/p><p>- Restart Grant Plus 40% Top Up: Those businesses remaining closed and planning their re-opening can now receive a minimum of &euro;5,600 and a maximum of &euro;35,000 under the Restart Grant Plus. This can be used to help additional expense and adaptations associated with re-opening when the time comes. <\/p><p>- Waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020.<\/p><p>- Waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.<\/p><p>These measures have been implemented in addition to the existing Restart Grant Plus, Tourism Adaptation Fund, the wage subsidy scheme, commercial rates waiver, liquidity supports and tax measures (such as warehousing of tax debt and reduction in VAT).<\/p><p>The Restart Grant Plus provides direct grant aid to businesses with up to 250 employees to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. Top-ups were previously made available for eligible businesses in Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Dublin and Donegal in respect of a further period of restrictions, for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs nationwide that re-opened on 21 September, and for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs in Dublin that remain closed. <\/p><p>Businesses in Dublin and Donegal were generally eligible for a grant top-up due to the restrictions imposed at that time. Donegal pubs remained partially open, so the pubs were entitled to an additional top-up in recognition of the restrictions imposed. Meanwhile, Dublin pubs that were forced to remain closed were entitled to a further enhanced top-up.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, on 6<sup>th<\/sup>October 2020 all parts of the country moved to Level Three of the Government&rsquo;s Framework for Restrictive Measures for a period of three weeks. <\/p><p>I understand that these restrictions have a significant impact on businesses and employment around the country. In recognition of the impact of these restrictions on businesses, a 30% top-up to the Restart Plus grant is being provided to help support those affected through the three-week period. In addition, in recognising that Level 3 has been extended in Dublin and Donegal beyond the three-week period, businesses in these counties are eligible for a further top-up in addition to those made available in September. Businesses in the hospitality sector and other vulnerable sectors who have previously benefited from the Restart Grant are eligible to re-apply for this top-up. <\/p><p>These supports are supplementary to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other Government initiatives.<\/p><p>In addition to the measures announced in Budget 2021, the Deputy will recall that on 23 July last we announced the July Stimulus Package, a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy worth more than &euro;5 billion, with an additional &euro;2 billion in loan guarantees which is bigger in scale than most budgets and is being deployed at speed. The July Stimulus package was designed to help businesses to open, to help those already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, there are new opportunities. <\/p><p>The range of measures in place to assist businesses include direct grants to support viable businesses and jobs, including new hire. We have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which will run until the end of March 2021 and will be open to firms that do not currently participate and open to workers like seasonal workers who were not previously included. We we are giving companies extra assistance through an enhanced Restart Plus grant and reductions in the rate of VAT.  From 1<sup>st<\/sup>September, the six-month reduction in the VAT came into effect, going down from 23% to 21%. <\/p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. I announced the reopening of MFI lending on 31<sup>st<\/sup>August and I launched the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme on 7<sup>th<\/sup>September.  <\/p><p>Budget 2021, together with the measures we announced as part of the July Stimulus Package, provides a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy and to help businesses to open, to help those already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, there are new opportunities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500043#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500043#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[30137\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500043#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the supports in place to help businesses that have no income to alleviate the pressures of commercial rents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>I understand this is a difficult time for many businesses, especially those heavily impacted by the crisis who are facing an uncertain future.

Throughout this crisis, the Government has been encouraging commercial tenants and landlords to engage with each other and have asked landlords to show forbearance in these extraordinary times. Ultimately, it is in the best interest of both parties to come to a reasonable arrangement.<\/p><p>Ireland came through the initial economic shock with unparalleled levels of State intervention aimed at stabilising the economy and supporting businesses, employment and incomes.

It is based on an approach taken in other jurisdictions, including Australia, France and the UK.<\/p><p>The Code sets out how both parties can work together to get through these uncertain times.

However, a deal cannot come at any cost and we cannot undermine the EU&rsquo;s economic interests or the integrity of the Single Market.<\/p><p>Brexit, in whatever shape it finally takes, will have a significant impact on the Irish economy fundamentally changing the trading environment for businesses trading with the UK excluding Northern Ireland. Whatever the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union at the end of the transition period.  With just over two months until this economic Brexit, work to ensure Government, business and citizens are getting Brexit ready is of paramount importance, because change will happen from 1 January 2021.<\/p><p>Government has over the last number of budgets taken extensive action to mitigate the worst effects of Brexit. <\/p><p>A range of initiatives are available from Government to assist with getting Brexit ready. These range from planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets, and innovation supports. These are all provided through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. <\/p><p>Financial supports are available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland such as the Brexit Loan Scheme which offers businesses the means to deal with short term liquidity issues that could arise for instance in buying stocks or for delays that could arise at the ports. <\/p><p>Businesses also need longer term funding for investment purposes, and the SBCI Future Growth Loan Scheme, which was expanded at the beginning of the Summer in response to very high demand, provides up to &euro;800m in lending to eligible businesses to support strategic long-term investment, including for a post-Brexit\/post-Covid-19 environment. <\/p><p>The new &euro;2 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme, which Government launched in mid-September, is the largest guarantee scheme that has ever been provided for Irish businesses to date to ensure there is financing available for Irish businesses as they reboot and rebuild both through Covid-19 and Brexit.<\/p><p>We have also provided further funding to MFI to ensure it can meet the needs of microenterprises that can not avail of bank funding over the coming period.  <\/p><p>Budget 2021 is no different and has been developed on a worst case scenario based of a No Deal Brexit. In this Budget, Government announced a contingency fund of &euro;100 million that will be available to assist businesses to deal with Brexit.<\/p><p>Customs is an area that will most immediately impact businesses on 1 January next and we have been actively working to put in place grants and customs training programmes.As part of the July jobs stimulus, Government rolled out a &euro;20 million Ready for Customs package to help businesses involved in exporting and importing with the UK to put in place the necessary internal arrangements, staffing, software, and IT systems to be ready for the new customs arrangements and regulatory requirements that will apply from 1 January 2021. <\/p><p>As part of this package, Enterprise Ireland launched a new &ldquo;Ready for Customs&rdquo; grant through which businesses can claim grants of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee hired, or redeployed within the business, to a dedicated customs role. A second phase of Skillnet Ireland&rsquo;s free customs training, Clear Customs Online 2020, is open for applications since 9 September, to support the customs intermediary sector and businesses that trade frequently with, or through, the UK. Since 9 September, over 1,000 businesses have registered for Clear Customs Online 2020.  <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland also run an on-line Customs Insights course which is helping businesses to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to move goods from, to and through the UK. The Local Enterprise Offices are also carrying out the second phase of their one-to-one successful Brexit mentoring and training &ldquo;Prepare Your Business for Customs&rdquo; workshops.  These workshops have commenced and are supported by a full awareness campaign to target small Irish businesses.  <\/p><p>In early September, Government published a Brexit Readiness Action Plan. This Plan provides guidance and advice to business and individuals in a vast range of areas including trade in goods and services, customs and other sanitary and phytosanitary checks and controls, import duties, EU single market accreditations, use of the UK landbridge, data transfer, recognition of qualifications, and many other issues. The Plan provides clear advice on steps that need to be taken by businesses to address these many and varied issues come 1 January 2021.<\/p><p>Last week I wrote to all businesses that are registered in the State which amounts to over 225,000 businesses to inform them of key actions that they need to take in advance of 1 January and to provide them with a useful Brexit Checklist of those key actions.<b><\/b>The Revenue Commissioners have also written to over 90,000 businesses that have traded with the UK since 2019 to advise them of essential customs changes that lie ahead. This letter also included relevant information from the Department of Agriculture on exporting animals, plants and products of animal and plant origin.  Revenue is proactively following up by way of telephone calls with the businesses to work to get the messages across.<\/p><p>My Department, through the regulatory agencies under my remit, also has ongoing engagement in important regulatory areas such as product certification and standardisation, market surveillance and on consumer and competition issues.  Agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) are currently hosting webinars to inform businesses of the important steps they need to take to be Brexit ready from a regulatory perspective. <\/p><p>The Department of Transport has been engaging extensively with the shipping sector to assess the capacity available on direct routes to continental ports.  The sector has indicated that sufficient capacity is available on direct routes and that the sector is capable of responding to any further increase in demand. Now is the time for engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align their transit demands with shipping capacity. I would also encourage traders to proactively consider switching to direct ferry route options to the continent wherever feasible to avoid where possible transiting through the UK Landbridge.<\/p><p>Preparing for the change that Brexit will bring from the start of next year is a key priority across Government. This work has intensified and will continue in the period ahead. We remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure that businesses and citizens are as ready as they can be for the end of transition.<\/p><p>In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s top 10 trading partners (for exports and imports of goods &amp;amp; services) these are: the US, UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, China, Switzerland, Italy and Japan.  While the UK is, and will remain, a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a key priority.  In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified with a commitment to assist and support clients to enter new markets and expand in their current markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500043#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":209,"content":"<p>Question No. 80 answered with Question No. 41.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":210,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 79.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500043#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[30874\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500043#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment","minister":"Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment","question":"the extent to which his Department expects to combat the negative aspects of Covid-19 in the year ahead with particular reference to maintaining the highest possible levels of activity in the areas of trade, enterprise and employment; the extent to which he expects to achieve success in respect of each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>The pandemic has caused untold damage to people's lives and livelihoods.

Small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators have been badly affected due to their dependence on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Limousine operators, who are particularly dependent on overseas tourism and major events, have suffered a near total drop in demand for their services and many have been simply unable to work since the pandemic started in March.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports for affected businesses.  These supports include wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports. Many SPSV operators, including limousine drivers, have been able to avail of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which will remain open to new applicants for the remainder of the year. This is an important lifeline for SPSV operators. Many may have gone back to work as the economy began to reopen only to find that subsequent necessary public health measures have once again suppressed passenger demand for their services. The continued accessibility of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will provide an important safety net to operators, recognising their dependency on other sectors of the economy, notably the hospitality industry<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA), the industry regulator,  also took a number of actions to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change. These included licence extensions and late renewal fee waivers. It has also engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. I remain committed to helping reduce the costs to limousine operators and that is why my Department is providing the necessary funding to the NTA to enable it to waive annual vehicle licence renewal fees for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The 2021 Budget has now put in place a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the  tourism sector. These are sector-specific measures, and are augmented and supplemented by the economy-wide business supports and social welfare measures which were already in place as well as those which were announced in the budget. The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by over &euro;59 million or 36% over the initial 2020 allocation in Budget 2020 to &euro;220.9 million. Further details on these measures are available from my colleague, the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport  and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin T.D.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I should also mention that, in recognition of the nexus between limousine operators and the tourism industry, in July it was arranged to have the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles appointed to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Industry Advisory Group to ensure that the interests of these operators are appropriately represented as the Government plans the recovery of the tourism and hospitality sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[30868\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a driver test will be expedited for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p> I fully appreciate the difficulty that many learner drivers are experiencing since the driving test for cars, vans and minibuses resumed on a gradual basis from 16 July last.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   <\/p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;<\/p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; <\/p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  <\/p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. My officials are currently examining the judgement, in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, and will bring forward any policy and\/or legislative proposals, as necessary, for my consideration in due course.  <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. <\/p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I anticipate that the work that is currently ongoing in relation to this matter will provide a proper basis for me to make a decision on the best pathway forward and to address the current legal uncertainty surrounding the Scheme. I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH02093","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Remote Working","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH02100"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[30802\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a request made by an association (details supplied) that employers would provide the &euro;3.20 per day to cover the additional costs of working from home such as heat, light and electricity, which is the same level of payment as the tax-free allowance the Revenue Commissioners provide; if he will consider same in view of the huge number of persons working from home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>The <i>2020 Programme for Government: Our Shared Future<\/i>contains several commitments related to working from home, including an examination of the &ldquo;<i>feasibility and merits of changing tax arrangements to encourage more people to work remotely<\/i>&rdquo;, the responsibility for which falls to my Department.  There is also a commitment to the development of a &rdquo;<i>national remote working strategy<\/i>&rdquo; and to that end, a Remote Working Strategy Inter-Departmental Group has been established.  Officials from my Department are included in this group which is chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  A number of issues are being considered as relevant to these commitments, the results of which will be made public in due course.<\/p><p>In terms of the current tax treatment of the costs associated with working from home, I would note that any such costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business by an employer (for example, the provision of equipment) may be deducted by the employer in the normal course of calculating the tax liability of their business.<\/p><p>From the perspective of the individual employee, there is no specific tax credit available to employees where they work from home.  The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons including the nature of their work and also the nature of their home environment.  <\/p><p>However, I am advised by Revenue that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC. Where employers avail of this facility, they are not required to advise Revenue and therefore the number of employees reimbursed in this manner is not available. Where employers choose to pay more than &euro;3.20, the excess is subject to deduction of PAYE, PRSI and USC.<\/p><p>Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.<\/p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.<\/p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. <\/p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home. <\/p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies. <\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance, such as mortgage protection cover and what terms to apply.  These factors can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the mortgage repayment schedule.  In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms prior claims experience. <\/p>  <p>  In order to assist with the Deputy's specific query, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers in Ireland. It stated that while most customers are still be able to get life; critical illness; or mortgage protection insurance at this challenging time it is aware of a small number of individual cases where a final decision on some life insurance applications is being postponed for a period of time where applicants have an underlying health condition.  However, it stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, such as Type 1 diabetes, will be taken into account by the underwriters, as was the case pre-Covid.  Insurance Ireland further noted that it understands that mortgage protection is not a universal requirement for mortgage approval by banks who in practice apply the following exceptions to holding life cover when an applicant applies for a mortgage:<\/p>  <p>  - The applicant already has sufficient life cover.<\/p>  <p>  - The applicant is over age 50.<\/p>  <p>  - The mortgage is not on the applicant&rsquo;s principal private residence.<\/p>  <p>  - The applicant cannot get insurance, or only at a much higher rate than normal.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Deputy will be aware that both I and Minister of State Fleming have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19 that we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[30787\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500046#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if in his engagement with the banks regarding payment breaks, the issue of borrows repaying interest only was raised; his views on the merit to the proposition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":332,"content":"<p>On 18 March last, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) announced a coordinated approach by banks and other lenders to help their customers who were economically impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.  The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. This was a welcome initiative and it allowed important and necessary cash flow relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.  However, the other aspects of a loan agreement, including the issue of interest accrual during the period of the payment break, remained a commercial matter for the parties to a loan agreement.<\/p><p>Banks have now provided for flexible options for borrowers who can recommence payments following a Covid-19 payment break, and the BPFI has produced a useful guide on this - .  The Central Bank has also updated its Covid-19 FAQ in relation to mortgage payment breaks on 18 September. <\/p><p>However, I am very conscious that many other borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and that they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends.

It was also indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers still experiencing mortgage or other loan difficulty because of Covid-19.  These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.

Specifically, Provision 3.12 of the Code requires that credit institutions must i) notify the Central Bank immediately; ii) provide at least two months&rsquo; notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements; iii) ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to the closure, merger or move; or alternatively, inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided; and iv) notify the wider community of the closure, merger or move in the local press in advance. <\/p>  <p>  Provision 3.12 does not preclude credit institutions from providing longer notice periods than the aforementioned 2 months&rsquo; notice when closing, moving or merging a branch.

Single adults represent over 75% of the total number of households accessing homelessness services and in recognition of this fact I launched a &lsquo;Call for Housing 2020&rsquo; in July, with a particular focus on sourcing one bed properties. <\/p>  <p>  I have also allocated &euro;40 million for the refurbishment of 2,500 vacant properties which will be completed and allocated to people on the social housing list this year. The Programme for Government recognises the importance of ensuring an appropriate mix of housing design types and aims to continue to expand the Housing First approach with a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes and the provision of relevant supporting services.<\/p>  <p>  Preventing people from entering homelessness in the first instance is a top priority for my Department and that is why at the end of July I brought forward the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020. The Act came into effect on August 1st and protects tenants experiencing rent arrears from eviction\/rent increases prior to 11th January 2021, and applies nationwide subject to the tenant making an appropriate declaration. The Programme for Government commits to improving security and affordability for all renters. To achieve this, the Government is developing a Cost Rental model and programme for delivery of housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for construction and management of homes.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin, where homelessness is most pronounced, we know that from the start of 2020, 59% of families presenting to homeless services were prevented from having to enter emergency accommodation by way of a tenancy having been created. Indeed, during the second quarter of 2020 alone, two out of every three families who presented to homeless services were prevented from having to enter emergency accommodation in Dublin. It is due to progress such as this that we have seen the number of families accessing emergency accommodation nationally fall to its lowest number since June 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place finder service is an important aid for homeless households or households who are in danger of falling into homelessness, and who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. The Place Finder service has proven to be very effective, with HAP responsible for approximately 65% of the exits from homelessness recorded in 2019.  More than 11,500 tenancies entered the HAP scheme on foot of a referral from a local authority Homeless Unit by end Q1 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Other important homelessness prevention services include the national Tenancy Protection Service which is provided by Threshold with funding from my Department.  This service links tenants at risk of losing their homes to Local Authorities and with Social Protection services in order for them to access supports before becoming homeless, enabling them to continue in their existing tenancies.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the Residential Tenancies Board in ensuring that vulnerable households in the private rented sector are fully aware of their rights and where tenancies are terminated resulting in households becoming homeless.<\/p>  <p>  I have also established a High Level Homelessness Taskforce and I am also in regular contact with my colleague the Minister for Health, as I believe a strong collaboration between both Departments will help those with complex health and mental health needs successfully exit homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021, which was announced on 13 October, makes provision for &euro;218m in funding for homeless services.  This is an increase of &euro;22m on 2020 (&euro;196m) or an increase of 11%.  This additional funding in 2021 reflects the priority that I as Minister, and the Government, is giving to homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500048#WRK02887","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500048#WRK02900"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[30848\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500048#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the date on which funding will be made available to a county council (details supplied) that applied for funding to deal with wastewater treatment plants in housing estates to allow it to take these estates in charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":416,"content":"<p>On 21 September, I announced allocations under the new multi-annual capital investment programme for the progressive resolution of housing estates with &ldquo;developer provided water services infrastructure&rdquo;, to enable the taking in charge of these estates.

This is of particular concern when those structures confiscated or demolished are donor-funded. The only possible conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these policies, especially in areas where illegal Israeli settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land. <\/p><p>Ireland joined the European Commission-led West Bank Protection Consortium in 2017 at my instigation, during my first visit to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Consortium plays a leading role in supporting threatened communities and coordinating the provision of essential services to them, including material assistance and legal aid. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Consortium underlines our commitment to reducing the vulnerability of Palestinian communities living in Area C of the West Bank.<\/p><p>My primary concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families. But it is right that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should also be pursued. Ireland is part of a group of EU Member States which pursue this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium.  It is the practice of the Consortium to raise this directly with the Israeli authorities and to date, Consortium have sought compensation of over &euro;625,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets.<\/p><p>Demolitions and seizures of Palestinian property and humanitarian aid, including Palestinian homes, continue, despite previous commitments from Israeli authorities not to target Palestinian residential structures during the Covid-19 pandemic. The monthly average for 2020 shows an acceleration in demolitions, the September situation report of the West Bank Protection Consortium notes an average of 31 demolitions per month, higher than the average of 28 in 2016 which was previously the high-water mark. <\/p><p>With regard to the specific case the Deputy mentions, Irish officials are aware of this and have been following it closely. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Tel Aviv has raised this case with the Israeli authorities, along with a group of EU and non-EU colleagues. Ireland regularly conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU. I have done so myself on my visits to the region. <\/p><p>  The practice of demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under International Law, including provisions of international humanitarian law, and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention. These practices also cause suffering to ordinary Palestinians, and impinge on the right of children to an education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500048#WRK03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Election Monitoring Missions","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500048#WRK04000"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[30840\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500048#WRK04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of members on the election observation roster; the steps taken to establish the number of roster members able and willing to volunteer for overseas election observation missions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic; if he will make temporary additions to the roster by the appointment of experienced observers in order to ensure Ireland is in a position to make a meaningful contribution to international election observation missions as they arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>The current roster of volunteers available for nomination to election observation missions organised by the EU and OSCE has 199 members, as listed in the response to Parliamentary Questions No. 338 and No. 342 of 21 July 2020.

The roster, which is facilitated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is effective as of 1 January 2019 and is set to run through 2023.

Election observation missions pose particular challenges in the context of COVID-19, given extensive travel within the destination country and close contact with residents as well as election observers from other countries.

In the meantime, pending its report and decisions taken on its recommendations, the Government has clearly stated that the State Pension Age will remain at 66 years.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500052#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Administration","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500052#WRO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[30668\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500052#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the policy regarding welfare payments for persons with no fixed abode; if claimants are permitted to use An Post&rsquo;s address point as an address; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>My Department is aware of the Address Point service offered by An Post, which provides a free personal address and mail collection service for persons with no fixed abode.  <\/p><p>In relation to welfare payments, the An Post Address Point service can be used as a method of postal contact for a customer, but not as proof of address. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500052#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500052#WRO02000"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[30690\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500052#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the criteria for invalidity pension payments will be examined; and if the introduction of a measure that will allow recipients of invalidity pension to work up to ten hours per week while in receipt of the full payment will be examined (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness. To qualify for an award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical conditions.  <\/p><p>Where a person in receipt of Invalidity Pension  wishes to return to work, they may apply for Partial Capacity Benefit.  The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme extends the welfare system by explicitly recognising and responding to the reality that some people with disabilities will have a capacity to engage in open market employment while continuing to receive some income support from the State.  The objective of the scheme is to support such people to return to the workplace without fear of loss of their disability-related social welfare benefits.<\/p><p>If awarded, Partial Capacity Benefit will allow them to continue to receive, in addition to their earnings from employment, a percentage of their illness benefit or invalidity pension payment while working.  After the medical assessment, if a person's disability is rated as moderate, severe or profound their previous payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% per cent, respectively.<\/p><p>Since 13 February 2012, Partial Capacity Benefit replaced the previous arrangements where people on Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension could get permission to work part-time (known as an &quot;exemption&quot;) for rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes and keep their full social welfare payment.  In this context it is important to note however, in relation to Partial Capacity Benefit that:<\/p><p>-  there is no requirement that a person must undertake work that is of a &lsquo;rehabilitative or therapeutic&rsquo; nature (and therefore the question of an exemption no longer applies); <\/p><p>-  Partial Capacity Benefit is voluntary;<\/p><p>-  Partial Capacity Benefit allows people to continue to receive a percentage of their Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment while working; <\/p><p>-  there is no restriction on the number of hours worked; <\/p><p>-  there is no restriction on earnings;<\/p><p>-  a person who participates on the Partial Capacity Benefit scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment if, for example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot continue to work.<\/p><p>-  a person on Partial Capacity Benefit, with an underlying entitlement to Invalidity Pension, will retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years that is for five years while in employment. <\/p><p>The medical conditionality for Disability Allowance is that the person is substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of that person&rsquo;s age, experience and qualifications.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the fuel allowance payment a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including being in receipt of a qualifying payment.

There is no official data on the extent of staff shortages. However, officials in my Department have been actively monitoring the issue and have sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives on the Covid Advisory Group on Reopening, which has been meeting regularly over recent months. In Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report (mid-2019 data), the staff turnover rate stood at 23%. In County Meath the staff turnover rate was 21%. The figure remains unsustainably high.<\/p><p>I am committed to supporting providers in responding to current challenges. For example, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is available to the early learning and childcare sector, with a full exemption to the turnover rule, to assist them with staffing costs. Specifically in relation to recruitment difficulties, it is important that any measures considered are proportionate to the problem they seek to address and that wider impacts would be carefully considered. <\/p><p>Staffing and recruitment difficulties are being caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of turnover and attrition. This is predominantly down to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.55 per hour, and half of staff only being able to access part-time contracts. It is expected that poor terms and conditions will be addressed in the medium to long term via three plans currently being pursued by Government: a new funding model, a workforce development plan, and additional investment. Short-term measures are more challenging to find and, as stated above, the Department continues to work intensively with sectoral representatives to examine what might be possible. One potential solution that has been proposed by the sector is being given active attention at the moment by the Department of Education and Skills and my Department. <\/p><p>In that regard, it is important to stress that the minimum qualification requirement to work directly with children in an early learning and care service (Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications) was introduced in 2016 in order to improve the quality of provision and to achieve better outcomes for children. (There is currently no minimum qualification requirement for staff working in school-age childcare.) To remove this minimum qualification requirement could be contrary to the best interests of children and the vision for the sector that is outlined in <i>First 5<\/i>, the whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families. Such a move could be a significant backwards step in efforts to improve quality outcomes for children and could only be considered if there were a very strong evidence base requiring a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500053#WRP02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges Provision","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500053#WRP02700"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[30864\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500053#WRP02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 792 of 8 September 2020, the reason his answer included the standard of one family place per 10,000 women when this is not the standard used in the Istanbul Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV). <\/p>  <p>  The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (known as the Istanbul Convention) sets out signatory obligations.

Further details will be available for student shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 will provide further funding to provide enhanced SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increased support for the PATH access initiative to increase participation in Higher Education from the most economically disadvantaged students.<\/p>  <p>  This builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including the provision of additional student assistance including a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education to assist with difficulties in accessing technology to facilitate their course work in a blended capacity.  These supports are being distributed through the colleges and further education providers. <\/p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund, which was doubled this year to &euro;16 million. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the challenges faced by students in relation to student accommodation this year due to financial pressures and the blended learning format of the 2020\/21 academic year. Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.<\/p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.<\/p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). <\/p>  <p>  I have asked our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year, as well as flexibility with regard to cancellations and refunds. I would hope that private providers will show the same flexibility, however it is not within my remit to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500053#WRP04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Aid","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500053#WRP04200"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[30899\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500053#WRP04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the value of regional aid granted under the regional aid guidelines granted by his Department or agencies under the remit of his Department in each of the past seven years; the value by county or lowest possible NUTS level over the period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>The EU Regional Aid Guidelines (RAGS) provides for enhanced rates of State Aid in the least economically developed areas of each Member State.

I am further informed that a provision is to be included in the Merchant Shipping (International Conventions) Bill currently being prepared by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which will enable Ireland to ratify and implement the ILO Work in Fishing Convention.   <\/p>  <p>  I understand that secondary legislation is also required in order to facilitate compliance with obligations under the Convention. Furthermore, I also understand that work is at an advanced stage in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the transposition of EU Directive 2017\/159 which will implement the standards of the Convention. The Directive aims to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working on vessels registered in an EU Member State.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015, following the publication of claims of possible exploitation of undocumented migrant workers on Irish fishing trawlers in the Guardian newspaper, an interdepartmental Task Force on Non-EEA Workers in the Irish Fishing Industry was established by the Government to examine the specific issues identified in the newspaper report and to make recommendations on appropriate actions. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Government Task Force recommended the establishment of a sector-specific Atypical Worker Permission system that would provide a structured and transparent framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish commercial sea-fishing fleet.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme provided for the first time a framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet. The Scheme sets down minimum terms and conditions of employment applicable to non-EEA fishers which are in line with the general statutory terms and conditions applicable to workers more generally in the State. The Scheme was welcomed as a solution to the risk of exploitation and to guarantee employment rights and protections to non-EEA fishers availing of the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  This new AWS scheme was not a regularisation of undocumented workers but rather putting in place for the first time a regulatory regime for the employment of non-EEA workers in this sector of the fishing industry. Once introduced, those employers and employees in the fishing industry that remained outside of the scheme would be in breach of immigration and employment law.<\/p>  <p>  The Atypical Working Scheme is administered by the Immigration Service of my Department and its role is limited to providing the immigration elements of the overall solution.  Various State bodies with oversight of the sector have roles in the industry in respect of how the industry should operate in respect of employment, health and safety and working conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Applications to the scheme, prepared by a solicitor practising in the State on behalf of the employer, are submitted in the first instance to the Central Depository administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in order to ensure that the contract meets the criteria of the scheme. Thereafter an application is made to Immigration Service for an immigration permission. The Scheme requires that the crew member be provided a copy of their contract of employment in both English and in their native language.<\/p>  <p>  The AWS scheme is monitored by an Oversight Committee chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Any abuses or otherwise of the employment conditions in the Irish fishing industry is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission, the Marine Survey Office, and other appropriate authorities of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Where an individual believes themselves to be a victim of human trafficking or where another person believes that this situation applies, they should contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS), or an NGO or State authority (e.g. WRC) who will be able to refer their case to AGS. AGS will be in a position to take the victim to a place of safety and arrange for immediate accommodation, food and medical needs.<\/p>  <p>  AGS will refer the person&rsquo;s case to the competent authority for the identification of victims, the Human Trafficking investigation and Coordination Unit (HTICU) of AGS. Where an individual is identified as a suspected victim of human trafficking by HTICU they will be eligible to receive State supports and services, including immigration permission, through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to assist their recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500054#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[30723\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500054#WRQ02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made to improve access to supports for victims of human trafficking; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>The Government is fully committed to addressing human trafficking in all forms, including through the provision of supports for victims of human trafficking and by educating the public to recognise the signs of trafficking and be aware that victims of trafficking can be found anywhere and can be hidden in plain sight. <\/p>  <p>  Addressing human trafficking in a holistic manner requires the engagement of various stakeholders and a number of key actions undertaken recently or due to be completed soon in the near future, including - <\/p>  <p>-  The designation of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) as Ireland&rsquo;s independent National Rapporteur for Anti-Human Trafficking under article 19 of the EU Human Trafficking Directive. <\/p>  <p>-  The commencement of a review of the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which criminalised the purchase of sex as part of a wider approach to protection of persons trafficked into prostitution, <\/p>  <p>-  Engagement by the Department of Justice and Equality with NGOs to identify solutions to the provision of accommodation to victims of trafficking, particularly female victims of sexual exploitation, and in respect of which a further announcement will be made by my colleague the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth;<\/p>  <p>-  The establishment of a forum for victims and stakeholders in relation to human trafficking, which has met twice to date, and which will examine the need to update the existing National Action Plan on Human Trafficking, including to respond to the commitment in the Programme for Government to adopt and implement a comprehensive strategy to combat trafficking of women and girls; <\/p>  <p>-  working with the Forum in a review of the National Referral Mechanism in Ireland, learning from best practice models in other EU Member States; <\/p>  <p>-  Drafting legislation to strengthen the penal framework on people smuggling, thereby implementing three international legal instruments in the area and;<\/p>  <p>-  The recent launch of a joint multimedia campaign between the Department of Justice and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to raise public awareness about Human Trafficking.

In 2019 the Board reviewed 360 counsel fee claims and found that in the majority of cases claims were processed promptly, many within 2-3 days of receipt. It can happen, due to a variety of circumstances, including incomplete claims, that certain claims can take longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500054#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2021","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500054#WRQ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[30863\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020101500054#WRQ03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on investing &euro;1.5 million in an assistive technology passport in budget 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>The issue raised by the Deputy now falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration.

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.<\/p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. <\/p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are at Level 3 of the Plan for living with Covid-19 until 28th October.

I also expect dentists to continue to honour their ethical and contractual obligations to patients during the notice withdrawal period, to either provide a service or to ensure that patients are referred to another dentist who will provide a service.
