I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to the House.  The Minister of State was always very strong on educational matters.  The matter I raise this morning relates to St. Teresa's Special School in Ballinasloe, County Galway.  Last November we were very proud that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and others came to Ballinasloe and gave the go-ahead for a new school for St. Teresa's.  St. Teresa's has been based at the enterprise centre in Ballinasloe on Creagh Road for a number of years.  It is very cramped.  It is very hard for them to do their daily work.  <\/p> <p>It is a special school with 36 enrolled, all of whom have special needs.  Indeed, in September 2022 another class will be added to the school.  It was a great day and a great announcement.  This morning I want to find out from the Minister of State and the Department where it stands.

I compliment Anita O'Reilly, who is the principal.  She does Trojan work, as do all the staff.  They are committed to the students.  They give more than their daily hours to the job to ensure all of the students and their parents and families are looked after.  The announcement of the new school was unbelievable news for them.  I am sure the Minister of State has an update for me.  I hope he has some good news on the project because it is very important that it moves ahead as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#A00700","speaker":"1674","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the schoolchildren in the Gallery, who are accompanied by our colleague, Senator O'Loughlin, who is the leader of the Council of Europe delegation from Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#B00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murphy for raising this matter and for his ongoing strong representation and lobbying for St. Teresa's Special School.  I will outline to the Seanad the current position on this major building project.  It is included in the Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment up to 2025.  This will allow the Department to move ahead with projects such as St. Teresa's Special School.  This investment will build on the good progress being made throughout the country to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  The investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.<\/p> <p>The Senator is aware of the extensive site identification and assessment exercise, as he was in constant contact with the Minister during that time.  This was to identify a permanent site location for St. Teresa's Special School.  The Minister can confirm that agreement in principle has been reached with the vendor on a 4 acre site at Parkmore, Creagh, Ballinasloe, for the provision of the permanent accommodation for the school and the legal work is at an advanced stage.  The major building project for St. Teresa's Special School will be delivered under the Department's accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme.  The ADAPT programme uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project.<\/p> <p>The tender process to appoint a project manager has just been completed.  The first step to be undertaken by the project manager will be the tender competitions for the appointment of design teams for a number of school building projects.  This will include the appointment of the design team for the St. Teresa's Special School project.  The Department will shortly be in touch with the school authorities about further developments on these appointments.  Upon appointment, the design team will proceed to stage one of the architectural planning, which is preliminary design, and in which the design team will assess the site and prepare initial sketch schemes.  The brief for this project is the construction of a new eight-classroom special school with significant associated ancillary accommodation on a greenfield site.  The school has an enrolment of 36 pupils and a staffing of principal plus six special classes.  The Department also approved additional interim accommodation of two temporary classrooms for the school in 2021 to cater for immediate needs.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Murphy.  I know from sitting in parliamentary party meetings and speaking to the Minister, Deputy Foley, he has been incessant in speaking about this project and the need for it.

As a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State I am very proud that it was put in our Constitution in very dark days in the late 1930s.  There is a constitutional right to primary education.  Everything we do, particularly with regard to primary education, needs to be with this constitutional right in mind.  It is a very important constitutional right.  It is the only socioeconomic right that is clear-cut and specifically written into the Constitution.  Everything we do should be focused on it.  The success of the State, and the State has been remarkably economically and socially successful since independence, has been down to our focus on education.  Of course it is an ancient Irish trait.  We have always been focused on education and learning.  We have really put it into practice since independence.  This constitutional right and this success must be spread to every child, including the children in Ballinasloe about whom Senator Murphy has spoken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#B00500","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","time":1653557400,"counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#B00550"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his time today.  Over many years many people in housing estates throughout the county have raised this and it does not seem to be unique to County Clare.  We have private housing estates built by developers and construction companies that went bust.  The housing estates have been left to their own devices.  In particular I want to ask what is being done for housing estates such as Westcoast View, Annagh, County Clare.  The people there have been waiting many years for the estate to be taken in charge.  At this stage they have been waiting nine years.  It has its own wastewater treatment plant and the position of Irish Water is that it is not responsible for taking in charge of developer-provided water services infrastructure.  Clare County Council can no longer legally take a private wastewater treatment plant, WWTP, in charge as it is no longer a water services authority.  How will we remedy this situation?  From doing lots of research and from many emails over and back it seems a number of estates in west Clare are in the same predicament, as they also have their own wastewater treatment plants.  They seem to be falling between two stools.  There is a disconnect in the legislation and private developments with developer-provided wastewater infrastructure cannot be taken in charge unless the legislation is changed to fund or legislate or both for Irish Water or local authorities to take the infrastructure in charge.<\/p> <p>There are more layers to this with the bond companies.  There seems to be a bond for estates when they are abandoned by a developer or construction company.  Often it takes years for the bond to be released to the local authority to use the money to do the work.  Often the bond is a fraction of the costs needed.  We have to wait years to get the bond for the local authorities to have the money to do the work and when they finally get it, perhaps eight or ten years later, it is a fraction of the costs needed.  This is very frustrating for me and I am the least of those involved.  There are the people living in the estates and the local authorities themselves.  The county council would like to be doing what it needs to do for these houses but it is not its responsibility and nor is it the responsibility of Irish Water.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> It remains to be seen how the taking-in-charge issue will be resolved.  As there are other counties with similar to ourselves so maybe this issue will be addressed.  The matter needs to be addressed nationally.  What will be done?  It seems we are in limbo because we have changed the powers of local authorities and given the powers they had to Irish Water, but nobody takes responsibility for these housing estates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#B00600","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a ard&uacute;.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue and providing me with the opportunity to address it, on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Unfortunately, he cannot be here to address the issue.<\/p> <p>Local authorities, as planning authorities, lead the taking in charge process of housing estates.  The taking in charge of housing estates by local authorities is provided for by the Planning and Development Act.<\/p> <p>A small subset of estates nationally that are not taken in charge rely on developer provided water services infrastructure for their water services.  This mainly consists of wastewater treatment facilities but a small number provide drinking water services for the estate.  This infrastructure was generally provided by the developer of the estate and is not connected to the public water services network.  They are privately owned facilities.<\/p> <p>In 2019, the Department introduced the multi-annual developer provided water services  infrastructure resolution programme to provide funding for the progressive resolution of these housing estates with these legacy issues.  The focus of the first multi-annual programme is on estates in towns and villages where the resolution is to connect their water services to the local Irish Water network.  This will enable Irish Water to take responsibility for the ongoing operation and management of the water service in the estate once the estate is taken in charge by the planning authority.<\/p> <p>In September 2020, the Minister announced allocations of just over &euro;3.36 million for 26 estates across ten counties with almost 950 households to benefit, under the new multi-annual programme, to enable the taking in charge of these estates.  A study is being carried out by Irish Water to develop the best solutions for estates with legacy developer provided water services infrastructure.  The study will help the Department with developing policy solutions, including issues around funding, for estates, such as the one referenced by the Senator, that due to distance and size are not viable to connect to the public network.  This is by considering sustainable treatment technologies either on the same site or another suitable alternative site.  I understand the study is expected to be completed by the summer.<\/p> <p>It will take a number of funding programmes to fully resolve these estates.  The Department is committed to progressing the taking in charge of these legacy estates through increased funding over the coming years.<\/p> <p>The Department is supporting the progressive taking in charge of estates with developer provided wastewater infrastructure.

I know that the Minister has been handed a legacy issue, but the water situation, between lead pipes, poor infrastructure and more, is appalling.  Apart from being told that a study might be completed by the summer, which could mean June or September, I have nothing to tell the residents of the estate.  I do not know how we can expedite the matter.  There is a housing crisis, but at least let the people who live in houses currently have decent water and access to water.  It is a basic human right to have access to clean water.  People ring me all of the time and they are extremely stressed because their water supply has been cut off.  The water situation is especially stressful for people who are at home so people with disabilities or people who work from home full-time or older people.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister the fact that I know he has to spend money on everything.

While the focus of this matter is capital allocations and progress with the Project Ireland 2040 plan, I must acknowledge that day-to-day operations and staff numbers have never recovered since the years of austerity.  Such a situation remains a challenge for many of the national cultural institutions whose staff numbers compare very unfavourably with their counterparts in Scotland, Wales and England.<\/p> <p>Under Project 2040, a sum of &euro;460 million has been set aside for national cultural institutions.

The refurbishment of the National Gallery has led the way.  It is a beautiful redevelopment and shows what can be achieved when investment is committed to, put aside and delivered.  Many of these institutions have never been redeveloped although promises have been made in the past.  In many ways, the Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage plan is a political wish list.

This has meant that projects which were at concept stage in 2018 have undergone a rigorous process to fully elaborate the scope of the projects to be delivered, including through undertaking extensive investigative and survey works which are essential.<\/p><p>This has seen flagship projects move from initial concept, to appraisal, to detailed design.  As a result, the projects emerging are better designed, better meet the objectives of the Department and the Government, and are based on the best available cost information than might otherwise be the case.<\/p><p>Over the next few years, there are a number of key projects.  These include a project to provide a secure environmentally controlled archival repository in full compliance with internationally accepted archival storage standards at the National Archives, which is currently being tendered with a view to construction commencing later this year.  There is also an ambitious development of the Crawford Art Gallery, Cork, for which it is anticipated that the planning process will commence later this year.  Moreover, there is a phased re-imagining project of the National Library to enhance the building, visitor experience, collections and works.  Works as part of the earlier phases have already delivered a new and permanent home for the prints and drawings collection in the refurbished former seminar room of the 1827 wing and a state-of-the-art book store, which have both maximised the storage space available.  These works have also provided an appropriate environment in which to safeguard the books.  Design of the final works for the entire development is expected in 2022.<\/p><p>There is also a new development plan for the National Concert Hall complex, including a newly refurbished and extended main auditorium, improved musicians' facilities and a reorganisation of public facilities.  The Department is currently reviewing the preliminary business case submitted in respect of this project.  In addition, there are redevelopment and modernisation works planned at the Chester Beatty Library in conjunction with the Dublin Castle master plan of the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The Department is currently reviewing the preliminary business case submitted and it is expected that an integrated design team will be procured later this year.<\/p><p>The Department is currently reviewing a preliminary business case in respect of the development project at the Abbey Theatre, a flagship development that will re-imagine our national theatre, while also contributing to the regeneration of this historic and important part of Dublin's city centre.  A preliminary business case has also been completed in respect of the Natural History Museum, next door, a branch of the National Museum of Ireland, also next door, and the procurement of an integrated design team is due to commence in parallel with an investigative and preparatory works contract.<\/p><p>The Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, is currently at strategic assessment report stage in respect of the redevelopment of the full site at Kilmainham.<\/p><p>At the National Gallery of Ireland, design and investigative work is under way in respect of 88-90 Merrion Square.  This project will create a new entrance to the gallery, restore and enhance the gallery's library and create fit-for-purpose facilities for gallery administration, curation and research.  In addition, work on the preliminary business case is underway for phase 4 of the National Gallery of Ireland master plan which will provide a detailed appraisal of options and related costs for the gallery's redevelopment.  The National Gallery of Ireland redevelopment will build on the very successful reopening of the gallery's historic wings in 2017, a project, as the Senator has acknowledged, which showcased what is possible when we invest in our national cultural institutions.<\/p><p>The investment programme under the national development plan represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine these important public resources, which contribute very significantly to the social and cultural fabric of our society.  <\/p><p>Just like in the education area, I am very proud to be back in government as part of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, because our commitment and record on the national cultural institutions, on culture and the arts in general, has been very strong throughout our periods of office.  I very much look forward, as does the Senator, to seeing these particular projects which I have mentioned progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#C00600","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that detailed response on behalf of the senior Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.

I have to ask the question why these specific dates were chosen. Are letters of correspondence which came in early or mid-January to be excluded from the debate and the engagement?<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that there will be engagement under this review with all board members and I suggest that they may have a great deal to say.  Who set the terms and chose these dates?  Did the CEO of Inland Fisheries Ireland have a role in this or was it just the Department?

The statement of internal control did not come to any premature conclusions on these items.  Some including property lease, procurement and dormant accounts funding are still subject to investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  All of these issues were very much under active investigation during 1 February to 27 April, so why are they not included in Conleth Bradley&rsquo;s review?  Why was not the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s investigation mentioned by the Minister in the note to Oireachtas Members?  <\/p><p>In response to reports by ASM Accountants and ByrneWallace law firm commissioned by the board, the CEO stood down the Inland Fisheries Ireland outreach and education operation and refused to accept some &euro;800,000 dormant accounts funding in 2021.  The Aasleagh Lodge lease agreement was also ended.  Why did the board, with the agreement of the CEO, take these decisions if it did not think the concerns were serious, as outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s note?  If the Minister&rsquo;s note to Oireachtas Members states that these matters were addressed, why was there no explanation given in the note to Oireachtas Members and why is there no investigation into these matters?  <\/p><p>The Minister&rsquo;s 16 May note also states that it was entirely inaccurate to suggest that an angling club that exists got funding.  IFI confirmed the club has a club constitution, bank accounts and tax clearance.  However, it did not have those when the fund was applied for or when the fund was approved.  How was the funding issued to a club with no bank account?  I think it was issued through a third party and I understand that there was an email thread to this effect.  <\/p><p>Following thorough investigation by the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland, it was discovered that there were 16 uninsured vehicles on the road at the time of a crash involving one of these vehicles on 10 August 2021 in Donegal.  Inaccurate information was presented to the board about the failures within IFI to ensure vehicles were insured.  This is evidence of an organisation that is not able to do its basic work.  <\/p><p>Why, after all this, is it the board that is being investigated?  It is the board that has pursued the truth and carried out investigations into wrongdoing.  It is simply because the board did not go along with the CEO and the Department.  It was independent, as it should be.  It was not willing to bend to the CEO&rsquo;s will if it disagreed.  The Minister, to my disappointment, has agreed to investigate the board, in my view, in the hope that the board will be disbanded and a more obedient board might be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#D01200","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.

These reports have suggested significant irregularities have been identified in the organisation.  On 10 May, these assertions were fully addressed in a detailed information note provided to the Senator setting out the factual position in relation to same.<\/p> <p>The fact is that these issues have been previously considered and addressed through the then chair's statutory statement of internal control, external audit reviews and correspondence between IFI and the Department, and the IFI board's own assessment of these matters, which my Department has accepted.<\/p> <p>It should be noted that the suggestion made in this House and contained in media reports that IFI grant aided, via dormant accounts funding, an angling club that \"did not exist\" are entirely inaccurate.

The focus of the section 18 review by Mr. Bradley is quite specific and relates to issues in correspondence between the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the board members of IFI from the period of 1 Feb to 27 April.  It includes letters of 4 March and 7 April from Department to the then chair, the 22 April letter from the then chair to Department, as well as email notifications and subsequent letters from other board members.<\/p> <p>As part of the review and as required under section 18(4) of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, IFI board members, including those who were members between the above dates but have since resigned, management and personnel are required to co-operate with the review and provide help to Mr. Bradley.

I wish to raise a number of items.  The first is on the decision announced last night regarding the provision of special education regional centres, seemingly across Dublin.  I was surprised and shocked when I read the level of detail that was available.  I appreciate that more is still to come.  This would involve taking children from their communities, segregating them, bringing them into the region away from their communities.  We all know that segregation is the very opposite of inclusion.  Over the past 20 to 25 years, the whole educational process for children with additional and special needs has been towards integration in order that they can learn with their siblings, neighbours and friends within the community.  The fact that this approach has been announced is a retrograde step.  As Inclusion Ireland &ndash; The National Association for People with an Intellectual Disability said, it is ten steps back on the path to inclusive education.  I believe it is a wrong decision.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has said that she would act on section 37 to make sure that local schools would provide adequate places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and I worked hard in the last D&aacute;il on the then Joint Committee on Education and Skills to make sure that was put in place.  I think that process has been initiated too late.  In terms of school planning I cannot understand why places must be looked for so late in the day.  We need to have a debate in this regard. <\/p><p>I also want to raise the new professional body for early childhood and school age professionals, Professional Educators and Managers Ireland, PEMI.  It was officially launched yesterday in Buswells Hotel by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman.  It is important and represents a significant milestone in the drive to professionalise the early childhood and school age profession.  All professions have a professional body that can represent members and act as stakeholders.  This is first time for those in early education.  It is a positive move and I look forward to further engagement with PEMI. <\/p><p>Finally I welcome the commitment of almost &euro;7 million to County Kildare from the Minister for Health.  That will go in particular to Monasterevin for the re-establishment of the day care centre; to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Athy, to a 95-bed unit for older people; and &euro;500,000 will go to the health centre in Kilmeague - I know the Leader was in Kilmeague a few years ago - which is great for the community.  Moreover, a very sizeable amount of almost &euro;4 million will go to Naas General Hospital, which is badly needed for so many services there.  It is a very welcome injection for the health services for people in County Kildare.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#K00500","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the students from Malahide and the Croatian ambassador as he visited the House.  I also wish to express our solidarity with Croatia today.  Today I want to talk about accessibility.  We have come a long way in this country in recent years.  In these Houses in the past 15 years, accessibility has been facilitated in many ways but even this Chamber is still not fully accessible.  Yesterday our colleague, Councillor Vicki Casserly and her son James were here.  James has been highlighting very effectively some of the accessibility issues for wheelchair users throughout the country.  He joins a litany of other wheelchair users who have done this recently, including Paralympian Kerrie Leonard who has been very good at this as well, particularly in the context of sports.<\/p> <p>I want to raise an issue in my own area.  One of my neighbours, Owen Stubbs, is a 23-year-old wheelchair user who lives in Knocksinna in Foxrock.  He and his father Graham now have to take a local developer to court over the effective extinction of a right of way that was available to Owen previously which shortened his journey to a bus stop nearby.  The laneway that he would use is now being replaced by the developer, Richmond Homes, with a series of steps.  It is a nonsensical and unfair step by the developers.  It was not done unknowingly, because I know the family took great pains to ensure the developer was aware of it.  The particular development has caused untold difficulties for people in that area, not the development itself but the access routes.  It now goes through a quiet residential road to Newtownpark Avenue, which will create traffic problems instead of accessing directly the N11.  We are told that is because of regional planning guidelines.  I know we do not have time to go into that.  The notion that any developer or body would essentially reject the expressions of a local resident who is going to be massively discommoded by steps being put into a place like that is perhaps indicative of further overreach by developers but also a failure of local authorities to enforce this.  Part of the planning conditions for this development was for that lane, which is a public right of way, to remain fully and publicly accessible to the public.  Steps are still accessible to people who are not in a wheelchair but the public includes everybody in the public.  You cannot have a situation where a mechanism is put in place that excludes some members of the public and not others.  I want us to make it very clear that we support accessibility measures and do not accept situations where any individual, entity, local authority or State or Government agency is taking steps to reduce accessibility.  I support Owen Stubbs in his campaign to make sure that this remains a properly public and accessible right-of-way.  I hope he is successful in that regard.  I hope everybody involved sees the sense in removing steps and ensuring we have a properly accessible facility for everyone who lives in that area, including those in wheelchairs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#L00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I recently congratulated PDFORRA on its accession to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  I have been informed that in order to be allowed to accede to associate membership of ICTU, the  Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, must go to the courts.  This is a human resources issue, an IR issue, not a legal issue.  I fail to understand why we are compelling RACO to go to the courts.  I ask the Leader to engage with the Minister to have it dealt with through the conciliation and arbitration scheme that is available, rather than go to the courts.<\/p> <p>Over the last few sessions I have alluded to the search and rescue operations and the rejection of the 415-page submission by the Air Corps.  Freedom of Information requests, FOIs, have been coming into me over the last few days.  I am going to share every document I have with every Member of this House because there is a level of arrogance coming from the Department of Transport - an unintelligent consumer of the service - which is unbelievable.  The level of bias, dismissing highly qualified professionals who put forward a 415-page submission, is not only wrong but it will cost this State &euro;400 million over the life of the contract that we should not pay.  I do not care if the Air Corps never gets it but I want an intelligent consumer to oversee this. <\/p> <p>The other piece of madness in this country which I had the privilege personally to look at was in Derrybrien, County Galway, at the weekend.  Some 70 turbines producing enough electricity for 50,000 houses were decommissioned, stopped in their tracks because of something that happened in 2003 regarding an environmental impact assessment.  There is a claim about a mudslide.  I saw where the mudslide was.  It is completely taken over again by nature.  That is what nature does.  There are miles of roads and fibre-optic cables in Derrybrien.  There is an electric grid going into Derrybrien.  There are 70 turbines in Derrybrien sitting idle, which cost this State &euro;70 million.  If they are to be decommissioned it will take two and a half or three years to get planning permission to decommission them.  We will never be able to restore Derrybrien to what it was before the turbines were put in.  For God&rsquo;s sake, in the middle of an international energy emergency, can we not go back to the EU and say we need to put this right?  I believe that particular establishment made over &euro;11.8 million for the State in one year.  In the month of January alone, &euro;1.8 million was returned to the State in profits.  I fully accept planning permissions must be followed through legally.  However, it has been in operation for 20 years and nobody has said a word.  Over those 20 years only two people have shown an objection.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

We know the devastating impact and consequences of gambling addition on individuals and families throughout this State.  We have discussed and debated it.  We have heard very passionate contributions from Members.  In terms of protecting the integrity of this House as we prepare to debate very important and necessary gambling regulation legislation, a policy of no comment is no longer sustainable and acceptable.  It is important that the space is created for colleagues who are referenced in the media to address the very legitimate and understandable concerns that are out there.<\/p> <p>Finally, on the points raised today and the issue of passports, I note and welcome the increase in coverage of the passport issue in the media in recent times.  However, I wish to make a fundamental point and observation.  We can change the name of certain services.  We can ask for a junior Minister.  I would like to hear the arguments for that.  I am not saying I am opposed to it.  Unless we get to the point where we are investing in proper services where people can interface and engage directly with the passport service, we are not going to deal with the issues that I am sure all of us right across the House are dealing with all the time.  The vast bulk of people I deal with will accept that there will be a delay in obtaining their passport.  Their biggest frustration and problem is the total absence of any information.  I am sure that like me, the Leader and her constituency colleagues have spent hours on the phone trying to get through to someone on behalf of families who are waiting anxiously to find out details about their passport applications.  We need to light a candle as opposed to curse the dark, as it were.  The Government needs to understand that this policy of hoping the issue will settle and balance out at some stage is not cutting it.  We can see that it is not working.  We need proper investment.  We need facilities, offices and services that people can engage with, to enable them to access a human being, speak to someone and get information that they can then absorb and understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#M00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I wish to interrupt proceedings for a moment to welcome to the Visitors Gallery 11-year-old Cara Darmody, who is sitting the junior certificate maths paper next month to raise awareness for autism.

It is a glaring and worrying omission from the soon-to-be published Bill that people who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 will not be afforded their human rights.  As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health, over a period of months I have chaired meetings as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021, which will reform the Mental Health Act 2001.  The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 are linked and are both hugely important in progressing and realising the rights of people with psychosocial disabilities, rights which they have under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  I am seriously concerned that the Government will miss this opportunity to meet the State's obligation under the UNCRPD by extending rights around capacity to people with psychosocial disabilities.  I am also concerned that we have undertaken pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 and that two of the Department of Health amendments will require the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 to be amended.  In the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, there is a commitment to commence the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to abolish wardships.  This is necessary to meet our obligations under the UNCRPD.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021 went to Cabinet last Tuesday.  It is now expected to be rushed through both Houses within a month.  The target is for a commencement date of 20 June for the decision support service.  It is very unlikely that that target will be met.<\/p> <p>During the very brief pre-legislative scrutiny for the Bill, Mental Health Reform and others highlighted that people involuntarily detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 were excluded from the provisions of the 2015 Act.  The Government's mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, is person-centred and underlined by principles of human rights and recovery.  Yet, involuntary patients do not have the right to have their advance wishes about treatment respected.  People who are detained in hospitals for mental health treatment are specifically excluded from legally-binding advance healthcare directives.  It is very worrying that they have no legal right to have their advance wishes respected, even though they had capacity to make decisions about their mental healthcare and treatment at the time of making their directive.  There is no other group of individuals that is specifically excluded from this legal right.  The exclusion is contrary to international human rights standards, including the UNCRPD.  I ask the Minister to address the House to provide clarity on the exclusion of people detained under the Mental Health Act from the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021.  The omission risks undermining Ireland's commitment to UNCRPD compliance and creating discordance between the legislation and the general scheme of the The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#M00400","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I wish to join with Leas-Chathaoirleach and other colleagues in welcoming the Darmody family, especially Cara, to the Visitors Gallery.

Senator Horkan and I are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  We have done a lot of work on pre-legislative scrutiny around the regulations concerning the use of e-scooters.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Transport has said that it will be at least 2023 before the long-awaited regulations are introduced.  As we know, the capital city of Dublin and cities like Cork have been left behind while every other big city in Europe has introduced e-scooters, and had them legalised and regularised.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House for an urgent debate on the regulation of e-scooters and to discuss the new Road Traffic and Roads Bill so that the legislation can be teased out in here in an informal way.  We must also allow local authorities to begin to plan for the shared e-scooter schemes.  We have seen the success of these shared schemes for e-scooters in many European cities and we have expressions of interest in this country from a number of users.  I hope that we can see what is now called powered personal transporters, which is a wonderful name for e-scooters, being regularised.  I hope that the Leader will facilitate a debate on the use of e-scooters prior to the summer recess if we do not have legislation ready.  E-scooters are currently being used illegally in Irish cities and cause great angst.  An e-scooter is a wonderful way to get around and a sustainable mode of transport.

The development will consist of 569 two-bedroom single-storey homes.  This emergency accommodation campsite will house around 2,300 Ukrainian refugees in a village with a population of only a couple of thousand people.  Needless to say, the plans have raised a few eyebrows and it does not sit easy with me.  I am 100% against the development of any more direct provision-style housing or camps.  I believe that an even spread of refugee intake according to the ability of a local area to adequately care for them is the best way forward.  The development seems to be a solution born of convenience and is not for the Ukrainian people who find themselves here but for the Government, which wants to keep them all in one spot to make it easier to deal with them.  Last week or a few weeks ago, I asked in this House for a centralised response to the crisis but I did not mean that we had to centralise the people themselves.<\/p> <p>Under delivering is a natural result of over promising.  The Government&rsquo;s policy of an uncapped intake of people fleeing the Russian invasion will result in reduced quality care and services for those who end up in this country.  Ireland must do all that it can to help but we must have a serious conversation on how far we can go.  We owe it to the refugees that we have taken in to treat them properly and putting thousands of them into a custom-built segregated site falls short of that.<\/p> <p>All that being said, if the Government insists on pursuing this course of action, then it should throw up a few more temporary houses for every person in direct provision.  If we are going to pay the fixed costs anyway, then we might as well make a few more units and treat all of our refugees equally.<\/p> <p>There is a 150-acre site at Thornton Hall in north County Dublin.  The State paid &euro;30 million for the site but it is being rented out for &euro;200 a month.  Surely to God one does not need to be a genius to come up with solutions and find ways to build sustainable, long-term housing for people who need it, not only for refugees but people on the social housing lists and people who seek affordable housing.

Most sixth years are finishing this week and, therefore, we should acknowledge that they have had a difficult time.  They are leaving second level education and will head out into the world.  I wish them all well with their exams and their future.  Equally, I wish their families, friends and everybody who has been involved in their education well.  I thank everyone in the school community, including the teaching staff and the ancillary staff, including secretaries, caretakers, coaches and grounds people.  These are all of the people who make education what it is.  During the pandemic people appreciated how hard teachers work because they experienced what it is like to teach.  Students were at home all day and every day while their parents or guardians tried to run their own lives and work lives yet simultaneously try to keep people involved with education.  I pay tribute to this year's sixth year students who will shortly head out into the world.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wish them the best and I encourage them to try their best; that is all they can do.

There is no proper database available that people can readily access on people with autism and their access to education.  Education is a right in this country but unfortunately and sadly, it is not a right for all families.  It should not be down to AsIAm to establish the facts surrounding this; rather the Government needs to lead on it.  However, I would encourage every family that has a child or young person with autism who is not accessing appropriate education to fill out the survey, which will enable AsIAm to campaign effectively for more resources, including targeted resources, and to ensure the resources are focused in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#O00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I echo the call regarding the post office in Caherconlish.  One of the things that amazed me as I was getting into this issue this week is that Caherconlish has doubled its population in the last decade to 1,500 people so it is hard to understand how a post office there would not be viable.  It would be great if the Leader would be kind enough to write to the Minister to see what else can be done to support the people of Caherconlish.<\/p> <p>The key issue I want to speak on today is housing.  I found it chilling to hear that last Monday in Limerick alone, some 80 eviction notices were received by the homeless action team there.  From speaking to colleagues, this is not uncommon across the country and there has been a huge rise in eviction notices.  The people we are speaking to who deal with housing in Limerick have never been more concerned, and that is saying something given the last few years we have been through.<\/p> <p>The following point is not party political; I hope it is just a common sense point.  We need to declare a housing emergency and put a ban on evictions.  Things are already extremely bad and despite the best efforts in spin, things are getting worse and not better.  If one takes the time to speak to officials, particularly the officials in Limerick, they will confirm that.  We have a perfect tsunami of massive evictions and a 15% rise in rents in Limerick, and we have a ridiculously low threshold such that if one earns more than &euro;32,500 one does not even qualify for social housing.  People are trapped in a rental market that is getting ever more vicious with the rise in rents.<\/p> <p>We have a terrible situation with the Shannon Arms property with 150 people, including 60 families, being made homeless by landlords.  They say they will do up the properties on a big scale but we also see that when they have gotten rid of tenants they have brought new ones in at even more extortionate rents, particularly exploiting foreign nationals.  This again points to the fact that we do not have proper tenant rights in this country.  I would seriously ask my Government colleagues what it is that they see wrong with Irish tenants that they will not give them the same rights that are enjoyed across most of Europe regarding security of tenure.  We are in a housing emergency and I am calling for an urgent debate on the matter.  I am genuinely concerned at what we will say to people in the coming weeks in Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#O00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome Cara and her parents.

They will all be proud of her and I am sure they are cheering her on.<\/p> <p>I would like to raise the provision of abortion care.  As we all know, it is four years since the vast majority of people in Ireland voted to repeal the eighth amendment and for the provision of abortion care.  However, today only one in ten GPs are offering abortion care, in 50% of our counties there are fewer than ten GPs offering abortion care and only 11 out of the 19 maternity hospitals are providing abortion care.  This means that women in a distressed situation who are vulnerable have to travel long distances.  This is adding to their stress and vulnerability and it is also creating an urban-rural divide.  There is a difference between the care potentially provided to a woman in Dublin and a woman in Longford and Carlow, and we all know that is wrong.<\/p> <p>To be fair to the Minister for Health, no other Minister for Health has done so much for women's health.  Some &euro;31 million is ring-fenced this year alone for women's health, including for the following: the provision of free contraception; free period poverty measures; endometriosis and menopause clinics; and significant capital funding for the Rotunda Hospital in my constituency of Dublin Central.<\/p> <p>There has also been the creation, for the first time, of a real and secular national maternity hospital on the site of St. Vincent's University Hospital, which will provide all women with healthcare services, free of any sort of religious interference.  It would be helpful for the Leader to write to the CEO of the HSE.  We all know the review of the legislation is taking place.  When it comes to the operation of the services, we should ask the HSE what actions it is taking to support GPs and our maternity hospitals to ensure that abortion care is freely available to women in every community in our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#O00500","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#O00600","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>We will take Senator Lombard, who has been waiting for a long time, followed by Senator Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#O00700","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I acknowledge and welcome our distinguished guests in the Gallery.  It is great to have them here and they did a wonderful interview on the radio this morning.  I congratulate them and they are more than welcome.<\/p> <p>I will address a theme that the Leader and the Leas-Chathaoirleach are well aware of and that I have often spoken about, that is, dyslexia services.  We have an issue in that many schools are doing something called Drumcondra tests, which most Members are aware of.  That basically means that the end-of-year assessments go to the Department.  Many students use technology to help them read, particularly in subjects like English, but more importantly at times, for mathematics as well.  We have some schools that do not know whether or not the technology should be allowed for those Drumcondra tests are not.<\/p> <p>I was contacted by a woman during the week who informed me that her child's school's proposal is to do two exams, one with the technology and one without it, and that they would then see where her daughter is after that.  I had another lady on to me in the last half an hour and the technology was just taken away from her child for the exams.  There is an awful lot happening here and it is not just the mental stress of it but there is a lack of policy from the Department.  The Department does not know how to deal with technology and it does not know where it is appropriate and where it is not.  If anything, it is putting its head in the sand for the last three or four years and it has not come forward.<\/p> <p>I have continually raised this issue and we need to get clarification when it comes to these State exams for primary school students who are using technology every day of the week.  Can they use it for their State exams in these Drumcondra tests?  To me, it is like taking glasses away from a person who needs them to read and making them do an exam.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is appalling and is causing such stress on the children and families and, in some regards, on the teachers also, who are completely frustrated by the lack of direction from the Department.  <\/p><p>I ask the Leader to write to the Department of Education to bring clarity to this issue and to give direction to the principals of the primary schools of Ireland because at the moment, 10% of our primary school population have no direction on this issue.

I ask the Leader for a debate on radon gas.  Overnight, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, published a report with shocking figures.  It says that there are 17,000 houses at risk from radon gas.  It talks about the link, in particular, to various cancers but, in particular, to lung cancer.  Radon gas is a serious public health issue around this country and it needs to be addressed.  I have suggested today at another group meeting that we should look at a building energy rating-type certification for every property that now comes on the market in respect of a test for radon gas.  All sites where new housing is being built should also be tested for radon.  It should be mandatory over a phased period of possibly five years, in that there should be a radon certificate for every single home in this State.  The evidence is clear and is sharply linked to a major increase in lung cancer.  The EPA posted all of this information on its website this morning.  More importantly, it has posted an interactive map of the entire country which I looked at this morning.  One can put in one&rsquo;s Eircode and can identify one&rsquo;s home or site as to its potential exposure to radon gas.<\/p> <p>I am also calling that these maps would be interactive with county development plan maps at some point in the future.  In the meantime, they should be on display in all of our 31 local authorities because people need to know about them.  We need a public campaign on radon gas based upon facts that have been released and are now published on the EPA website this morning.  We need to tell people in their communities right across this country that they can go on to these interactive maps today, as I have gone on one already, and can see and identify the potential exposure to radon gas where they live.<\/p> <p>This is an important issue upon which we need to have a debate at some point.  I know that there are other issues around problems with particular sites so this is a very big issue.  We need to look at it and to have a reasonable debate based upon the facts in respect of radon gas and the serious challenges that it is now causing and will cause to public health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#P00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator very much and I thank him for his patience earlier.

There are enough issues of concern and which we would like to see expedited.<\/p> <p>In Merlin Park University Hospital, I welcome the appraisal of a plan to develop a new cystic fibrosis unit as well as a ground and first floor outpatient department with 50 consulting rooms.

This is very important.  <\/p> <p>The new build will also seek to provide for emerging needs by the inclusion of a ten-bed dementia unit and rooms that can accommodate bariatric residents.

I have heard all week about the financial supports on the way for our post offices, but we need to make sure that happens before there are closures.  The Senator referred to small rural communities, and Senator Gavan pointed out that these communities are growing.  Post offices are vitally important for communities.  People from larger towns and cities do not really appreciate how important post offices are in smaller communities.  We need to support them and ensure they maintain their businesses.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan raised the issue of planning permission for 569 houses in south County Meath.  As is the case for me, a number of people have contacted her.  I have made inquiries with the Minister regarding the nature and type of, as well as the infrastructural amenities required for, such a community.  Once I have that information, I will come back to the Senator.  I take her point about Thornton Hall.  It is a site I pass every single day.  It has the best roads, light, facilities, water and sewerage, yet it is a town waiting to be built.  I am not sure what we are waiting on.  That is another days work.<\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on the road traffic Bill, in particular with regard to e-scooters.  I will organise that as soon as I can.<\/p> <p>Senator Wilson spoke about Independence Day in Georgia.  I wish the Georgians well.<\/p> <p>The Senator also mentioned the inclusion of RACO in ICTU negotiations and the upcoming public sector talks.  It needs to be included and I hope the issue is resolved today because I am quite aware that the Minister's intention is to include it.  We should do that today.  He also suggested that we have a passport office in the north west, something echoed by other colleagues in the past number of days.<\/p> <p>Senator Black is looking for a debate on an incredibly important issue.  It is one that is somehow slipping between two stools, namely, pre-legislative scrutiny of the mental health legislation and the capacity Bill that is currently being drafted by the Minister.  We have to ensure that people's civil and human rights are upheld.  Anybody who makes his or her expressed wishes known for medical treatment, whether it be mental or physical health, when in the whole of his or her health, and had the capacity to do so, has to have his or her wished honoured.  That should be enshrined in legislation.  We will organise that debate as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile welcome to the coverage, albeit negative, regarding passports in the past couple of days.  He asked for clarity on the information people receive when applying for passports in order to ensure that they will not be obliged to wait weeks.

I will speak to amendments Nos. 145 and 146.  They both seek to address the inclusion of online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person in the list of non-offence specific categories in the Bill.  Both amendments aim to achieve a similar end, but go about doing so in different ways.  Amendment No. 145 seeks to delete the inclusion of &quot;online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person&quot; in the list of non-offence specific harmful online content.  This particular amendment is a straight deletion of the definition of &quot;harmful online content&quot; as it stands, which is defined as &quot;online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person&quot;.  In my view, the definition currently provided in the Bill is vague and ill-defined, to such an extent that it is unsuitable for inclusion in legislation.<\/p><p>It is not clear from the existing definition what sort of content would constitute bullying or humiliating content.  As a result, this provision creates a huge potential for overreach by social media platforms.  For example, will they be so concerned about being stung by this regulation that they will overcompensate by removing all potentially humiliating content from their online platforms, or will they begin to remove posts where citizens ridicule the decisions of policymakers and legislators for fear that the language being used is too humiliating?  The vagueness and subjectivity of this term makes it completely inappropriate for a legislative provision.  By making this provision, we risk granting social media platforms an inappropriate level of discretion over what sort of speech they allow on their platforms and what sort of speech they suppress.  It would be reckless of us as policymakers to include such provisions in important legislation, which will grant powers to social media providers to limit the free speech of users.<\/p><p>Additionally, no clear division is created here between the content which is acceptable criticism and that which is unacceptable humiliation.  One fundamental principle of which we should be mindful when creating laws is that the people the laws apply to should be able to understand and correctly interpret them.  I do not think this is possible if we maintain the inclusion of a vague definition.  This is a serious civil liberties concern.  It is unclear what threshold is being created in the Bill given that the wording is so ambiguous.  Is the threshold on bullying or humiliating behaviour?  Does criticism of a person in authority count as humiliating behaviour?  This wording sets worrying foundations whereby we could find public figures who exert enormous power over politics and the economy seeking to make themselves immune from ridicule or criticism.  There needs to be a clear and more well defined threshold by which we can easily separate out criticism and even ridicule from behaviour which is actual bullying.<\/p><p>We are all interested in preventing bullying online.  It is clear that is a common goal we all share, but we cannot do this with such a broad and crude provision in the Bill as it stands, which does not seek to give bullying behaviour a proper definition.  I stress again that this wording is in conflict with the principles we should follow as legislators, that is, that people should be able to read the law and know how to follow it.  The way this section is currently drafted, it is not clear that someone would be able to read this provision and know whether they are breaking the rules by ridiculing a powerful person online.  In my view, it either needs to be removed from the Bill, as amendment No. 145 would achieve, or be further clarified, as amendment No. 146 seeks to achieve.  Alternatively, it could be clarified by the Minister and the Department by means of the introduction of a ministerial amendment on Report Stage.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 146 is an alternative to amendment No. 145.  It seeks to replace the language in section 139A(3)(a) with:<\/p> <blockquote> \t&quot;online content by which a person sends repeated, abusive communications to another person, to an extent that a reasonable person would conclude constituted intimidating or bullying behaviour.&quot; <\/blockquote> <p>In this way, we can seek to create a clear threshold that would separate legitimate criticism and disagreement online from actual bullying behaviour.  This amendment, rather than simply deleting the vague definition of bullying or humiliating content, seeks to replace the definition with a stronger one that is less open to interpretation.  This amendment seeks to create a clearer and less ambiguous threshold, which would allow online providers to actually identify the kinds of bullying content which the original definition seeks to capture.  This amendment defines bullying content as &quot;repeated, abusive communications&quot;.<\/p><p>This makes sense as, for example, we would not want social media platforms to simply remove messages that legitimately criticise the decisions made by people in positions of authority.  We must be conscious of the fact that the way in which people engage with the issues of the time has changed.  A significant portion of our communication takes place online or on social media platforms and while certain language that can be directed at people in positions of authority might sometimes not seem like the kindest, sometimes it is an absolutely legitimate expression of political dissatisfaction.  To ask online providers to suppress this kind of speech would be a gross overreach.  I am sure that everyone here in the House has been subject to messages of criticism online, but just because the language invoked by an individual in this way might cause offence to us as individuals, that does not mean that we should legislate for people not to be able to express their frustration or dissatisfaction in this way.  By inserting the new definition, the legislation would instead identify bullying behaviour as behaviour which consists of repeated, abusive communications, which a reasonable person would believe constitutes bullying.<\/p><p>It is my hope that this clearer definition would fulfil the intended aim of the original provision, which is to put a stop to bullying behaviour online without unintentionally creating a chilling effect, whereby social media providers overcompensate by removing all negative, critical posts from their platforms.  Again, we all wish to restrict bullying behaviour online, but we cannot simply discard civil liberties concerns in order to do so.  This amendment creates a much clearer threshold in this Bill whereby the average person would clearly understand that bullying behaviour is unacceptable, while legitimate criticism and dispute is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#V01500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for tabling amendments Nos. 145 and 146 regarding the definition of cyberbullying in the Bill.

Ms Frances Haugen appeared before the joint committee in February and agreed that disinformation should be included as a type of harmful content.

I do not propose to accept the amendment for a number of reasons.  Disinformation and false information intended to mislead is being tackled on an EU-wide basis through a number of mechanisms, including the Digital Services Act, political agreement on which was agreed on Friday, 22 April.  The Government has decided that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will be the digital service co-ordinator which is the primary regulator under the Digital Services Act.  My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has led Ireland's negotiations on the Digital Services Act.  <\/p> <p>The EU code of practice on disinformation is a Commission initiative which has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation.  It is the Commission's intention that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act.<\/p> <p>In addition, the Commission has also established the European Digital Media Observatory, which has a hub in DCU and which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code.  While I note the intent of the amendment, the matter will be addressed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the Digital Services Act in Ireland.  I do not believe it would be useful to cut across this work at this stage.<\/p> <p>Senators will be aware that in March the Government decided that once established under the Bill, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n would act as the primary regulator termed the digital service co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act.  It made the decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and the approaches of Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n and the digital services co-ordinator, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement.<\/p> <p>The Digital Services Act is still undergoing negotiation on a number of technical matters.

This was discussed in one of our previous meetings with the Department and it seemed interested by this approach at the time.  I am not sure if this still the case.  Section 139D of the Bill defines a separate category of &quot;age-inappropriate content&quot;, which is not the same as harmful content but rather something which adults can be safely exposed to but children cannot.  In the Bill, it is defined as including pornography or representations of violence.<\/p><p>This is a very helpful category to define within the Bill.  We need to acknowledge that there are some types of content to which adults can be safely exposed, while children cannot.  It is strange to me then that this category of content is defined but is barely used at all in any of the later mechanisms set up by the Bill.  The only place it seems to be used is when issuing guidance materials by the commission.  There it has the option of having regard to the risks of exposure to age-inappropriate content.  <\/p><p>Since the Bill already goes to the trouble of defining this special category of material that is suitable for adults but not children, we could better use that definition by expanding it and perhaps adding further mechanisms later in the Bill whereby that type of content should be limited automatically by platforms.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, there is a stipulation later in the Bill - I might have to come back on the section; I think it is section 139 but I will double-check.  It stipulates that the commission can demand content is either limited or removed.  If it is outright harmful content, it can be removed, but the power of limiting content remains vague.  Why not attach this power specifically to age-inappropriate content?  Then the platforms - they already do this in many cases - could use automated means to detect and limit age-inappropriate content, in order that it never appears on the timeline of minors.  This age-inappropriate content could include age-inappropriate advertising, as we discussed in previous amendments.  This would be a new approach to limiting that kind of advertising.<\/p><p>Our amendment seeks to insert a new paragraph to extend the definition of age-inappropriate online content to include advertisements for products that are potentially harmful to the public health of minors.  This would allow for a ban on targeting of this type of advertising at children, while still allowing it to be targeted at adults on online platforms.  This is a different and possibly better mechanism to control advertising to children within the Bill.  Currently, this seems to be left up to the media service and online safety codes, and it is not clear what type of advertising will actually be banned to children following the development of these codes.  By better utilising the definition of age-inappropriate content, and actually defining certain types of advertising as age-inappropriate content, we can hardwire child safety measures into the Bill.  We can ensure that we are explicitly identifying that these types of advertising are harmful to children, which we know they are.  Also, it is a more efficient use of the mechanisms already created within the Bill, as currently the useful category of age-inappropriate content is poorly used within the remainder of the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 165 seeks to add a subsection to section 139D, providing that notwithstanding anything in this section, content which seeks to educate children on the effects of violence or acts of cruelty in an age-appropriate manner shall not be considered age-inappropriate online content.  This is to ensure that educational material is still available on these subjects and is not unduly restricted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#X03100","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 164, in which Sinn F&eacute;in calls for the new media commission to produce a directive outlining appropriate minimum age requirements for children to create online accounts.

The harms of the metaverse in particular are not yet clear.  There have been incidents of sexual assault.  We would like the media commission to bring forward proposals on a minimum age requirement for children's online accounts, which would apply to all of the social media companies, 2D screen, the metaverse and so on.

I accept it is not primarily a piece of responsibility for the media commission but given its work, which relates precisely to the points that have been made, it is something of which the commission is going to have to be conscious.  The primary focus of the role of the new office of the online safety commissioner will probably end up being around children's safety online and we will need to have regard to this.

In terms of amendment No. 164 regarding a minimum age requirement for children, it is important to acknowledge that there is a very real issue with young children accessing online services that simply were not designed with them in mind.  It is an issue that I am particularly aware of both as a parent of young children and as chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety.  Finding workable solutions in this area raises a number of complex issues, including privacy and data protection matters that would need to be resolved before a solution could be effectively implemented.<\/p> <p>In this regard, it is useful to note that an EU-funded pilot called euCONSENT is in development.  The pilot aims to deliver a system for online age verification and parental consent, which balances the rights of children and the need to protect them from online harm and age-inappropriate content.  The outcome of this pilot will inform any approach taken to this issue at an EU and national level.<\/p> <p>While I cannot accept this amendment, I will be asking an coimisi&uacute;n to look at this issue as a priority in conjunction with the Data Protection Commission and to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue.  Not everything can be dealt with in a single item of legislation, but what matters is that we put the framework in place.<\/p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 163, I note that section 139K of the 2009 Act, as inserted by this Bill, provides coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n with the power to create binding safety codes to ensure \"that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children\".<\/p> <p>Further to this, section 139K specifically provides that, in respect of providers of video-sharing platform services, that an coimisi&uacute;n shall make online safety codes requiring those providers to comply with the requirements of Article 9(1) of the revised directive in respect of advertisements directly placed by the provider and user-generated advertisements.  This includes a long list of requirements, including regarding the protection of children.  As such, given the extensive provision already in the Bill for the regulation of online commercial communication, I will not be accepting this amendment.<\/p> <p>I understand the intention of amendment No. 165 in seeking to clarify that the definition of age-inappropriate content used in the Bill should not preclude educational material.  However, I do not believe that this provision would have this effect due to its framing with regard to the capabilities, development, rights and interests of children.  Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#Y00400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I will be brief, as I am conscious that others have debated the issue.  I am happy to engage further with the Minister on it.  Even though I understand where amendment No. 164 is coming from, we had extensive debate on very similar issues when the data protection legislation was going through.  It is not simply the age of consent in terms of when one begins to have an online account, the question is what one may consent to.  Even parental consent is often not a great screen sometimes because, while it may be fine in terms of that content, the problem is what the data are then used for.  That is where the question of the commercial regulation is crucial in this area, and perhaps enhancing those provisions in terms of the commercial communications.  The section, which was inserted on our behalf in the Data Protection Act, sought not simply to have an age at which a child might sign up, based on the idea of a digital age of consent, but if somebody does sign up at 12 or 14, his or her data should not be able to be gathered and he or she should not be construed as giving consent to other uses of that data, such as commercial marketing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Basically, we went by limiting how children were targeted by commercial actors rather than just limiting or regulating the point of access for children.  It put a burden on those who are engaging in online commercial activities that target children.  That might sometimes be a more effective way of coming at this issue.  I would note, notwithstanding our own amendment, which I will withdraw and reserve the right to come back on with regard to education, that I respect that we want to get the issue of educational information in order that children are empowered and can know what they are dealing with.<\/p><p>I would have one caveat that comes between the two, however.  Since we started debating this Bill, it has been brought to my attention that educational online video material for children, even though that material may itself be very educational and positive, often harvests the data of children in some cases.  There is, therefore, a real need to ensure that if a person accesses positive educational online content, to which many parents will say \"Yes\" and give consent and everything else, there is not a link between that educational online provider and a number of commercial actors that many then use the data.

In addition to this, last week, the European Commission proposed a new regulation on combating child sexual abuse.

They are the same points I have made throughout.  Again, perhaps by addressing them comprehensively in the powers and functions section, we will not need to address them in another place.  It is, however, part of a general principle of ensuring that those considerations are there in terms of the public duty on equality and human rights, particularly with regard to the online safety codes because there is that kind of harm protection role.  We know that persons who fall under, for example, the equality grounds in Ireland may be especially vulnerable.  It would be important that the coimisi&uacute;n would have regard to that public duty on equality and human rights when considering which providers should fall into that category.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 167 would insert a caveat that when deciding whether an online provider falls into the category of providers, it would have due regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  That is very much linked to amendment No. 168.  These are around trying to embed different considerations.  The reason I am bringing them in repeatedly is because these are things to which Ireland has signed up but that are often not embedded or part of something we think about constantly.<\/p><p>I referenced the UNCRPD, which Ireland has ratified, but I also referenced the web accessibility directive, which is now law from the EU but is, again, somewhat unevenly applied.  This directive sets requirements that there would be levels of accessibility in terms of online websites and providers.  It started at one stage and has now moved through to phones and websites, so it is working in a wider space.  It has been a phased application of the web accessibility directive.  As I understand it, it should now be fully applied.  Again, that means that when the commission is thinking about the safety codes, it might also be thinking about those measures.  A small example of something that overlaps between safety and the web accessibility directive, which is something we will come to later, is that question of having, for example, flashing images that create effects and that may cause seizures for certain persons.  It is an example of something that overlaps between online safety and the web accessibility directive.  People should not have that risk to access online sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#Z01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>These amendments would require an coimisi&uacute;n to have regard to a number of legislative instruments when designating a relevant online service to which online safety codes may be applied.

It is very important that there be transparency in respect of records, especially since this is an area involving very large amounts of money.  It is a very significant area and it is really important that there be absolute transparency.  Not only that, but there almost must be seen to be transparency in regard to how the commission performs its functions.  This is necessary to engender the wide public trust that is essential to its successful operation.<\/p><p>At set out in the Bill, when it comes to designating an online service, the commission may consult a number of relevant persons.  I have suggested who those people might be.  The Bill also specifies that the commission may consult any other person it considers appropriate.  My amendment proposes that where any such consultation under subsection (1) takes place, there should be a record of that consultation having happened and, in the case of consultations carried out under subsection (1)(d), which allows for consultation with any other persons the commission considers appropriate, the record should also include the rationale under which the commission deemed those persons appropriate to consult.  I have further proposed that these records be deposited with the Minister and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps they do not need to be laid before the Houses but, for accountability purposes, there certainly needs to be a record of such consultations.<\/p><p>We had a similar debate around another area in which I was looking for transparency.  I ask the Minister to address this issue in order that we can move forward.  There is the principle of the records existing and then there is the principle of where they should be deposited, whether with the Minister and-or before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would be useful if she could address both principles in order that we can narrow our proposals down towards something acceptable on Report Stage.  On the general principle of transparency, I note that similar amendments have been accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in respect of climate legislation, and by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in respect of housing legislation.  It has been a general practice that where there is consultation, we should endeavour to ensure it is known that such a consultation has occurred.  That is constructive and positive and it builds public trust.<\/p><p>Will the Minister respond to those two points, that is, the question of there being a record and the question of where such records should be deposited?  The principle of transparency is really important.  Where the commission is engaging with a major online company, lobbyist or any other body, some of that engagement will be captured under the lobbying legislation, but some of it will not.

This amendment proposes that the company must also give clear information regarding the individual within that company, organisation or platform who is responsible for online safety.

I understand amendment No. 71 sought to achieve a similar effect.  As referenced by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in response to that amendment, it is not usual practice to lay internal records of the processes and activities of public bodies before the Oireachtas, nor for the Oireachtas Library to store such materials.<\/p> <p>I understand the intention of the amendment is to ensure an coimisi&uacute;n is transparent in respect of those persons it seeks to consult.  However, as a public body, an coimisi&uacute;n will be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability requirements, including to the joint Oireachtas committee.  The principle of transparency is satisfied by the requirement for the commission to be accountable to the Oireachtas.  As set out in the Bill, the executive chairperson and the commissioners will be accountable to the joint Oireachtas committee in respect of their functions, while the executive chairperson will additionally be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the finances and value-for-money practices of an coimisi&uacute;n.  The decisions of an coimisi&uacute;n as regards the making of media service codes, rules and online safety codes are also subject to a clear public consultation process.  Furthermore, details of those decisions must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, where they may be subject to a negative resolution procedure.  As a regulator, an coimisi&uacute;n will necessarily be in contact with regulated entities on a regular basis regarding the regulation of those entities.

Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 170 would require the contact details of the person or persons designated as responsible for online safety at the named service to be entered into the public register of designated online services.

Any of us who sit on a committee know there are two hours in which to cover every issue at a meeting.  We should not have to ask people to read out a list of everybody with whom they have met.  This is basic information that it should be possible to request and access.  It should not be a matter of having to put in freedom of information requests to find out who was consulted or having to drag that information out through committee work.

The information should be part of the record.<\/p> <p>I accept the Minister's point that it is not usual practice to lay an internal document from a public body before the Oireachtas.  However, there should be a rationale given as to why the commission decided to meet with somebody.  Even if she does not want to include the rationale, because that is something that could be asked about in a committee, the idea of not specifying that there be a record of the consultations is a problem.  There should be such a record.  As I said, the same principle has been established in regard to other legislation.  It is part of a general improvement in how we do things and part of building public confidence.  The State's job is not simply to hand everything over to bodies and say it hopes they will do their best.

I would like to see a requirement for providing a rationale, but I understand the concerns in that regard.  However, the simple requirement for a record of consultations made is important.

Nobody has pressed any amendment where there is any indication of potential progress.

I reiterate that the purpose of establishing the independent regulatory body of an coimisi&uacute;n under this Bill is to delegate the exercise of powers from the Oireachtas to that body in accordance with Article 15.2.2 of the Constitution.  That a body delegated such powers has discretion in the exercise of such powers within the strictures of legislation is appropriate.  It is in the spirit of the provisions on the independence of regulatory bodies in the revised audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD.<\/p> <p>In addition, changing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in those provisions would create a mandatory obligation in every instance which, given the breadth of the provisions, may create a problem.

It is a great step forward but this Bill, as drafted, does not go far enough to create parity between digital and conventional media.  This amendment will make sure the public health interests of children are explicitly considered by the regulators overseeing the digital sphere.  This is particularly important because young people are spending more and more time in digital spaces and consuming digital media.  They are watching less conventional media.  It is important that regulations that govern advertising reflect this reality.<\/p> <p>The online world is run on advertising.  It is totally pervasive.  Online advertising can be discreet, explicit and subtle.  It can be incorporated into online content through sponsorships and product placement.  This obscures the distinctions between entertainment, information and advertising.  These blurred lines make online advertising more effective, particularly for younger or more vulnerable consumers who are not equipped with the media literacy and critical capacity of the standard adult.  Given the huge amount of time young people spend consuming this digital content, as well as the insidiously effective mechanisms at play with digital advertising, it is vital that online regulators are empowered to take action against harmful advertising with the public health interests of children in mind.<\/p> <p>This legislation already contains that brilliant language that gives due weight to the importance of protecting children's health.  This amendment is a rather modest one which seeks to replicate the Bill&rsquo;s already effective language in the section that covers digital media.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment, which will strengthen the Bill and will ensure parity for regulation across different types of content.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Amendment No. 176 is a copy of a provision in Part 5, Chapter 3, dealing with media services codes and media services rules that may prohibit the advertising of high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks in commercial communications on media services, recognising the &ldquo;general public health interests of children&rdquo;.  This was part of the transposition of the audiovisual media services directive.  The Bill already makes provision for restrictions on junk food and drink advertising on media services in the public health interests of children.  This amendment would simply extend that to online services.  It is using the text of the Bill to extend protections to children from harmful marketing into the online world.  It also includes identical restrictions on the advertisement of gambling and alcohol.  The evidence is unequivocal that the marketing of nutritionally poor food affects children&rsquo;s consumption preferences, purchase requests, consumption choices and, ultimately, their health.  Bearing in mind the high rates of child obesity and related non-communicable diseases throughout the European Union, the effective regulation of marketing practices that incentivise the consumption of nutritionally poor food is urgently needed.<\/p><p>The imposition of online restrictions on the marketing of junk food and drinks to protect children from harm is even more warranted as the marketing strategies used to promote such products are increasingly integrated, immersive and personalised, and therefore likely to cause harm and create long-term behavioural patterns.  General comment No. 25 of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in respect of the digital environment calls on states to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration when regulating advertising and other forms of marketing addressed and accessible to children.  We are seeing the deployment of a vast array of big data and adtech tools to tap into online cultural spaces, and to infiltrate them with powerful promotions for some of the unhealthiest products on the market.  There exists a large, integrated, data-driven digital marketing system, fuelled by big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  This has created a powerful, pervasive and immersive digital environment that is harming children&rsquo;s health, furthering health inequities, and contributing to increasingly higher levels of disease in the population.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic triggered a dramatic increase in people&rsquo;s screen time.  Children and teens whose schools closed relied on YouTube for educational videos, attending virtual classes on Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom, and flocking to TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram for entertainment and social interaction.  This constant immersion in digital culture has exposed them to a steady flow of marketing for unhealthy products, much of it under the radar of parents and teachers.  Unfortunately, the Bill as currently drafted does not appreciate the key role online marketing plays in eroding children&rsquo;s health.  Today&rsquo;s youth, from infancy through to adolescence, are at the epicentre of an exploding digital media and marketing landscape.  This Bill provides a unique opportunity to address this through amendment of Part 11, Chapter 3, on online safety codes.  By not including a ban on alcohol advertising to children in the online safety and media regulation Bill, we would allow an unacceptable gap in protection to continue.  There is an illogical reality where in real world settings we have laws to ensure there are no alcohol ads in proximity to children&rsquo;s environments such as schools, playgrounds, etc. but in the digital space, where children are spending increasing quantities of time, we are allowing the alcohol industry to put ads in the palms of the hands of our children 24-7.<\/p><p>This amendment is in the spirit of the Bill.  It aims to put an end to the day of the Internet operating as a wild west where standards are lower and anything goes.  There is a clear gap in how we choose to protect children from harmful advertising.  The way to remedy this is by way of this amendment which specifically prohibits the advertising of alcohol, gambling and high fat, salt and sugar foods in the online spaces that children inhabit.  Only by naming these harmful products can we ensure that this will be enforced.  We know that advertising these products to children is wrong and this should not be a battle that needs fighting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#BB01300","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I want to speak on amendments Nos. 173 and 174.

I join Senator Black in thanking the Irish Heart Foundation for its engagement in respect of this Bill.  I thank former Senator Kathryn Reilly for her work and for the Irish Heart Foundation's work on all Stages of this Bill and for their interest in it.  It is grounded in a huge amount of work by the World Health Organization, as Senator Black has mentioned and by UNICEF.  In its 2019 report, Children, Food and Nutrition - Growing Well in a Changing World, UNICEF called for a broad regulatory framework for food marketing to children, encompassing TV, video games, film, books and social media for all age groups, as well as businesses and restaurants that give away toys to market unhealthy food.

I also want to thank the individuals who have contacted us with their concerns on the online targeting of children and the kinds of content to which children are being exposed and targeted.  The fact that the Minister can see amendments in this grouping from Sinn F&eacute;in, the Civic Engagement Group, the Labour Party and many others shows that these concerns are common.  I urge the Minister to engage in the context of the fact that there is value in the different proposals that have been put forward.  The clear and general signal is that in the media service codes there was some acknowledgement of that public health component in respect of children and they acknowledged that the online codes should similarly have some form of recognition.  Amendments Nos. 172 and 173 are minimalist in nature.  They simply seek to recognise the public health interests of children.  There is the other suite of issues that have been identified.<\/p> <p>I will highlight two things that are not in my amendment in this grouping but that are valuable.  If the Minister is coming back with her own proposal, I would be open to all of these issues being dealt with in that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is recognition in Senator Black's proposal of commercial communications in gambling that target children.  That is an issue that goes from the loot box we talked about in this House to other areas where gambling is targeted at children.  Very young people can be exposed very quickly to gambling.  That is a very important example.  Senators have tabled amendments on trans-fatty acid, sugars and salts and it is mentioned in the original Bill, which is a clear sign the Minister recognises their dangers.  The other issue is gambling and the fact that it affects children.<\/p><p>The Labour group has spoken at length, and I will not prolong it, about recognising that milk-based formula and follow-on milks aimed at young children is something that is a public health concern.  They include that in the definition of public health concern.  Whatever changes we come to on Report Stage, in terms of recognising this issue, I hope it will be reflected in the online codes as well as the media service codes given what I highlighted earlier, that some of the areas of code are about online service providers, such as baby clubs, targeted messages, the expert-mum forum pop-ups people are invited to.<\/p><p>Senator Ruane and I put forward amendment No. 183 in this section.  What is important about this amendment, and I urge that it be listened to, is that it does not just speak to online content.  It speaks to the fact that online safety codes should provide for restrictions on the use of personal data of children for profiling, micro-targeting, or direct marketing.  This is about the recommender system and data gathering.  It is about providing data for one purpose.  Senator Black outlined the extent to which parents have had to rely on online educational resources during a significant period of online home education for example.  Any such material that targets children should not store information in respect of the children's ages.  If people want to access education materials through an online education provider, and they have children of this age and that age in the house, they should not receive advertisements based on the children's age.  That should not be the case and it should not be allowed.<\/p><p>I emphasise this issue because I am very frustrated by it.  It was identified as a key issue in 2018.  We had the agreement of all parties to put it into the Data Protection Act.  It was not commenced because there was a concern about the wording, but it has never been addressed.  It has been four years since then and of the information we learn about the online targeting and profiling of children and how their information is used, there has been no comforting information.  The issue has only worsened.  We constantly hear of news scandals about the harvesting of information and so forth, and this issue still has not been addressed.  That is why we push to have measures put into legislation because if they are not included and strongly committed to, they may not happen.<\/p><p>I ask that the Minister take on board the minimalist point on public health, the points everybody is making about high-fat and salty foods, the points on gambling, on breast milk substitutes, and on alcohol.  Alcohol is being targeted at children, effectively and indirectly, which was acknowledged by Senator Carrigy.  It is not just a question of the content but how it is reaching children.  The Minister has some concrete solid proposals that could, through this Bill, set an agenda for online safety codes.  If the commission were given a signal politically, from us, through this legislation, that these are areas we expect it to work on, it would be incredibly positive and it would set an agenda.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned that the purpose of this Bill is the delegation of powers.  The purpose is not the delegation of powers.  The purpose of this Bill is media and online regulation.  We are entrusting some of that to be delivered by a commission that will be established.  It is absolutely within the rights of the Legislature and the Government to send signals to the commission as to how we want that done.  We are not giving them full discretion in that regard.  We are giving them the responsibilities and duties and we should be sending the signal as to the areas we expect to be addressed.  That does not exclude the commission from identifying other areas that we have not thought of.  If these areas are heard as common concerns from across society and the House, they should be put on the agenda for online safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#CC00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I recognise the objective behind these amendments, which is to specify that an coimisi&uacute;n may protect the health of children by regulating, through online safety codes, commercial communications relating to certain products, including foods high in fat, sugar, salt, as well as alcohol and gambling products.  In this regard, I note that an coimisi&uacute;n already has this power under the Bill and, in particular, in relation to the regulation of commercial communications on video sharing platform services, which must abide by the provisions set out in Article 9(1) of the revised audiovisual media services directive.  However, in taking any action in this area, an coimisi&uacute;n would be guided by the policies of the Department of Health, which is responsible for public health policy on these matters.<\/p> <p>I see the merit of specifically referencing the public health interests of children in this section.

If a provision in the Data Protection Act has not been commenced, the issue that arises is the commencement of that provision by the Minister for Justice, not repeating those provisions in another Act, one that deals with content regulation and not data protection.

Measures aimed at content delivery based on the profiling of children are relevant to this Bill.  It is very important that we put a marker down.  When this area is talked about in the public realm, what ends up being talked about is children.  When people talk about online regulation to anyone on any street corner or in a taxi, to a friend at dinner, they talk about children.  The fact is that we have failed to provide measures against the gathering of children's data, them being targeted and profiled and sent material that is inappropriate to them in an inappropriate way.  We did not do it properly in 2018 when we had the chance.  As I said, this Government and a previous Government have failed to do it in the meantime.

Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights.  As a public body, an coimisi&uacute;n would already be subject to the provisions of that Act.  Similar to other UN conventions that have been ratified and entered into, the State is legally bound by the obligations set out in the treaties.  I do not see the rationale for specifically referencing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in context of making online safety codes.  Further to this and regarding the web accessibility directive, as I said, this directive only applies to public bodies and, therefore, its legal relevance to the making of online safety codes is unclear.  Therefore, I do not intend to accept amendment No. 179.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 180, in the first instance, I note that under the amending section 139(1)(b) that an coimisi&uacute;n shall consult with any person it thinks appropriate in advance of making an online safety code.  While, in practice, this will be a matter for an coimisi&uacute;n, I would see this as covering the persons referenced in the amendment.  In addition, I would see it as inappropriate to single out persons with expertise in a limited field who must be consulted.  This may give rise to the impression that the views of those persons should be held in higher regard than those not explicitly referenced.  It would also be impractical and quite difficult to provide for an exhaustive list of such persons who must be consulted in advance of making an online safety code.  Generally, however, it is the expectation that there will be a strong culture of consultation with relevant persons and stakeholders when it comes to the creation of regulatory codes.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 180.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#EE01800","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653557400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 180:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 82, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(4A) In preparing such codes referred to in subsection (1), the Commission shall consult with appropriate persons with relevant expertise in human  <blockquote> \trights and digital public participation.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#EE02100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653557400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 are out of order as they would impose a potential charge on Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#EE02300","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653557400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 183:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 83, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:  \t<b>&ldquo;Online safety codes: public health of children <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>139L<\/b>.

They all relate to disinformation.  Their goal is to recognise that disinformation is not simply problematic because of its impact on the general public but that it can cause harm.  Disinformation can be a cause of harm to the individual, for example disinformation on health.  We have seen the very serious consequences of disinformation during the Covid pandemic.  Disinformation has a wider implication.  It can be used to create dangers for individuals based on their groups.  Misinformation can be created in terms of categories of persons with regard to nationality.  It can be used to encourage people to make poor decisions.  It can have political outcomes.  It can also have directly personal outcomes.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned that the digital services directive will look at the issue of disinformation.  There is a weird aspect with the Bill because in some ways it reaches into the area of the digital services directive, for example by the inclusion in its provisions of interpersonal communication or cloud storage, which I believe may be inappropriate or premature.  In other ways it does not address issues even though there is a significant overlap with the directive.  Disinformation is being addressed, considered and recognised as a significant problem at EU level.  It is also a source of online harm to individuals.  I suggest that perhaps it should be included as something that will be addressed in the online safety codes.  The other amendments are consequential.  They reiterate this point on disinformation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#GG00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 183a provides that an coimisi&uacute;n should have an online safety code requiring that designated online services seek to minimise the risk of harm arising from the spread of disinformation.

These include the Digital Services Act, DSA, on which political agreement was reached on 22 April 2022.<\/p><p>The Government decided that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will be the digital services co-ordinator, which is the primary regulator under the DSA.  My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department have led Ireland&rsquo;s negotiations in this area.  There is also the European Commission's code of practice on disinformation.  This is a Commission initiative that has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players signing up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation.  It is the Commission's intention that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the DSA.  Additionally, the Commission has also established the European Digital Media Observatory, which has a hub in Dublin City University, DCU, and this body has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code.<\/p><p>While I note the intent of the amendment, this matter will be addressed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the DSA in Ireland.  I do not believe it would be useful to cut across this work at this stage.<\/p><p>Senators will be aware that in March the Government decided that once established under the Bill, coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n would act as the primary regulator, termed the digital service co-ordinator, under the DSA.  It made the decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and the digital services co-ordinator, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement.  The DSA is still undergoing negotiation regarding several technical matters.  The final text of the regulation is not available.  Should the code of practice on disinformation evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the DSA, as proposed by the European Commission, I would expect that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n would have a role to play in its capacity as the digital services co-ordinator.<\/p><p>As I indicated, there is a specific problem with disinformation designed to influence the results of elections and referendums as these processes are at the heart of our democracy.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals for inclusion in the Electoral Reform Bill 2022.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 187a, similar to amendment No. 183a, I do not propose to accept the amendment because, as previously set out, disinformation is being tackled on an EU-wide level through the mechanisms outlined.  I do not want to unintentionally work at cross purposes with those mechanisms or with the work of the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The same reasons apply to amendment No. 192a in the context of my responses to amendments Nos. 183a and 187a.  I am not proposing to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#GG00400","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>While I understand that the digital services directive will be coming through, the T&aacute;naiste and officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are looking at this from one perspective, namely, regarding services and digital services.  The Minister, however, has the capacity to look at from another angle, in much the same way as she mentioned that her colleague would be bringing forward measures concerning disinformation in the Electoral Reform Bill 2022.  That will, of course, not undermine the T&aacute;naiste's work in bringing forward measures in this context as well as part of the digital services legislation, when that arrives, because there is specific recognition of issues of potential harm in electoral processes.<\/p> <p>Similarly, amendment No. 187a seeks to bring nuance to this provision.  I accept that amendment No. 183a is prescriptive, whereas amendment No. 187a is quite minimalist.  It is not asking the Minister to deal with all aspects of disinformation, but only disinformation insofar as it causes online harm.  The electoral issue is one issue but there is also the matter of harm caused to individuals, specifically the serious harm to health caused during the pandemic by misinformation and disinformation.<\/p> <p>While I appreciate it is the Minister&rsquo;s expectation that this kind of provision will come about as part of the future regulatory framework, I ask if it might be possible to send a signal in this regard now.  Regarding other issues that are going to come under the digital services directive, specifically cloud storage and interpersonal communications, rather than include them in the Bill, it would be better to send a signal that they may be included, subject to certain things.  I am suggesting there may be capacity to put in a building block in this regard.  If that is not possible, I ask the Minister to clarify that there is nothing in the Bill that precludes the commission, even now, from identifying and addressing an issue such as disinformation, if it so wished, within an online safety code.  I suggest this because the advent of the digital services directive might be five years away, as the Minister said, and disinformation can do much harm in the meantime in areas from extending from Covid-19 to climate to politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#HH00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>To clarify, the purpose of the Bill is not to implement the DSA regulation in Irish law but, among other things, to create a regulatory framework for online safety and to establish a regulator to enforce that framework.

Again, what we want to avoid here are fishing exercises and hashing, for example.  These aspects have been extensively debated in respect of the digital services directive.  The Minister mentioned that measures are coming forward in the context of that directive, but she can use her existing powers where it is necessary and proportionate to address issues of online targeting.  <\/p><p>I refer to a situation where there is a need to investigate, for example.  This is the kind of debate that arises in the context of GDPR all the time.  If there is a need to investigate and prosecute, then it is permissible to access appropriate material but it is not permissible to engage in sweeping exercises to find content that may potentially end up being relevant to an offence.  There must be a reason and a necessity which meets a test of proportionality.  It is not permissible, for example, to examine all, or even large swathes, of content in someone&rsquo;s interpersonal communications, such as all someone's WhatsApp messages, just because a particular type of content is being sought.  It is necessary to have reasonable grounds to do so and it must be necessary and proportionate for an investigation and prosecution.<\/p><p>As it stands, this legislation is framed so that it relates &quot;to content that falls within one of the offence-specific categories&quot;.  Therefore, it would be possible to have a situation whereby interpersonal communications are subject to large-scale surveillance because of a rationale relating to an offence.  For example, hashing involves putting certain words in a search and then scanning a huge quantity of data to see if those specific words appear anywhere.  Then there is follow-up, which creates a dynamic that falls outside proportionality under the GDPR.In the data services directive, it has been recognised that such practices are not appropriate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am worried about the way that it is framed in this Bill as it is a very wide sweep.

These measures will likely be part of the digital services directive when it comes through.  The amendment states: &quot;An online safety code as defined in subsection (5) in respect of an interpersonal communications service or a private online storage service shall prohibit the use of encryption backdoors or client-side scanning&quot;, which are practices that have been identified as being very problematic in respect of the digital services directive.  These have been very extensively debated at European level.  They are flagged in the balance that has always been sought between having appropriate accountability and measures for safety, and also ensuring appropriate data protection and care for private life.<\/p><p>These are measures so that the online safety code, in respect of interpersonal communications, includes the prohibition of encryption backdoors, which allow, for example, the State to access anything.  Let us bear in mind that this one of the really key provisions.  The use of and demand for such backdoors in the United States is one of the reasons, for example, privacy shields and other measures in terms of the exchange of data between the EU and the US ran aground.  That was because those were not properly clarified and there were no proper safeguards in place.<\/p><p>With regard to &quot;client-side scanning&quot;, the idea is that there would be wholesale scanning of the interpersonal communications of persons who are using phone exchange services.  I do not suggest that there are not situations where there are areas that need to be appropriately investigated.  There are measures, such as warrants, that can be used in respect of those rather than the idea of a backdoor or routine scanning process.<\/p><p>These matters are quite serious and are a problem.  Another way to address them would be for the interpersonal communications and private online storage services, which do not fall within the remit of the AVMS directive, to be bracketed aside and then added through the legislation the Minister has mentioned is going to be introduced regarding the digital services directive.  These are digital services, effectively, rather than online broadcast or online spaces in the classic sense of being public spaces or public services being accessed.  It would be more appropriate that they be addressed under digital services directive legislation.  If they are not going to be addressed in that way, we need to make sure that the key safety concerns, which were identified during the digital services debate, are reflected in this Bill as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#JJ01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the amendment.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is not to prohibit the use of technologies by providers of designated online services and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment<b>.  <\/b>The technologies referenced by this amendment have legitimate uses.

As she will be aware, the Digital Services Act, which is a proposed regulation rather than a directive, of the EU, is currently under negotiation between the EU institutions.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is leading on this.  The Digital Services Act, as a horizontal legislative instrument, will address a wide range of issues, from illegal and harmful online content to consumer rights issues such as availability of illegal goods on online platforms.  It will introduce a new systemic regulatory for very large online platforms that will be overseen by the European Commission.  I understand that provisional political agreement between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, representing the member states, was recently reached, subject to further technical discussions and amendments.  As such, the final text of the Digital Services Act has not been formally agreed and is not yet available.<\/p> <p>A key feature of the Digital Services Act will be the appointment of a digital service co-ordinator.  As I stated, in March the Government decided an coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will fulfil that role.  A programme of work is now under way, led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to identify the appropriate resources necessary for an coimisi&uacute;n and the legislative measures necessary to implement the Digital Services Act into Irish law.  Although the Digital Services Act, as an EU regulation, will have a direct effect on Irish law, it has become increasingly necessary to provide legal scaffolding in domestic law to give effect to provisions of regulations, particularly regulatory provisions.  For example, there is a need to provide for the designation of competent authorities or for penalties and enforcement mechanisms for infringements of a regulation.<\/p> <p>Although the Digital Services Act is forthcoming, the requirement to transpose the revised audiovisual media services directive, which we are doing through the Bill, remains.  In light of the infringement proceedings under way against Ireland for a failure to transpose the Bill, it is important that we transpose the directive as soon as possible to avoid fines.  Moreover, given that an coimisi&uacute;n will also fulfil the function of the digital service co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act, it is important that we put that on a formal legislative footing as soon as possible.  In establishing an coimisi&uacute;n and setting out a regulatory framework for online safety and a robust and fair enforcement and investigation mechanism, the Bill is establishing the scaffolding to which I referred, as well as the structures to support future and forthcoming legislation, including the Digital Services Act.  In this regard, the Bill will assist in the implementation of the regulation and it will not, therefore, hinder it.

It is of vital importance.  It strengthens the powers of our competition authorities to effectively enforce competition law, creating a fairer environment for Irish businesses and consumers.  The Bill has passed through the D&aacute;il and it was great to witness the cross-party support that exists for its provisions.<\/p> <p>I think it is accepted by most Members of this House that the transformation of this country&rsquo;s economy from an inward-looking and State-dominated economic model to one of export-orientated growth, dynamic competition and increased choice for citizens has resulted in unimaginable societal and economic progress for the State and its people in the past 30 years or so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Robert Troy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Much of this progress arose from policy decisions made and voted on by the Oireachtas driven by the desire of previous Members of this House to end the relentless emigration of our people and to pursue the idea that this nation&rsquo;s living standards could be as good, if not better, than our European neighbours.  We have, as a country, surpassed even those goals, not by accident, but by decisive and deliberate efforts of the Government to ensure that Ireland continues to have a competitive economy, not for its own purpose but to fund a fair and inclusive society, with high levels of educational attainment, good quality employment and social supports for our citizens.<br\/><br\/>The advance of our integration in the EU&rsquo;s Internal Market has not only created record-level employment, it has also benefited our citizens in the choice of goods and services they can access here for competitive prices.  We are all well aware however, that there are sections of our economy that are less competitive than others.  Indeed, in some instances, they have conspired to keep it that way.  All of us are far too aware of sectors that still have high costs associated with the services they provide, resulting in high profits but underwhelming services.  We know practices that drive out competition, that drive up costs for ordinary citizens and that undermine the dynamic nature of our economy. This is why I am particularly determined to introduce this Bill to the House today for Senators&rsquo; consideration.  I hope this legislation will go a long way in deliberately disrupting firms and companies that do not play fair, that try to drive out competition and that seek to rig the system to increase profits in an unfair way.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the Bill before the House today is to introduce measures that will strengthen the powers of our national competition authorities and to give them greater tools to tackle anti-competitive practices.  For too long, the State has been seen as soft on rogue businesses and those seeking to game the system.  This view, whether justified or not, does significant damage to the credibility of Ireland as a place to do business and it undermines the confidence our people have in Government and Government agencies. <br\/><br\/>We see continued frustration with the high cost of insurance in this country which is driving many small enterprises and community groups out of business.  The impact on local employment and creativity when this occurs can be profound.  I share that deep frustration.  Despite some of the most significant reforms made in the law pertaining to competition, consumer rights and personal injuries in recent years, premiums have not dropped sufficiently and uniformly despite assurances made by the insurance sector.  I think it is fair to say that the outcome of the recent investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, into the motor insurance market leaves questions unanswered.  It also shows the need for legislation, which I am introducing today. <br\/><br\/>Let me be clear; this Government wants to see severe consequences for companies that engage in price-fixing, bid rigging or in any other forms of anti-competitive practices which do damage to our economy and our people.  We believe that unlawful actions by companies should have strict and severe consequences.  There needs to be proper penalties for unlawful actions.  That is the reason and purpose of the introduction of this Bill today.  We are seeking to give teeth to our agencies that are charged with protecting consumers and our economy.  We need to properly resource those agencies and give them the powers required through legislation to carry out their tasks both efficiently and effectively.<br\/><br\/>As Members of this House will know, Ireland has two national administrative competition authorities, namely, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  This Bill will transpose the ECN+ directive.  This will mean that for the first time in Ireland, competition law can be enforced through administrative actions taken by competition authorities.  The European Competition Network, ECN, is composed of the Commission along with national competition authorities from each member state.  <br\/><br\/>It became apparent to the network that there are a number of areas in which existing EU law is insufficient to meet the objective of a fair Internal Market for everyone.  These include, but are not limited to, giving national competition authorities the means to impose effective fines and implement leniency programmes.  The ECN+ directive intends to fill some of the gaps that exist in the current system.  The new powers given by the ECN+ directive will only apply where there is an interstate trade element.<br\/><br\/>In deciding to implement this directive through primary legislation, the Government felt that it was important that the same sanctions should also apply to breaches of national competition law.  This will avoid having two parallel systems with differing sanctions.  The stated aims of the ECN+ directive are as follows: to ensure that all national competition authorities have effective investigation and decision-making tools; to ensure that all national competition authorities have the ability to impose effective deterrent fines; to ensure that all national competition authorities have a well-designed leniency programme in place which facilitates applying for leniency in multiple jurisdictions; and to ensure that the national competition authorities have sufficient resources and can enforce EU competition rules independently.  <br\/><br\/>The date given by the Commission for transposition of this directive was 4 February 2021.  Unfortunately, we, along with several other member states, did not manage to transpose this directive by this deadline.  I do not need to tell the Senators how incredibly difficult the last two years have been, or about the significant legislative burden that the pandemic has placed on both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a difficulty we share with our European counterparts.<br\/><br\/>Particular to the Irish context, however, was our unique constitutional position.  Transposing the ECN+ directive raised significant constitutional considerations, given the particular role of the courts in the Irish Constitution.  The constitutional concerns included the introduction of the concept of administrative sanctions, periodic penalty payments, interim measures and leniency provisions.  Ireland has robust defences against the administration of justice by any body, save for the Judiciary.  In order to transpose this directive in a way that is compatible with Irish law, it was necessary to consult with a number of legal experts to ensure that the legislation would be workable. <br\/><br\/>Additionally, in April 2021, the Supreme Court issued a majority judgment in the case of Zalewski <i>v<\/i>. the Workplace Relations Commission and others, which had a significant impact on the drafting of the Bill which was quite advanced at that stage.  A previous decision of the High Court had concluded that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, was not administering justice within the meaning of Article 34 of the Constitution.  The judgment in this case overturned this decision.  The Supreme Court agreed that the adjudication service of the Workplace Relations Commission does constitute the administration of justice, which has been traditionally regarded as the exclusive preserve of the courts.  However, the majority decision also concluded that the adjudication service of the WRC is not repugnant to the Constitution because it found that the administration of justice is limited.<br\/><br\/>Limited administration of justice is permissible under Article 37 of the Constitution.  While the Zalewski judgement was supremely helpful in clarifying how the administration of justice can be achieved within the parameters of the Constitution, in the case of this Bill, it required a fundamental redesign of how the provisions relating to administrative sanctions would work at quite a late stage in original drafting.  The main changes introduced on foot of the Zalewski judgment have been around ensuring that adjudication officers are independent in their functions, that the process of adjudication and the process of investigation are separate and distinct, and that the procedures surrounding the imposition of administrative financial sanctions are clear and transparent.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also provides for court confirmation of the decisions of adjudication officers and the ability to appeal those decisions.  The delay in bringing this Bill to this House is regretted but it was imperative that this directive was transposed in a way that is constitutionally solid and that provides our competition authorities with the tools they need to effectively challenge anti-competitive conduct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#KK00800","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Well done.

It speaks to the fact that we believe that where there is fair competition, it will benefit the consumer.  Fianna F&aacute;il, as a pro-business party and party in government, believes it is important to support business while at the same time ensuring a level playing field for everyone competing within the sector.  In that sense, I am heartened by the fact that this legislation strengthens the role of the CCPC.  At times, we need &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; to stand up against the erosion of bureaucracy.  People sometimes give out about red tape but we need to have standards to ensure competition and fair trade, in addition to sufficiently strong regulators with qualified staff and sufficient powers and resources to tackle the problem.<\/p><p>We are aware and have seen evidence of cartels operating in certain sectors in recent times.  The CCPC has done a lot of work to try to tackle that.  We have got to be able to ensure consumers are getting the best value, which is achieved by ensuring fair competition.<\/p><p>I note that much emphasis is placed on fines for those who engage in unlawful practices.  I am a big supporter of levying extensive fines but the problem is that many companies measure fines against the potential profit that might be gained from engaging in unlawful activity or in a cartel and then simply write the fines off as business costs.  We cannot have circumstances in which companies are asking whether they will make a lot of money if they take a risk, making it worthwhile to bear the brunt of the fines.  Therefore, it is important that those who willingly and recklessly engage in anti-competitive behaviour be held personally responsible.  Directors of companies that engage in behaviour that is not in the interest of the consumer should be personally held to account.  That would include prison sentences.<\/p><p>While it is important to consider giving the CCPC more power, particularly to tackle cartels, that in itself will not automatically mean more competition.  Let me refer to one of the problems in several sectors of our society, including insurance, banking and financial services.  One could certainly say that, in theory, there is no cartel and that there is insufficient competition simply because, in many cases, there are too few players in the market.  As the Minister of State has committed to, we need to consider a whole-of-government approach to competition.  The Central Bank has no role in ensuring competition.  Therefore, it has no role in insurance, financial and banking services.  We know that, in Ireland, we are paying some of the highest prices for our banking, financial and insurance products, partly because of the lack of competition.  We are aware that players are leaving the market.  This is not necessarily because of a cartel.  The way to ensure greater competition is to ensure all our regulators regard the matter as a priority.  While this legislation is very welcome, it does not address some of the problems concerning the lack of competition in the market, as opposed to anti-competitive practices.<\/p><p>That said, this is very positive legislation.  The challenge concerns how we measure and ensure that when the Bill is enacted, the CCPC will have sufficient resources to tackle any suspected incidents of anti-competitive practice, bribery and so on.  We must also ensure that those engaged in those practices are held responsible.  In that regard, I am very happy to strongly support the Bill.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for all their work in bringing it to this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#LL00300","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it freisin.  Just as my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, was standing in for his party spokesperson, I am standing in for mine, Senator Ahearn, who unfortunately cannot be here but who had a discussion with me about the Bill.  We are certainly happy, on behalf of the Fine Gael group, to welcome it and its provisions.<\/p> <p>I have heard what the Minister of State said about the delay in transposing the directive.  It is regrettable that we missed the deadline but I understand the explanation he has given.  It is obvious from the Bill that considerable work has gone into it.  To echo a point I frequently make in debates in this House, as excellently drafted as this legislation might be, it is pretty illegible regarding its amendment of the 2002 Act.  One cannot read this in isolation.  I have said time and again that when dealing with amending legislation, we should produce a consolidated or revised version because the reality is that, in the future, we will have to work from what the Law Reform Commission does.  There may be a practical element to that but, from the point of view of creating legislation that ordinary people can deal with in a real way, we should, instead of having a section telling us what section has been amended, have a section telling us what the section actually states so it can be very clearly read.  That is a technical drafting point that I feel strongly about.<\/p> <p>It is important to notice, in the context of this legislation, that we are dealing with a quite competitive business environment in this country.  For the most part, we have business sectors and organisations that engage in proper, lawful, considered, competitive activity that benefits us all.  It is tremendously important that we eschew protectionism and put in place laws that ensure anti-competitive practices are not tolerated.  We say that not merely to follow the directive from the European Union and European Commission but to acknowledge that the anti-competitive practices are bad for business.  They make it extremely difficult for new entrants in a market or industry sector to thrive or have a fair opportunity to compete.  They are bad for consumers, customers and citizens within the State.  Not only do they promote higher practices but they also affect the quality of the product or service in question.  It is to the benefit of everybody in Ireland to have a competitive environment that ensures businesses and companies compete against each other to provide not only the best product but also the best product at the best possible price.  That is at the heart of the competition legislation we are debating.<\/p> <p>By extension, it necessarily follows that pro-competitive behaviour and pro-competition measures benefit the economy as a whole.  We have a much more agile, functional economy when we have genuine competition that serves the business sector, consumers and ordinary citizens.  Such competition is good for our economy and means it can grow sustainably.  Those anti-competitive measures and practices that have certainly been present in most sectors in Ireland, although not recently, stifle the economy in no uncertain terms and prevent business sectors from growing.  Therefore, the basis for the competition Acts is very strong.<\/p> <p>It is appropriate to credit the EU for the leadership it has shown to all the member states, including Ireland, in pushing an agenda for greater competition.  In fairness, we do not credit it frequently enough for how it has inspired a change in particular areas.  Things that come to mind are competition and health and safety rules.  The idea is that all the countries come together and state they must promote a culture in a certain vein, with the agreement of all the individual governments.  This means we actually push the required culture on a legislative basis here.  Citizens and those of us in business benefit from that competitive environment when it is realised here.  This has worked very well generally.  It can be seen very clearly when one compares our system with that in countries around the world that pursue protectionist agendas.  I am thinking about the United States, in particular, and how it absolutely stifles the ability of businesses to get involved or provide proper products and services to citizens.  Our system works well and has given us a very modernised and strong economic landscape within which business can work and we can buy goods and services.  That does not mean it is always perfect.  It can be frustrating sometimes when businesses or individuals cannot do something because it is contrary to competition law but, on the whole, we derive great benefit from the leadership of the European Union in this regard.<\/p> <p>Let me say a word about promoting Irish products, notwithstanding the provisions of this legislation and the Act of 2002.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not think either this Bill or the 2002 Act precludes us from promoting Irish products, or products being produced or made in Ireland as opposed to solely by Irish companies.  I understand the reason we cannot promote an Irish company alone but the State should, as I think it is entitled to do, pursue programmes that promote sustainable products that are grown, produced or developed in this country by businesses in this country, not necessarily Irish businesses but businesses that come here and use our raw materials, employees and human resources.  It is legitimate for the Government to pursue those, along the lines of what the Guaranteed Irish label does in pursuing an agenda of buying local and shopping local.  It is important to remember that competition legislation does not stop us from investing in our communities as consumers or from promoting businesses at the local level - shopping local, buying local and even eating and drinking local, which is also important.  In fact, competition law encourages it because it provides products at local level that are attractive to the consumer.<\/p><p>In regard to the technical aspects of the Bill, as I noted this is substantial legislation.  On the sanctions provision, I am generally slow to welcome the removal of matters from the courts but that may be my barristerial mind coming to bear on it.  Having a streamlined administrative process is welcome.  Having the competition authorities, such as the CCPC and the relevant bodies mentioned in the Bill, pursue matters on an administrative basis is streamlined and more effective and efficient, which has to be welcomed.<\/p><p>In regard to the sanctions, as Senator Byrne mentioned, will the Minister of State clarify whether we should look at the personal consequences for individuals who make decisions in regard to anti-competitive behaviour?  Will there be direct personal consequences for white-collar crime, including incarceration?  How will that work?  Will those rules on white-collar crime be properly enforced, as, in fairness, they have been in recent years?  More important, and Senator Byrne also raised this issue, as regards the value of the fines and the disincentive they create, should they be index-linked fashion or set as a function of the profits of a company?  That is where we can really hit people hard.  If a portion of their profits will be taken, as opposed to just a monetary amount which will be more or less significant depending on the turnover of the company, should we look at that?  Will the Minister of State clarify that any fine will not be tax deductible, that is, it will not be deducted from the tax liability of a corporate entity but will have to be paid out of post-tax profits?<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill.

The CCPC investigates suspected anti-competitive practices and tries to bring these damaging practices to an end but can only do so when it is properly resourced.<\/p> <p>This legislation has arisen due to the European Union's ECN+ directive, which aims to ensure that national competition authorities have guarantees of independence, sufficient resources and appropriate powers of enforcement, including the ability to issue fines.  The inability of Irish national competition authorities such as the CCPC to impose administrative fines was identified by the European Commission as a concern and part of the divergence in national powers that led to uneven enforcement of EU competition rules.  As a result, the State has been compelled by the European ECN+ directive to implement legislative changes to ensure the CCPC has the appropriate tools and resources to enforce EU competition law in a manner consistent with other EU member states.<\/p> <p>It is unfortunate that the European Union has had to compel the Irish Government to act in the interests of Irish consumers, especially when we see that the casino capitalism that caused the banking crash still exists in the protected and gilded world of high finance.  The ever unfolding events and allegations of malpractice in respect of high finance, insurance, public procurement and building development, to name but a few, serve as a reinforcement that this Government does not see white-collar crime in the same way that it sees blue-collar and other crime.<\/p> <p>At pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the CCPC stated that international estimates from the OECD suggest the rate of overcharge in public procurement is between 20% and 30%.  The chairperson of the CCPC stated: \"Considering annual State spending of approximately &euro;16 billion on goods and services, if even 1% of it was subject to price-fixing or bid rigging, a surcharge of 20% or 30% would be a substantial sum of money.\"  What is even more infuriating is that in 2007, the accounting firm RSM Robson Rhodes estimated Ireland was losing &euro;2.5 billion a year from economic crime.  If that figure is applied to the past 15 years, it amounts to a potential loss of more than &euro;37 billion to the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>The economic and social costs of corruption and white-collar crime far outweigh other forms of crime.  Despite corporate and economic crime bringing the State to its knees just a decade ago, the area has consistently received far less funding, resources and political attention from successive Governments.  The same goes for media coverage of white-collar crime, where it is painted as almost not a crime at all.  While this legislation is a good start, along with the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021 which established a stand-alone Corporate Enforcement Authority, resources and funding must follow.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support this Bill and will propose a couple of small amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#NN00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining the provisions of the Bill and its transposition into Irish law of EU legislation.  The Labour Party broadly welcomes the Bill and the intention behind it to tackle anti-competitive practice, for instance, where businesses engage in price-fixing and other breaches of competition laws.  Like workers, consumers must be adequately protected throughout the country.  Too often, the interests of big companies are privileged over those of ordinary people.<\/p> <p>It is important that the authorities to which power has been delegated to enforce these rules are adequately funded and given the resources to <\/p> <p>fulfil their brief.  We see these issues across various sectors, whether it be the CCPC, the Data Protection Commission, DPC, or the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  If a body has been set up to allow ordinary people to make complaints and enforce their rights, it should be given teeth to tackle the issues people bring to it.  The purpose of the European Competition Network, through the directive which this Bill is transposing, is to allow national competition authorities the means to impose effective fines to ensure they have sufficient resources.  It is, therefore, welcome.<\/p> <p>The powers set out in the Bill include the ability to fine companies a maximum of &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover for breaches of competition law.  It is vitally important that such breaches are tackled in Ireland but it is equally important that the provisions of the Bill and the intentions behind it are backed up with the reality of implementation.  We must ensure that companies do not find a way to dodge or work around the legislation and its enforcement mechanisms.  We must also ensure that investigating bodies such as the CCPC and ComReg use their powers actively to pursue them.<\/p> <p>It is worth considering how pervasive these issues continue to be in Irish society, whether in the Celtic Tiger years or, more recently, with various issues involving insurance companies.  I have recently been contacted by a number of people who raised what they perceive as the potential for price-fixing in the housing industry.  An increasing number of homes are being advertised as \"price on application\" and people are also being asked to show loan approval.  If people are not told the price of a house, they may want to buy before they have provided the loan approval to the estate agent or equivalent.  In order to fill out the application prospective buyers are being asked to provide extensive personal and, more important in the context of this Bill, financial information.  Prospective buyers are expressing serious concerns to me that once sellers' agents know the relative incomes of the prospective buyer or the amounts they have been approved to borrow, they are pitching the prices of the houses accordingly.  If this is the case, it is unacceptable.  I hope this Bill, by strengthening the powers of the competition authorities, will be able to tackle such issues or at least provide guidance to people on what rights they have under the legislation.<\/p> <p>Inasmuch as the Labour Party broadly welcomes this legislation, we also hope to see the same approach taken to increasing the powers and resources of other administrative bodies such as the RTB without the need for new prompting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#NN00300","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their overall support of the Bill and for their consideration and comments.  Similar points were raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Ward.  I agree with their support of fair trade.  It is not just good for business; it is very good for consumers as well.  It is not just about supporting business but ensuring that consumers have choice.  Where we have better trade and better competition, we will have greater choice and cheaper products and services for consumers.<\/p> <p>The point about consolidated legislation was well made.  It is something about which there needs to be greater consideration across every Department.  I thank Senator Ward for his honesty about his profession and the comment he made about not liking to see business taken away from the courts, but he will know that the burden of proof to bring something to court is always that much higher.  Introducing these new administrative sanctions is about ensuring more people are penalised in a timely fashion - the Senator is nodding in agreement -  which is what we wanted to ensure we could achieve.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of personal accountability and the level of fines companies may be subject to.  I will make the point that existing criminal powers for the CCPC are not being interfered with by this Bill.  Personal accountability for serious criminal breaches will still be a sanction that will be imposed by the courts.  The level of administrative financial sanctions that can potentially be imposed is very significant; Senator Moynihan alluded to them a moment ago.  The Bill will also increase the level of fines that can be imposed by the courts for criminal breaches of competition law.  The penalty for individual criminal breaches will not exceed &euro;50 million or 20% of turnover in the previous financial year, whichever is greater, so by any stretch of the imagination, that is a very serious fine from a criminal perspective.  On the new civil measures, the maximum amount imposed in administrative financial sanctions will be &euro;10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover, whichever is greater, of the undertaking in the preceding financial year.  One of the Senators made the point that it is very important these measures act as a deterrent.  It is not about catching people out and penalising them but deterring them from engaging in the behaviour in the first instance.  To be fair, these measures will do that.<\/p> <p>It is not the case that we are being forced into doing this.  Ireland is a member of the EU.  We feed into this process and into what legislation is needed.  We were very much part of the process.  In fact, the ECN+ directive was designed only to apply to inter-state trade and competition.  In deciding to implement the directive through primary legislation, the Government believed it would be better to go further to ensure the same sanctions would be applicable to national competition law.  We are actually going even further than the EU has requested of us because we want to ensure consistency and that we can enhance competition through our own national competition law.  When I come to this House, Senator Gavan repeatedly makes the point that the Government seems to be soft on white-collar crime.  It is funny that every time he makes that point, I am in the House introducing a further measure to get tougher on white-collar crime, whether it is this legislation, the new corporate enforcement authority or, as the Senator will be aware, the recommendations of the Hamilton review group.  It might suit a narrative to say that we are soft on this form of crime, but we are not.  The proof of the pudding is that we are enacting legislation to ensure that.  I share the Senator's concerns.  I see the damage white-collar crime has done to ordinary citizens.  It is important that we are tough on it, and I share his concerns in that regard.<\/p> <p>The powers being given to the CCPC and ComReg as a result of the Bill will act as a deterrent to anti-competitive behaviour by enterprise and help the Government in its efforts to tackle white-collar crime in our economy, which is a benefit for everyone living and working here, as I said.<\/p> <p>I thank all the Senators for coming to the Chamber to share their thoughts.  I look forward to working with the Seanad on Committee and Report Stage, including on any amendments that may be proposed.  I am certainly not averse to reasonable amendments that will enhance the Bill and improve what we are trying to do.  As I mentioned, the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and has been drafted to reflect several of the key issues outlined in the committee&rsquo;s report.  I hope we can have the support of all Senators to ensure we get this Bill enacted as soon as possible because, as we have all said, it is disappointing we have missed the transposition deadline.  To be fair, we have had broad support in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad today.  I see no reason why we cannot enact this legislation before the summer recess.  I thank all the Senators for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#OO00100","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1653557400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#OO00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022052600002#OO00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1653557400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
