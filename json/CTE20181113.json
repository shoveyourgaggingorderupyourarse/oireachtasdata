Today we are dealing again with the issue of Brexit.  Approximately two years ago this committee published a report on the potential impact of Brexit on the agricultural sector.  To say the least, we found the news was not particularly good in that regard.  As a result of ongoing negotiations over the past number of weeks and months, we decided to get an update on where things are at the moment from an agricultural point of view.  We decided to bring in those directly involved in that sector, including the Irish Exporters Association and the British Irish Chamber of Commerce which we are delighted to have before us here today.  I welcome from the Irish Exporters Association Mr. Simon McKeever, CEO; and from the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Pascal Koenig, communications and public affairs manager, Ms Maree Gallagher, chair of the agrifood committee and Mr. Paul Lynam, head of sectoral policy.  I thank them for coming in today to discuss the impact of Brexit on the agrifood sector and trade.  I also thank them for the submissions they have made in advance of the meeting today.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin I want to bring to the witnesses attention that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official either by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. McKeever to make his opening statement.

I can reassure the committee not an awful lot has got better since we were last here.  I do not propose to read the first page of my submission which is just general introductory remarks  and I will start in the middle of page two of our submission.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Exporters Association, IEA,  welcomed the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s invitation to contribute and we thank the committee for having us here today.  We have taken note of the various challenges and recommendations the committee addresses in its publication for the European Union, Ireland-UK trade relations as well as trade, competition, and other sector-specific policies.<\/p> <p>  In particular, we welcome the report&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the various challenges and risks Brexit presents to Irish businesses through likely reductions in exports to the UK and increased competition with UK exporters in other market, including our own market, particularly if the pound stays the way it is at the moment, as well as the potentially negative impacts of the reintroduction of tariffs and customs.<\/p> <p>  Since the publication of the joint committee&rsquo;s report in February 2017, negotiations on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal had successfully reached sufficient progress in December 2017 with the publication of the draft withdrawal agreement in February 2018.<\/p> <p>Although, according to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, between 90% and 95% of the withdrawal agreement is finalised, key differences surrounding the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland Border, the Good Friday Agreement and protected geographical indicators continue to hold up negotiations.<\/p> <p>  As I go through our submission, I  will draw on an ongoing piece of research we do, which is our Export Eye survey.  We have updated it to include some new bits and pieces.  We have been running this survey for the last couple of years and have some early indications of what people are saying and we thought it would be very useful to bring it in today.<\/p> <p>  On the recommendations of other parliamentary reports on agriculture, food and the marine, we have taken note of them, including the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU&rsquo;s June 2017 report, Brexit: Implications and Potential Solutions.  In particular, the IEA welcomes the report&rsquo;s detailed analyses of the potential impacts and responding solutions needed to address the different potential post-Brexit scenarios for an Ireland-UK trading relationship.<\/p> <p>  To get into the meat of what we want to tell the committee today, we will discuss preparations and preparedness for Brexit and the current status of negotiations, including any agreement on the future EU-UK relationship.  While an increasing number of Irish exporters across the varying business sectors are stepping up their Brexit preparedness, a still large number of IEA members do not have either preparedness or mitigation plans in place.  This, by and large, is due to the largely complex and in-flux nature of the ongoing negotiations on the UK withdrawal agreement.  IEA members continue to state their concern about the large number of unknown unknowns, and the difficulty to understand how or what to prepare for.  In any case, with the assistance of ourselves and others, member and non-member businesses have already undertaken significant steps to diversify their export markets and to train and educate their respective staff on the customs and other procedures.<\/p> <p>  According to initial responses from the IEA's ongoing Brexit and its impact on your business survey, nine out of ten IEA members who responded to the question are very or somewhat aware of the implications of a soft or hard Brexit scenario on their business operations.  Almost 75% of initial responses stated that they are extremely or very aware of the state of play in the ongoing Brexit negotiations.  The converse of that is that 25% are somewhat in the dark about it as well, which is something of a worry.<\/p> <p>  In general, IEA members have put in place Brexit impact mitigation measures, with preliminary results of our survey indicating that, of those that have responded to this question, all had decided to put in place at least one Brexit mitigation measure.  However, at the same time only slightly more than half of all respondents indicated that they have a formal or non-formal impact mitigation plan in place.  Of those members with a mitigation plan in place, the deadline for implementation is between January and March 2019.<\/p> <p>  Anecdotally, many of our companies have asked about how much this will cost and are sitting with their finger on the button.  I was talking to one company recently that has actually decided to spend the money it has earmarked for it.  By and large, companies are not.  They are waiting with their finger on the buzzer to see if they implement this or not.<\/p> <p>  Plans are predominantly designed around a no-deal scenario for a six month period.  That is particularly concerning for us because very recently, at a round table discussion we had with a number of our members, some of them told us that they had these mitigation plans in place but the measures they had taken would only last for six months.  That is particularly worrying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting across Mr. McKeever, but news has just broken that the EU and UK negotiators have agreed a draft text on the Irish Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#D00100","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We will monitor progress over the next few hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#D00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>This is in spite of all respondents having actively engaged in scenario planning for at least one potential post-Brexit impact on their business, with most respondents having engaged in scenario planning for the potential reintroduction of tariffs and customs checks, the routing of in-or outbound goods or the reintroduction of Border controls.<\/p> <p>  Irish exporters, especially in the food sector and particularly for fresh and perishable goods, are heavily dependent on fast and frictionless access to the Continent via the UK landbridge as a delay in transport time could cause their goods to go off.  As a result, agriculture and food exporters continue to be extremely concerned about potential delays caused by potential customs and sanitary checks at exit and access points to Irish and UK ports.  In terms of the landbridge, this is about not only the ports on the west of the UK but also the ports into the Continent as well.  Such delays in transport times, especially for just-in-time deliveries for continental supermarkets, may have a detrimental impact in the competitiveness of the Irish agriculture, food and marine industry.  In response, a number of IEA members are actively investigating transport and shipping alternatives to the Continent, such as directly by sea.  The graph shows the measures being used to get goods off the island.  Furthermore, exporters and importers on both sides of the Irish Sea are increasingly looking at stockpiling goods to mitigate any potential impacts.  This is placing further strain on the already limited availability of warehousing space.  This is an accelerating trend as we head towards the end of the year.  There is massive demand from the industries such as the pharma sector, and increasingly the food sector, for warehousing space.  Irish companies are seeking to stockpile goods in Ireland and in the UK, and UK companies are seeking to do likewise, such that there is a massive demand on warehouse space.<\/p> <p>  On market diversification, although the UK continues to be a key market for Irish exports, since the referendum in 2016 Irish exporters have increasingly looked to diversify their export markets to reduce their over-reliance on the UK market.  In the IEA's January 2018, Export Eye, 66% of respondents stated their intention to diversify their business in the coming six months - up from 54% in June 2016.  These figures complement the figures released by the CSO on external trade for 2017, which show an increasingly outward and global looking Irish export sector.  In particular, the IEA is seeing a rising interest among members to enter and expand their business in Germany, the USA, France and Spain.  In addition, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Belgium, Italy and Sweden make up the remaining top ten diversification destinations.  What is stark from this for us is that the top ten diversification markets which are countries are looking to are all either very close or English language speaking.  In terms of providing assistance, we are asked a lot of questions about the USA and Canada.  There is massive interest in Canada.  The early indications from our survey - we have as yet only received a response from half of the respondents - is that the USA is the number one market.  Members will note from the graph the interest in other markets.  For example, the markets that are further away are a bit down the pecking order in terms of the markets which companies are looking to.  In addition, Irish exporters are increasingly shifting their focus on emerging markets in China, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of post-Brexit trade policy, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is expected to have a number of potential impacts on Ireland's international competitiveness.  This is mirrored by a general sentiment among IEA members that Brexit will have a harmful effect on the Irish economy, competitiveness and export sector.  The UK has long been a strong advocate for a liberal European trading policy.  With the UK's departure from the EU, the influence of the liberal trading countries may potentially be diminished - this is a particularly big issue - leading towards a more conservative, protectionist EU international trade policy.  In any case, the Irish Exporters Association welcomes the recently finalised free trade and investment agreements with Japan, Vietnam and Singapore, as well as those currently under negotiation by the European Union with high-potential export markets such as New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia and the Mercosur bloc.  We welcome the strong focus across all FTA agreements on reducing barriers to trade, increasing market access and supporting European businesses and regions through enforcing protected geographic indications such as Irish whiskey, Irish cream or Clare Island salmon.  We have noted that when the EU does an FTA with another country, that country appears to be much more aware and better at getting the information out and, therefore, the EU and Ireland do not get as big an advantage from it.  It may be a lack of awareness, but the EU and Ireland do not get as much as they could from the process.<\/p> <p>  The United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union also has global trading implications beyond the bilateral relationship between the EU and the UK, in particular with respect to the EU's World Trade Organisation, WTO, tariff rate quotas, TRQ, for agriculture, fish and industrial goods, in respect of which members may be aware a row has brewed up over the last couple of weeks.  In consideration of the UK's withdrawal, a revised EU TRQ schedule will have to be negotiated by the European Commission on behalf of EU member states.  In view of the need to ensure legal certainty for businesses and the continuous smooth operation of imports under the tariff rate quotas to the Union we welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s decision to proceed unilaterally to the apportionment of revised tariff rate quotas.  In particular, this will ensure that the European Union, including Ireland, continues to have a high level of quotas when trading internationally in agricultural and fisheries goods after the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  We note, however, with concern recent reports on the blocking of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s proposed draft TRQ schedules by a number of WTO members, including the United States, China, Australia and New Zealand.  Under a disorderly Brexit scenario with a default WTO trading terms by the UK, the absence of an agreed schedule may significantly impede Irish companies' ability to trade into the UK.  Therein lies the nub of the question regarding whether to revert to WTO tariffs and so on in the event of  a crash-out.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of market diversification inside and outside the European Union, overall, when investigating new markets, Irish exporters appear to show a clear preference for European Union member states and English-language countries.  With respect to the agriculture, food and fisheries sector, Ireland's close proximity to the Continent and associated short transport and shipping times are a significant factor for the popularity of the European Union as the predominant export diversification destination.  Moreover, the cost reductions achieved through the common standards, rules and regulations provided through the EU's Single Market and the absence of customs and tariffs on intra-EU trade is frequently cited as a key factor for targeting EU member states when diversifying their export markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeever and I invite Ms Maree Gallagher to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#D00500","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting the British Irish Chamber of Commerce to present to it.  I am chair of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce agrifood committee and am a food lawyer.  I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Paul Lynam, head of sectoral policy with the chamber and acts as secretariat to the committee.<br\/><br\/>The British Irish Chamber of Commerce welcomes the announcement that there has been an agreed form of wording on the Irish Border.  I look forward to hearing more detail in that regard.  The issue of the Border and cross-Border trade is of huge significant to our members in Ireland and the UK. <br\/><br\/>For the benefit of those who do not know it, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce is the only organisation representing business activities with interests across the two islands.  Our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>is to champion, protect and grow the trade between the UK and Ireland, which is worth in excess of &euro;65 billion a year and sustains more than 400,000 jobs, evenly spread across Britain and Ireland.<\/p><p>In addition to Brexit, the chamber operates across nine policy strands, including the agrifood sector, through its policy committee.  This committee is focused on maintaining and protecting the critically important UK-Ireland agrifood trade, which evidently faces a clear and present danger as a consequence of the Brexit vote.  Members of the committee include household names such as ABP, Bord Bia, Dawn Farms, Diageo, Greencore, Fyffes and Tesco.  We have a very broad membership of companies affected that are very active with the committee.  I do not need to remind members of the importance of this trade to the sector and the Irish economy as a whole or the potential damage that tariffs, non-tariff barriers or disruption to the all-island sector would cause.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine's 2017 report covers all these facts in detail.  My presentation will focus on our recent submission looking at challenges for the European Union, the current state of negotiations, responding to the Brexit challenge and the chamber's recommendations.<\/p><p> I will first turn to the challenges for the EU as we see them.  While Brexit sent an initial shockwave through the European Union, anti-EU sentiment has not spread to Ireland, as many had initially feared.  Despite the well-publicised \"Irexit\" conference last year, Ireland has maintained one of the highest ratings of satisfaction with the EU, consistently polling over 90%.  For many EU states Brexit is not the all-consuming issue it is in Ireland, with the migration crisis, the economic difficulties of some Mediterranean states, the tensions with Russia and the stand-off with Orb&aacute;n in Hungary all taking various levels of prominence across the Continent.  That said, the EU has been steadfast in its support for Ireland and the Irish backstop.  This position has been reiterated to the chamber in its numerous meetings across Europe.  It is this public show of solidarity that is reciprocated with the Irish public's support for membership of the EU.  The chamber's view has always been that Ireland's future lies in the heart of Europe while maintaining the closest possible relationship to Ireland's most important trading partner, the UK.  As a country, we do not need to define ourselves in terms of our relationship with anyone else, whether it be the UK, the US or the EU.  We must, however, remain vigilant to ensure we manage and contribute positively to these distinct and mutually beneficial relationships that we currently enjoy.  As a chamber, that is what we have been striving to do in our ongoing work across the Irish Sea with our UK members and our wider UK network.<\/p><p> I now turn to the current state of the Brexit negotiations.  As the negotiations continue, we as a chamber are extremely concerned that greater progress has not been achieved in these talks.  We had hoped for a breakthrough by the October summit of the European Council but, unfortunately, this did not materialise.  Of course, developments today may have changed this since I put together these notes, but certainly as and from this morning, an emergency summit in November is now looking unlikely, meaning that the European Council summit in December will likely be the final opportunity to secure a deal.  The chamber has consistently warned of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit and of the importance of delivering a transition period to provide adequate time for businesses to prepare for any new arrangements.  The chamber shares the view of the committee, that if an extension to Article 50 is needed to ensure a mutually beneficial agreement is reached between the UK and the EU, then the UK should request it and the EU 27 should consent to it.  A no-deal outcome would be wholly unsatisfactory to businesses, which would face the prospect of severely disrupted supply chains, new barriers to trade, and significant cost increases that will impact on growth and jobs.  While we believe that a deal preventing the UK from crashing out of the EU remains possible, we are advising our members to intensify their preparations for a no-deal scenario and providing them with the relevant information to help them to do so.<\/p><p> As for responding to the Brexit challenge, and as outlined in our submission to the committee, the chamber understands the need to diversify our markets to expand the reach of Irish agrifood products.  Many of our members already export throughout Europe and beyond and, as this committee knows, our reliance on the UK as an export market has steadily fallen to 35%.  However, we reiterate our caution that \"diversification\" cannot be seen as a panacea to Brexit.  Not only does the UK market share similar tastes with the Irish market as well as language, law and culture, but Irish companies have also invested considerable resources and time in gaining a foothold in the UK market that cannot be easily replicated in a European or external market.  Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, the UK will remain an important market for Irish agrifood exports.  Protecting Ireland's market share in the UK is therefore essential for the sector.  In this regard, the chamber wishes to acknowledge the work of State agencies in preparing for Brexit, notably for the agrifood sector.  Bord Bia has actively engaged with its clients in the sector by providing supply chain workshops, customs training and currency risk training, as well as ongoing engagement and support.  We have also found that the Bord Bia Brexit barometer has been a useful tool for the sector in gauging its preparedness for Brexit.  For the chamber's part, we held a major conference in September which brought together key stakeholders from across the sector, including the Minister, Deputy Creed; Tara McCarthy from Bord Bia; Patrick Coveney from Greencore; and Pamela Byrne, the CEO of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.  In addition, we have developed a Brexit toolkit, hosted regular briefings for our members and liaised directly with the UK authorities.  From our interactions with our agrifood members, we can inform the committee that the vast majority of the larger companies are taking the necessary steps within their power to prepare for Brexit but the lack of clarity and certainty as to what Brexit will mean still poses considerable problems for businesses, particularly smaller businesses.<\/p><p> I now turn to the chamber's recommendations.  Regardless of the preparations Irish agribusiness can make, the UK's departure from the EU will have a significant impact on the sector.  This impact will likely be catastrophic if there is a no-deal, disorderly Brexit.  Extracting the pertinent points from the chamber's policy papers, we make the following recommendations for the committee's consideration.  The Government should advocate to the European Commission for the establishment of a Brexit mitigation fund in conjunction with temporary relaxation of state aid rules in sectors and regions most acutely impacted by Brexit.  The chamber has seen at first hand the work of State agencies such as Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in not only preparing their clients for the threats associated with Brexit but also assisting them to identify new opportunities that have been emerging.  To its credit, since the Brexit referendum result, the Government has broadly increased the budgets of State agencies in addition to Brexit-specific initiatives.  This must be maintained.  In addition, Government supports should be simplified.  The Government should work with business representative organisations, such as the chamber and the Irish Exporters Association, to review the grant process from application phase to reimbursement.  State supports should also be open to all businesses exposed to the UK market, and the business and stakeholder organisations should be fully mobilised to ensure that businesses are aware of their eligibility for support.  We also recommend that export certificates for agrifood exporters be simplified.  As it stands, the export system administered by the HSE for food products of non-animal origin is inefficient and is frustrating exporters, which is leading to delays in exports.  This is particularly relevant for agrifood exporters seeking new market access.  A more streamlined system should be put in place to ensure that exporters are fully supported in their endeavours and not hindered by red tape.  We have also recommended the introduction of a customs voucher scheme.  To alleviate the burden I have described, the Government should introduce a simplified customs voucher scheme offering up to &euro;5,000 in support to Irish companies that export to and import from the UK and which will be working with customs procedures possibly for the first time.  We also recommend an increase in support for the regulatory enforcement agencies in Ireland, specifically the FSAI.  Ireland's official controls of food will be under increased scrutiny and severely stretched in a post-Brexit world, regardless of the type of Brexit.  Ensuring we have a robust, independent regulator capable of monitoring the safety, quality and origin of food produced in Ireland, food destined for export and, more importantly, imported food will be key to Ireland's future ability to market itself as the food island.<\/p><p>The chamber lobbied for the introduction for a loan scheme similar to the future growth loan scheme and therefore we welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s announcement in budget 2019.  Members believe that the interest rate applied should be 2.95%, the rate applied to the previous agribusiness loan scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maree Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gallagher.

We might get some clarity today about the Border issue.  Like the witnesses, I am also waiting for the detail and when we have that we will be better informed.  As a business community, how prepared are we for what Brexit could bring?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has had four major events around the country in the last month and significant interaction with the business community.  Many stakeholders were involved and they have been very well attended.  Do the witnesses feel that the business community has interacted sufficiently and worked with their own businesses on the issues?  There was reference to the &euro;300 million in Brexit loans.  Has there been engagement with the business community on the loan itself?  Has it engaged with the process and brought forward proposals in order that companies can draw down that funding?  Has the UK put in place financial supports or programmes to inform businesses and society that are similar to what has been put in place in Ireland in the past six or eight months?  My view might be partial but while I have seen some interaction with business here, I have not seen it on the other side of the water.  While a text has been somewhat agreed today, the political issues must still be played through in Westminster, which probably will be more problematic than the text itself.  How prepared are our neighbours for a hard border?  Are they ready, have they engaged and do they have the information and loans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#F00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>As Senator Lombard remarked, there seems to be some good news but it only a text.  We have not seen it yet but as events have evolved, we all know the problem probably will be one of getting it through on the British side.  There has been total disarray in the negotiations at the top level.  Has this been portrayed down through the channels to the small and medium-sized enterprises and export companies?  Ireland has at least had a discussion around preparedness.  Every company many not have acted on the advice it was given but we have had the conversation.  Have they even done this?  Are there many companies on which Irish companies depend, for raw materials or products, for instance, which are in denial?  If whatever has been agreed today is not accepted on the UK side and there is a hard Brexit, are there Irish companies that will find themselves in a precarious position but which are not aware of that, because some of their inputs come from or through the UK?<\/p> <p>  Are the witnesses aware of contingency plans on the Continent, in companies that export to Ireland but which use the landbridge?  Have we explored or are we looking at potential positives from this process?  While the negatives far outweigh any positive developments, even with tariffs are there products where we might prove more competitive than a fellow EU country which not only has the tariff but also must transport goods further to the UK than we do?  For instance, there might be someone transporting goods from the bottom of Italy to the UK.  Might we possibly have a new market in that scenario, where we would become competitive once transport costs and tariffs are considered?  <\/p> <p>  It is right to plan and we must plan for the worst and hope for the best.

Will there be a situation whereby products coming from Ireland will not have to undergo any checks but can fly through regardless?  Have there been negotiations on this?  <\/p><p>As my colleague noted, people in Britain will have to eat.  There will be many other products they have previously imported from Ireland and which heretofore they have not been getting from elsewhere.  This committee has heard from Bord Bia and from Ministers who have been on trade missions all over the world.  On foot of our efforts to export to other countries and do deals with them, we know it takes considerable time and is not something that happens in an instant.  Do we have information on what Britain is doing in this area?  Is the British Government actively trying to do these deals?  Have they done many or any of them?  Have they even started?  Does that leave us in a position where there are products they are currently getting from Ireland that they will no longer require from us, regardless of whatever deal or no-deal takes place?  Either way, we will have to move on with it. <\/p><p>On the proposed Brexit mitigation fund and a relaxation of state aid rules, most of us would concur that we need something like this to happen.  It has been acknowledged for some time that something will have to be done in this regard.  I expect that people are waiting to see the outcome of the negotiations and when we know what the impact will be, such measures can be put in place.  However, clearly, that fund will have to come from Europe.

As a British politician said some months ago, there are more roads between Monaghan and Armagh than there are between Sweden and Norway.  That simple reality must be faced at some point.  I ask the witnesses if their colleagues in the UK are aware that this is an impossible circle to square?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#F00500","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>We will start with Mr. McKeever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#G00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>There is one overall backstop, according RT&Eacute;'s correspondent in Brussels, a UK-wide customs arrangement with deeper provisions for Northern Ireland customs and regulations, with a review mechanism included.  I gather that Ms Theresa May is calling her Cabinet in tomorrow morning to agree on that.  We will see how that goes in terms of making its way through the House of Commons.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Senator Lombard's question about our level of preparedness.  When I speak to people from the UK and to officials who come over here, they are astonished by the four Brexit events hosted by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and by the fact that the Government has taken the time and made the effort to bring people together to spell out, as far as possible, the potential impact of Brexit.  It is probably easier to do that in a country like Ireland than it would be in the UK.  However, my sense of it is that we have been preparing for a deal rather than for a no-deal scenario.  As a country we do not have a plan B in place in the event of a British crash out, and I am very worried about that.  A lot of work has been done on raising awareness but we have not begun to look at how we might help people to deal with practical things like the customs implications, for example.  I will deal with the related question about the threat of additional costs arising from that in due course.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the level of preparedness of our members, we have seen three or four things going on since the vote.  In the immediate run-up to the vote and just after it, the focus was on currency and currency management.  That persisted until around February last year, at which point we began to get a lot of queries on how to deal with customs.  Customs has been the predominant issue for us.  We provide training courses on customs, the authorised economic operator, AEO, and so on.  We put on a course in August and thought that it might not be filled but it was four times oversubscribed.  We ended up having to run a number of additional courses in September.  There is considerable demand for information on customs at the moment.  Interest this year has mainly been in market diversification and how companies can get into other markets, although concern about currency has crept back into the equation recently.  In a recent survey, we asked our members the point at which their margin disappears in the UK.  Specifically we asked them at what rate the euro-sterling exchange rate impacts their company's margin in the UK, and around 42% said between 90 and 95, which is not very far above the rate at the moment.  Another 30% said between 95 and 1, which is quite worrying.<\/p> <p>  Anecdotal evidence on the preparedness of our members suggests that the bigger companies are better prepared.  The foreign-owned, large multinational companies are far more prepared than the Irish-owned large companies, which in turn are more prepared than the medium-sized and smaller companies, and so on.  Companies are less and less prepared in direct proportion to their size.  There is a high level of awareness of Brexit and its implications, but many of the smaller companies are time poor and are unable to deal with it while the larger, globalised companies can put a team together to address it.  We asked our members who was responsible for Brexit in their organisation and found that a lot of companies have Brexit teams in place.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked if the business community is engaging on Brexit.  We are seeing increasing engagement all of the time.  The four Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events, for example, were very well received by our members.  To my knowledge, the UK is not doing the same thing.  On the relative readiness of the UK, I do not think they are very ready at all.  I was speaking at a conference on food, agriculture and farming in London last week and was quite shocked by what I saw and heard.  The conference was attended by some very senior retailers and producers and involved a panel of four or five speakers, most of whom spoke for 40 minutes.  My abiding sense, having listened to them speak, was one of &ldquo;keep calm and carry on&rdquo;.  There was a sense that they knew they were heading towards the cliff like lemmings but that they would prevail somehow and deal with it.  I was quite shocked by that.  I got a sense from the farming community over there, having listened to various speakers, that it is less bothered about Brexit than others.  Farmers believe that when they pull out of CAP, the UK Government will provide subvention, they will be able to farm in whatever way they want, and because they are going to do fabulous trade deals with countries all over the world, they will be able to sell food to markets all over the world.  They were not prepared to ask questions about cheap food policy and what it will do to undermine standards and so on.  In no way, shape or form, when one looks at regulatory equivalence, are environmental or labour standards being included in the conversation.  The farming representatives attending that conference were talking about a massive labour shortage in the fields in the context of getting stuff out of the ground.<\/p> <p>  As to whether there are any potential positives from Brexit, I see very little except perhaps that it is forcing Irish companies to look further afield, if they can, and to diversify their markets.  I do not see any positives on a national economic level really, although there is some evidence that Brexit is making Ireland a much more attractive country in which to locate in terms of retaining access to the European Union.<\/p> <p>  We have done a lot of work in creating an awareness of Brexit but our action has been focused on a deal and not on a crash-out.  I think that despite what has been agreed, there is still a grave danger of a crash out.<\/p> <p>  Senator Daly asked if there is disarray in the UK among SMEs.  I have referred already to what I heard in London last week.  When I spoke to some of the companies, I found that they were very divided.  There are very few business leaders in the UK who will stand up and say what they believe.  There is a lack of leadership within business in the UK in terms of talking to the Government and trying to influence policy.  People seem to be terrified to open their mouths.  Very few companies got involved in the Brexit referendum debate.  I am not aware of any national preparedness events akin to what is happening here but representatives from the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce might have more information on that.<\/p> <p>  The sourcing of raw materials is a big issue for Irish companies and not just in the context of tariffs or delays caused by additional customs procedures but also in the context of import VAT.  Once the UK becomes a third country, VAT of 23% will be imposed on goods coming from the UK at the point of entry.<\/p><p>There are deferrals in operation at present.  Revenue will give a deferral to the 15th day of the following month.  If a company brings its goods in on the 16th day of the month, it gets 29 days or 30 days but if it brings them in on the 14th day of the month, it gets a day.  Other countries in the European Union, such as Greece, have managed to get a delay of up to three months.  There is no reason why we, as a nation, should not be looking to do that.  It means it will affect the Government's cashflow but it will help the cashflow of companies.  We should think of the number of small companies whose margin or cashflow could potentially be wiped out.  Look at what happened to the mushroom farmers.  There was a 23% hit to their bottom line immediately.  It will have a massive impact.<\/p><p> Anecdotally we are hearing stories about some European companies telling their suppliers they need to start looking at where they are buying their stuff from and that perhaps Ireland and the UK are not the best places to be getting it from.  We are hearing that anecdotally.  A set of EU contingency plans were published by the EU today, details of which are just starting to work out.  What happens when we go off a cliff edge?  Will bollards come up on the Border?  I do not think so.  Unless there is time to put infrastructure in place, I assume trade will continue until all the stops and checks can be put in place.  Will there be a dramatic stop to everything overnight?  I am not quite sure the infrastructure is there, either in terms of physical infrastructure or personnel, to be able to do that.  There is much talk about the Prime Minister in the UK saying the UK will not put border infrastructure up.  Many people have said the Taoiseach said exactly the same thing.  There will be no physical border.  If there is no border between Ireland and Great Britain, does that mean the border moves to the coast of France?  If the European Union is going to preserve the integrity of the Single Market, it will not want cheap food and unregulated stuff coming into the European Union via Northern Ireland.  Where does the border end up being?  Is it in France?  In terms of whether it is a cliff edge, I do not know what will happen in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Mr. McKeever mentioned that some European countries are already advising companies to start sourcing elsewhere other than the UK and Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#H00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>No, what I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>He grouped Ireland with the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#H00400","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Is that because of the landbridge?

On the landbridge, approved economic operator, AEO, status will be able to help a lot of transport on and off.  We are not 100% sure about the food sector because our sense is for livestock and animal product, the truck will be opened and will have to be opened.  The jury is out on that.  The AEO will help with other matters in terms of bonding and paying money across.  Will it be the solution?  There are a number of issues with the AEO model, one of them being with regard to groupage.  If the foodstuff is in the same truck as other bits and pieces, it may have a knock-on effect on other goods going back and forth across the Border.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about whether there is a model for no checks.  I am not aware of such a model.  There is talk that a truck would be sealed somewhere in Ireland and reopened so there are issues around security.  There is talk that the truck could start in Ireland, route through the UK and be opened in France.  The AEO model is most effective when the whole supply chain end-to-end has AEO accreditation and certification.  <\/p> <p>  Customs declarations were referred to.  There has not been a need to have customs declarations since Ireland went into the European Union so that expertise is largely gone out of the country.  Companies that are trading with other parts of the world outside the EU have that knowledge but the demand for basic customs courses is going through the roof.  Initially, people who were supply chain professionals were coming to the courses but finance managers of companies are beginning to come to them.  In 2016, there were 1.3 million customs declarations on and off the island.  About 700,000 were import-related and 630,000 were export-related.  It is expected to increase tenfold.  There is technology available to help with it but there is a very low level of expertise and people with such expertise are highly sought after at present.  Many of our members tell us they are actively trying to recruit such people.  At the same time, the Revenue Commissioners is trying to recruit such people.  It is exactly the same in the UK.  We will not be able to take them from there and they will not be able to take them from here. There is a massive demand for that expertise at present.  Companies are actively engaged in contingency planning around that.  The question is whether they employ one or two experts and try to train a number of people internally or whether they buy in the expertise.  If we were not talking about Brexit, we would be talking about the major competitive issues that already exist in the economy but this is an additional piece.  There will be costs in terms of employing people and potential time delays.  Those people will become very expensive over time.  It is a big issue.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the question on the UK and delays, our friends in the British Irish Chamber of Commerce might have more of a view on this.  My sense is there have been some initial conversations and the one that seems to be the Holy Grail for them is a trade deal with the United States.  At the conference I attended last week, I heard the trade deal that companies want to have is with their biggest trading partner outside the European Union.  It is being held out as the Holy Grail.  If one listens to what is coming out of the White House, it seems to be keen to do a trade deal with the EU and the UK.  It seems to have moved on a bit.  I think it will be a lot more difficult for them to do trade deals than they might believe it is.  There is very little awareness of the fact that it will be much more difficult for them to do such trade deals.  The UK's trading pattern is not awfully dissimilar to ours in that the EU is their biggest trading partner.  It is nonsense to jeopardise that in order to replace it with trade coming out of the Commonwealth countries.  I do not want to name names but at the conference I attended last week, I sat in the room and listened to fake news.  Somebody who was billed as a learned individual got up and spoke about a specific issue but it was just untrue.  I sat in the room with these captains of industry.  The stuff that is going on is astonishing.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to Brexit mitigation and state aid, I am not aware of any application for state aid around a worst-case scenario deal.  I am not aware of any of that but I am absolutely certain companies will need assistance.  I mentioned that as recently as last week, we were told by three of our members that the measures they put in place will run out after six months.  They are reasonably sized companies and that is the breathing space they have bought themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>There probably will be a certain amount of crossover with Mr. McKeever's answers.  I will start with Deputy Martin Kenny's questions and work the other way around the room for a bit of diversity.<br\/><br\/>On the landbridge model, the Deputy asked whether food and other product could go from Ireland straight through Britain to the Continent without checks.  There have been attempts to investigate if that could happen.  The problem is that at the moment we already have checks.  Sanitary and phytosanitary checks particularly for food of animal origin already exist.  In the context of the Single Market rules that are in place, it would be very difficult to allow product to leave Ireland and cross the landbridge without any checks.  That is hard to conceive at the moment.<br\/><br\/>That said, I am aware that in the pharmaceutical area where it is necessary to have batch release and a qualified person who releases the product, there is some talk that in that area, product could be released in Europe to come via the landbridge into Ireland and provided it does not stop and nothing happens to it in the course of that, it would not need to be further released from the UK into Ireland.<br\/><br\/>These issues are being addressed in an attempt to find a way of facilitating trade without putting unnecessary barriers in the way.  I believe it would be very difficult to end up with no checks mainly for the reasons Mr. McKeever already stated particularly with cross-Border trade.  As Deputy Martin Kenny is based in Leitrim, he is very familiar with that.<br\/><br\/>The real risk is with any form of cheap-food policy in the UK, if the UK looks to do trade deals with South American countries such as Brazil and Argentina or indeed with the USA, which has very different quality and safety standards from those in the EU.  At the moment product moving within the EU is already subject to checks but they are reasonably limited.  With a border and potentially product coming into the UK, checks will be required and it is just a matter of where they take place.  One of the reasons for such checks will be the maintenance of Single Market rules on food safety, quality and standards.<br\/><br\/>Our members would love trade to continue exactly as it is.  They have been looking for maintenance of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  If the news today delivers that, it will be fantastic and very welcome.  Based on how things have been going, it seems that trade without checks will potentially be an issue.<br\/><br\/>As we know the UK is not self-sufficient in food production; it produces 60% and relies on 40% of imports, a significant amount of which comes from Ireland.  That is likely to continue and our members certainly want it to continue.  As part of some of these trade deals, however, the UK will need to consider giving concessions to other countries.  Usually in concluding trade deals it comes down to an issue with the cows - either meat or dairy.  If the UK wants to do a trade deal with the US, it is likely that the US will push for increased exports of beef and other products as part of that.  As we know, there are issues in Europe with US hormone-fed beef and chlorinated chickens.  These are real issues and have been impediments to the EU doing trade deals with the US in the past.  If the UK is adamant that it wants to go out and do these trade deals, there will be issues relating to food.  The potential weakness lies with food coming into the UK, which then could potentially get on to the European market.<br\/><br\/>The customs voucher scheme we have recommended is exactly as Mr. McKeever said.  The vast majority of Irish companies have not had to consider customs for the past 40 years.  It is not that it is rocket science; it is that it is a timely, paper-filling administrative burden.  For an organisation, whose margins are tight and already has an enormous amount of paperwork to deal with, this is an added burden and will challenge most companies other than the very large ones.<br\/><br\/>We need to provide support to all companies to bring them up to speed on what will be required.  The courses run by the IEA have been very well attended.  We have also run Brexit courses and seminars.  We are aware that the State agencies are doing as much work as possible.  We will need people who understand the system and can figure that out where products are going and the potential tariff to be applied.  That will lead to increased costs.  Earlier I referred to qualified persons, QPs, in the pharmaceutical sector.  Ireland now has a shortage of qualified persons who are suitably qualified.  As a result the wages they can command are increasing.  As Mr. McKeever has said, I suspect that will become an issue with customs and that skill.  We really need to focus on ensuring those skills exist throughout the chain.<br\/><br\/>I think that covers most of the questions Deputy Martin Kenny raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Maree Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I have one query.

If we have tariffs post Brexit, there will be particular tariffs on each individual ingredient.

We have considered whether there is a locally-based way to provide a service for some of the logistics companies.  The production runs, export products and compliance requirements of companies differ.  Our training informs exporters of what one should put in each box because that is what they need to know.  Although there are customs brokers and similar services, if supports were made available, companies could take on such tasks.  The service could be farmed out, but, at a minimum, somebody in the organisation needs to know it.

Several of our larger members have the resources to look at their supply chain and identify from where their raw materials are coming.  They have done so and perhaps considered alternative sources or the cost implications of continuing with their current suppliers.  Since the beginning of September, people have been gearing up in examining and considering their supply chain.  There is no doubt that there will be issues regarding the supply chain and raw material supplied from the United Kingdom to Irish manufacturers.  Some are seeking alternative supplies in Ireland and on the Continent, but our concern is that it could lead to increased costs.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about contingency plans on the Continent and referred to contingency planning here.  The Government, businesses and business organisations have been doing a lot of work to prepare companies and inform them of the potential challenges.  Some contingency plans have been made on the Continent, but other issues are of more concern there and focused on more.  Brexit is not as much of a concern there because the United Kingdom is not as significant a market for continental businesses as it is for Irish firms.  However, in recent weeks, as we get closer to the Brexit end game, there has been more of a focus on how it may affect continental markets.  Mr. McKeever has referred to anecdotal evidence that companies on the Continent are considering where they source their ingredients.  There is no doubt that companies on the Continent will be looking for opportunities to become more competitive and may choose to source locally rather than from Ireland or the United Kingdom.  Bord Bia and other agencies are doing much work to ensure there is a clear distinction between Irish and UK product.  Contingency planning on the Continent for Brexit, particularly in the agrifood area, is significantly behind ours.  It is being considered and firms are aware of it, but they are not as prepared as we are.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly referred to opportunities arising from Brexit.  We would love to say there will be many opportunities.  Although there are opportunities, they are not very obvious.  The Senator asked whether our proximity and lower transport costs to the United Kingdom would give Irish firms exporting to the United Kingdom or British firms selling into Ireland a slight competitive advantage over other EU producers, even in a scenario where tariffs were imposed.  We consider the area of innovation to offer the most opportunities to make Irish industry more competitive.  I will address its state of readiness and preparedness, but there is no doubt that the United Kingdom is considering how it will become competitive on the global stage post-Brexit.  Papers on attracting investment in biopharma and innovative food products and food supplements and such areas have been produced there.  Firms in the United Kingdom will consider how to become competitive.  We have anecdotal evidence that the idea that British firms will be able to shed the regulatory chains of the European Union and throw the rulebook out the window is being considered behind closed doors.  Ireland and Irish companies need to look at that issue and be in a position to compete and use our proximity to the United Kingdom.  Although Brexit is considered to be a negative development, we need to see where the opportunities are because we are going to be feeding our friends and neighbours in the United Kingdom.  That is what we want to do.  There is no doubt that we will be reliant on imports from the United Kingdom.  Our members hope to have as close a relationship as possible with the United Kingdom post-Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard asked whether the United Kingdom was as prepared as we were.  Mr. McKeever referenced the conference he addressed last week.  Our sense is that the British Government has not done as much work as the Irish Government in planning for Brexit and a potential no deal Brexit.<\/p><p> I will ask Mr. Lynam to speak a little about the loan and the Government supports.  In terms of a business scenario, while we have been discussing Brexit and supply chain issues with members of our agrifood committee for the past two years or so, and also what we should be saying to this committee and to the Government in the context of how we can support the trade, we have seen, perhaps, less engagement on the UK side and less awareness of some of the issues.  However, that has changed in recent weeks.  I spoke to one of our members this morning who informed me that his big customers in the UK have suddenly begun to send questionnaires asking what his plans are and how he proposes to deal with tariffs and ensure that he can continue to supply them.  That has not happened within the food sector until the very recent past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maree Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Is it the case that the penny is only beginning to drop?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#L00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542123000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I think so.  The approach has been that it will be all right and that matters will resolve themselves.  However, as we get closer to the end of this process, it appears that the big retail customers in the UK are suddenly realising that they need to think about the situation and that perhaps it will not be okay.  There is more engagement between trading partners than has been the case previously.  In my day job, I have seen that in the pharma and other sectors which began their processes a lot earlier than the food sector.  The food companies and the retailers in the UK appear to be becoming more engaged with the process.  I do not think their level of preparedness is anywhere near where we are and there has been an approach that it will all work out, that everything will be find and that it will be all right on the night.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lynam, our head of sectoral policy, spends a considerable amount of time in the UK and engaging with the UK Government and with businesses.

First, in response to the original question, the stakeholder engagement has been exceptional, from the regular stakeholder engagement the T&aacute;naiste has to the customs' consultative forum to the sector-by-sector Brexit stakeholder forums that took place after the referendum and even the preparation in advance of Brexit when the UK Government did not engage in any preparation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the supports the Government has made available, while there are quite a lot of them, I think they could be better and more wide ranging.  Our competitiveness as a business community generally could be improved more.  I do not think we have got the full breadth of support in terms of the budget in that regard.  There has been a low take-up of the preparing for Brexit grants.  They are limited to Enterprise Ireland clients and they would need to be more wide-ranging to assist the totality of businesses exporting and affected by Brexit.  We have articulated the need for a customs voucher scheme to support businesses such as those that go to the Irish Exporters Association for customs training.  That is now essential rather than important.<\/p> <p>  That said, the difference between the Irish preparation and the UK preparation is like the difference between day and night.  The UK did not do any preparation or scenario planning in advance of Brexit.  The most information it has put out is the no-deal papers.  The information it gives to businesses is based on the perception that Brexit is a good thing.  We do not have that in political discourse in Ireland.  There is not any political party that thinks, generally speaking, Brexit is a good thing and therefore we have prepared for Brexit as a bad thing.  It is very difficult for the UK Government to propose supports for something they think is genuinely going to be positive.  That is not uniform across the United Kingdom, because it is devolved confidence.  The Scottish and Welsh Administrations have given some support and information to their members but there has been practically nothing from the UK Government because it is based on a scenario that it thinks will be positive overall.<\/p> <p>  Authorised economic operators status does quite a lot but, as Mr. McKeever articulated, it does not fully support the agrifood sector.  It is important to bear in mind that obtaining such status is not too long a process but it is expensive because of the detail that has to go into it in terms of the supply chain.<\/p> <p>  On the work we have done already, we set up a ports and transit group between the UK and Irish ports and the transit and freight sectors in terms of the knock-on effect that them not being prepared would have on Irish businesses that are prepared as best they can.  Again, there are significant differences.  While the UK is only now looking at different scenarios of what Brexit may potentially mean, the Irish port and transit sector is taking action.  The agricultural post has been established at Rosslare Europort to look at diversification there and to create different space for checks that eventually will happen if the UK leaves the Single Market.  That is not happening on the UK side of things.  It has no plan for Dover at all.  The UK is looking at how it can rearrange some of its landing sections in some ports but it is not taking it to the next level at all.  The timeline is very tight for it to implement anything into the next stage as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018111300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lynam"},{"type":"speech","time":1542123000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Lynam have much interaction with the companies that are not in that space at the moment?

Our next event is in January, when we will bring together the ports and transit sectors when we will have a clearer idea of the potential Brexit at which we are looking.<\/p> <p>  UK deals were mentioned.  While it is in the EU customs union, the UK cannot legally sign any deals.  It can sign deals when it enters the transition period but such deals cannot be implemented until after that period.  From what we have heard, the UK has not had the response it was hoping for in terms of countries such as India and Australia.  The response from America has been well publicised.  The UK was hoping for more progress with India and Australia as well but that has not happened.  The Brexiteers are saying it is incredibly unlikely that the UK will have any of the international trade deals if it keeps the common EU rule book.  Wilbur Ross has stated that America is good to its friends.  America wants to do a trade deal with the United Kingdom but it will be on its terms.  If the deal is on American terms, that will affect the regulations and rules the UK will implement.  This, in turn, will affect the UK's relationship with the European Union, particularly Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We do not envisage applying for or establishing a mitigation fund now but we do think it is something that should happen with immediate effect post Brexit, regardless of the type of Brexit that will happen.  Brexit will be a shock to the European Union as a whole and it should not be just one or two countries seeking for state aid, it should be a general EU-wide response.  The European Committee of the Regions, which involves local authorities, has recommended a regional support Brexit mitigation fund.  We believe that is a good step in the right direction but it should be done on a sectoral basis as well.  Irish agrifood will possibly be the most exposed of any sector in the European Union but other sectors in other countries as well should also receive EU solidarity funding.  It could be structured in the same way as the Structural Funds.

Bord na M&oacute;na has been the focus of a large amount of public comment in recent weeks and it is timely and appropriate that we assist in the national response regarding climate action and outline our decarbonising plans.<\/p> <p>  When it was founded, Bord na M&oacute;na was given a mandate to support Ireland's energy security and employment in the midlands.  The mandate to support employment is as important to us now as it was then.  For Bord na M&oacute;na decarbonisation presents a serious challenge and a considerable opportunity.  It means moving away from peat and into renewables, resource recovery and new businesses that all support key national policies.<\/p><p>We are keenly aware of the effect this transition is having on our people who are the group most affected by decarbonisation.  <\/p><p> The company&rsquo;s plan involves three parts.  The first part involves consolidating and simplifying our business structures so we can decarbonise and reposition Bord na M&oacute;na.  The second part involves accelerating plans and development of our renewable energy and resource recovery businesses.  The third is the development of new sustainable businesses to support significant employment.  <\/p><p> The first part of the plan is aimed at providing a new structure that takes account of the need to decarbonise the business and deliver a new Bord na M&oacute;na.  The new structure safeguards the maximum number of jobs and facilitates the decarbonisation strategy.  As the committee is aware, decarbonising our business has meant us confronting some extremely difficult choices.  On 24 October, we announced that fewer people will be working in our peat operations and also in our managerial and administrative roles across Bord na M&oacute;na.  We also announced that we would open a voluntary redundancy programme, with the expectation that these changes could directly impact approximately 380 to 430 roles and employees.  It was not an easy decision to make.  We have taken these steps to allow us to decarbonise and at the same time save the company so it will continue to be a vehicle for economic growth in the midlands, a role that is very important given the challenging socioeconomic profile of the region.  Doing this will enable us to implement national policy, including the achievement of climate action policy. <\/p><p> I have met with employees and spoken at 11 town hall meetings in the past few weeks and believe the decision is supported by the vast number of our workforce.  A consultation process that includes the group of unions is under way.  We have recently advertised new roles internally to implement the new structure and have received a high level of interest in them.  In addition, we have a range of retraining and reskilling opportunities that we will be making available to our employees who are affected by the process.  Part of that is outlined in the appendix we have shared with the committee.  I am confident we will meet the challenges of decarbonisation in a fair and measured way.  It is all part of a managed transition out of peat and acceleration into renewable energy, resource recovery and low carbon sustainable business.  This managed transition is in line with key aspects of national policy.<\/p><p> A managed transition is in line with the national planning framework, which outlines the Government&rsquo;s high-level strategic plan for shaping the future growth and development of the country out to 2040.  A managed transition is also in line with the Citizens' Assembly proposals, where 97% of the members recommended that the State should end all subsidies for peat extraction and instead spend that money on peat bog restoration.  The assembly also said there should be proper provision for the protection of the rights of the workers impacted with a majority of 61% recommending the State should end all subsidies on a phased basis over five years.  The PSO subsidies for peat-fired generation ended three years ago in the case of Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Edenderry power station and will cease completely in the ESB stations next year.  The company notes there have been many calls for similar funds to support the transition in line with this Citizens' Assembly recommendation.  <\/p><p> As the committee is aware Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Edenderry power station has been co-fired with biomass for a number of years, 70% of which is sourced in Ireland.  Co-firing with biomass which is renewable, greenhouse gas neutral and sustainably sourced makes Edenderry power station one of the largest single providers of renewable energy on the island of Ireland.  We expect that the future requirement for biomass will grow from over 400,000 energy tonnes this year to in excess of 1.3 million energy tonnes per annum from around 2020 to 2021.  Of our current supply, 70% is sourced in Ireland and our preference at all times is to source Irish biomass materials.  As supplies of Irish biomass are currently limited, we are working to develop sustainable imports and indigenous supply chains to meet this increasing demand.<\/p><p> A key part of the managed transition will take place during the next 12 months when we begin to reduce the supply of peat and begin supplying biomass to ESB's two midlands based power stations.  This will have the immediate effect of significantly cutting the carbon emissions from these stations.  This part of the transition is subject to ESB successfully progressing planning applications for their west Offaly and Lough Ree power stations which are to be submitted shortly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Longford County Council.  The end of this transition period will occur in 2027 to 2028 where the intention is for stations to run on 100% biomass.  The three stations running on biomass will then potentially provide 346 megawatts of dispatchable renewable power to the Irish grid.<\/p><p> The progressive replacement of peat with biomass will allow for those affected by the current plan to be treated in a fair and just manner.  The transition is a relatively short period of time and will allow for a significant number of people to retire in that time or in cases allow them to avail of replacement employment opportunities within the company, where it becomes available, or retrain and reskill for alternative employment outside the company.  It will also allow the company to build out the new sustainable businesses that we intend to become a new foundation stone for employment and communities in the midlands.    <\/p><p> In terms of reductions in the amount of carbon, the results of this managed transition will be very significant.  From a baseline of peat emissions of 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2015, Bord na M&oacute;na estimates it will reduce its peat product emissions to 1.8 million tonnes in 2020.  That is a reduction of 40% in CO2 emissions by 2020 alone.  <\/p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na has made considerable progress in decarbonising its electricity, with the carbon intensity falling from 1.1 tonnes of CO2 per MWh in 2007 to 0.5 tonnes today and is likely to fall to 0.16 tonnes by 2025.  Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s renewable electricity is currently produced at Drehid landfill gas, Mountlucas wind farm, Bruckana wind farm, Sliabh Bawn joint venture wind farm and the country&rsquo;s first ever wind farm Bellacorick in County Mayo and at Edenderry using biomass.  The power generation business is a key driver of the group strategy to transition to a sustainable future, with well over 60% of electricity generated currently classified as renewable.  As we accelerate decarbonisation we will build on this solid platform helping us to meet our objective of becoming a leading generator of renewable energy as we expand development across our land bank.  Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Edenderry power station performs a uniquely important role as a large-scale generator of dispatchable renewable power to the grid at a time of increased intermittency of generation on the Irish grid system.  It is important for the committee to note the role that biomass will play in delivering dispatchable renewable power in the coming years.  Bord na M&oacute;na is also in the process of developing the 172 MW Oweninny wind farm in north Mayo through a joint venture with ESB which will become operational in 2019.  Procurement for another wind farm at Cloncreen in Offaly is also progressing.  We are also developing solar farms in partnership with the ESB and have accelerated our plans for renewable energy development during the company&rsquo;s transition phase.  This will involve the development of up to 2 GW of generating assets by 2030.  Investments in this area will support the creation of considerable numbers of long-term jobs as well as providing construction jobs during the build-out programme.  Perhaps even more importantly the development of these renewable assets will help support other key parts of our transition journey, especially in areas that will generate more significant employment opportunities in the midlands.  We have also invested significantly in engaging people and communities near renewable energy developments.  This is consistent with our values and traditions as a company and it has had a very positive effect in how these proposals are received and perceived during the planning, development and operational stages.   <\/p><p> Alongside the development of renewable energy supply, we are also increasingly active in the provision of virtual power plant services and demand side management.  To do this Bord na M&oacute;na has acquired a 50% interest in a start-up company called Electricity Exchange, which focuses on the development of smart technology and the provision of flexible support services to the national grid.  This business supports high-tech Irish jobs and recently announced ambitious plans to expand in the future.<\/p><p> Energy efficiency will also be at the centre of a transition to a clean, low-carbon energy system by 2050.  In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s EU and national commitments and wider climate change goals, Bord na M&oacute;na, as a commercial semi-State, has worked towards achieving the 33% national target.<\/p><p> Our resource recovery business is a key pillar in Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s strategy helping the company diversify away from high-carbon activities while also supporting national waste policy.  Bord na M&oacute;na is also involved in the waste-to-energy sphere such as the landfill gas utilisation plant at Drehid which generates around 38,000 MWh of renewable energy per annum.  We also have acquired the end-of-life tyre collection and processing service, Ireland&rsquo;s only recycling operation which ensures complete destruction of car tyres and 98% recovery of material for recycling use.  In addition, significant investment is being made in recovery technologies in the area of plastic recycling.  <\/p><p> These existing resource recovery activities already support in excess of 300 jobs within Bord na M&oacute;na with an additional 50 being created at our tyre recycling facility in Donore Road in Drogheda.  Investment in the recovery of higher value material and resources will help deliver on key national sustainability and waste objectives but also help support replacement employment in the midlands.<\/p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na is keenly conscious of how important it is for the company to go from a brown to green strategy and for it to succeed.  This has been a feature of much of the public commentary of our decision to decarbonise.  Bord na M&oacute;na and our employees are setting out on a very challenging journey.  We are aware we will be a significant test case for public perceptions around climate action.  If after we are finished our transition is perceived as a success that benefited people nationally, then the national task of decarbonisation will be made immeasurably easier.  If, however, climate action is perceived as an entirely negative process, that is a burden borne only by employees of companies like Bord na M&oacute;na and by already disadvantaged midlands communities, then the national strategy would be needlessly undermined.  This consideration is a key driver of our plans.  As a company we know we have to accelerate plans and demonstrate the real benefits that will accrue as we move to new low carbon businesses. <\/p><p> These new business plans include projects that tap into our land assets and the skills of our workforce.  We have identified two areas of intent for new businesses; the first involving fresh water aquaculture and the second involving the supply of herbal remedies to the pharma and cosmetics sectors.  Our aquaculture project is already being piloted at a closed loop, fresh water fish farm located on one of our bogs in east Offaly that we are progressing with Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  We are looking to progress this and our herbal business project to business cases in the next 12 to 18  months.  Thereafter, we will hopefully be developing these as commercial ventures of scale.   <\/p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na is also examining opportunities to develop the infrastructure and alternative fuel sources required for electric and other low emissions vehicles.  While heavy goods vehicles account for only 3% of the total vehicles in Ireland they consume 20% of the energy used within this fleet.  Compressed natural gas has high potential to decarbonise heavy goods vehicles due to the challenges associated with their full electrification.  To do this the company is developing an anaerobic digestion and biomethane injection project in C&uacute;il na M&oacute;na in County Laois which will contribute to the decarbonisation of the gas network.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also identified potential rapid recharging sites for vehicles within its landbank and is assessing their suitability. <\/p><p> All of these investments in this area also support the company&rsquo;s objective of developing new midlands-based employment that is sustainable and supports a low-carbon economy.  We are at any early stage of the development but we estimate that these projects carry with them the potential to grow Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s employment base by approximately 500 people.  This will be achieved in a way that supports a low carbon economy generally and that can support economic development across the communities with which we are so strongly associated.  I am encouraged by all the support that has been flagged on this and if it is delivered, I believe we can help ensure that the midlands is a big winner out of decarbonisation, a winner in terms of investment, cleaner air, water, better amenities and better employment opportunities.  <\/p><p> Potential for job creation arising out of renewable power development, resource recovery expansion and our new businesses is significant.  We have conservatively estimated, and independently verified, that this plan will create and support significant direct and indirect jobs during the coming decade.  Importantly, these jobs will be sustainable and will support the green economy jobs, which will be based in the midlands. <\/p><p> In achieving this objective we are being assisted by and are engaging with a range of bodies, including the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, State agencies that include Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and many midlands local authorities which have been very proactive in their response to the company&rsquo;s transition needs.  We will also be engaging with EU-based institutions regarding potential supports that could be forthcoming there.   <\/p><p> I wish to mention also something about how this decarbonisation plan fits with our land use strategy.  Our decarbonisation plan includes a significant investment in the rehabilitation and restoration of bogs.  To date more than 15% of the total land area in Bord na M&oacute;na's ownership has been rehabilitated and-or restored in line with international, EU and national targets.  Bog rehabilitation and restoration provides a range of benefits, including lower land-based carbon emissions, increasing biodiversity and increasing provision of community and amenity lands.<\/p><p> In terms of carbon emissions, Bord na M&oacute;na is currently calculating the reduction in emissions that will accrue from the company&rsquo;s bog rehabilitation and restoration work.  Re-wetting raised bog means that the carbon that is in the ground stays in the ground.  It also provides greater opportunities to turn these sites into carbon sinks.  Final conclusions pending, at this stage the company expects that the reductions arising from this work will be significant.  These savings will be counted in the EU&rsquo;s third legislative pillar for greenhouse gas emissions, land use, land use change and forestry. <\/p><p> Other uses of rehabilitated bogs, as windfarms for example, demonstrate the compatibility of renewable energy generation with other outcomes, including improved biodiversity.  The developed footprint of windfarms is typically less than 5% of the entire area of the windfarm leaving the balance of 95% of the rehabilitated bog as a resource for biodiversity. <\/p><p> The importance of rehabilitation from a biodiversity point of view is especially pointed following the recent World Wildlife Fund report which highlighted the catastrophic 60% loss of animal populations in the past 40 years.  Restoration of raised bogs will help Ireland meet its biodiversity objectives, including commitments to conserve specific raised bog habitats under the EU habitats directive. <\/p><p> In parts of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate, Lough Boora Parklands for example, rehabilitated bogs provide extremely valuable tourist amenities attracting more than 100,000 visitors every year.  In many other parts of Ireland rehabilitated bogs provide valuable community amenities and a range of upsides including incalculable health benefits to people in those areas.<\/p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na began life as the Turf Development Board in the 1930s as a new company in a new Ireland that faced immense challenges.  The young State needed to demonstrate its viability by establishing its energy independence and use Irish resources to make it happen.  Bord na M&oacute;na was the instrument and demonstration of the State&rsquo;s ability to deliver jobs and energy independence.  Ireland and Bord na M&oacute;na now face another immense challenge.  We are taking action in response to climate change and decarbonising our business.  It is the right thing to do.  All of us in Bord na M&oacute;na are keenly aware that we must make this work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Donnellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donnellan for his presentation.

One of the central planks of Bord na M&oacute;na's strategy is replacing peat with renewables and, what Mr. Donnellan called, greenhouse gas neutral biomass energy.  Can he expand on how biomass will be greenhouse gas neutral, how much biomass into the future will be sourced domestically and how much will be imported?  Has the company considered the implications in terms of air quality issues when large amounts of biomass are being burned and how is the company addressing those issues?  Has Bord na M&oacute;na considered the sustainability impacts of importing biomass into the future, for example, the carbon footprint of shipping and road transport and also the displacement of food production?  Also, how can we encourage Irish farmers to produce biomass when they can achieve higher returns from other types of land use?  How is the company working with Coillte on bioenergy given their potentially complementary roles in this area?  What impact will the move to co-firing with biomass have on emissions from the three midlands power stations out to 2028?  Regarding the \"just transition\" process, what feasibility studies has the company undertaken to take into account the skills base of its current workforce and should all that work on feasibility studies not have preceded the announcement in recent weeks regarding the workforce and the impact that would have on them?<\/p><p>What support structure is needed from State agencies and Departments in respect of that just transition and to ensure that said transition is robust?<\/p><p> What proportion of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate has been severely degraded due to drainage and peat extraction?  Are there figures for this?  What work has Bord na M&oacute;na undertaken to identify this or to restore the boglands for the future?

What are Bord na M&oacute;na's plans for the production of peat briquettes and peat moss post 2028?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Chairman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I will first address what we call the just transition.  We must phase out peat.  Bord na M&oacute;na fully agrees with that and has faced up to it.  We have made a decision, which was part of our announcement, to get ahead of this and stop trying to push back the tide or keep it going for as long as possible.  We are committed to getting out of peat.  There is no question about that, it is just a matter of how we do that in a practical and managed way.  The first part is what we announced some weeks ago whereby we must reshape the company to get our financials in order as the public service obligation subsidies have come off.  The first part of the process is consolidation and simplifying.<\/p> <p>  The second part relates to a just transition.  We have been on a transition in recent years.  The first was Edenderry power plant, which we started to co-fire with biomass.  We will also move the two ESB ones to it.  We regard this as best practice in managing a transition.  One can look at the situation around the globe.  Our neighbours in the UK have substantially adopted biomass to provide dispatchable power.  In Scandinavia, ten plants are being constructed to burn biomass and, similar to what we are doing, another five are being converted.  We feel this is a good practice that will allow us time to transition away from peat.<\/p> <p>  There was a question of why we would not do it sooner.  Clearly, the sustainable supply of biomass is a challenge.  We are very concerned and very conscious that it must be sustainable.  Mr. Shier will outline how we will manage that.  Its supply is constrained so we could not go 100% biomass at this stage.  We will do it over a period.  We have successfully developed the indigenous biomass supply chain.  When we started co-firing the Edenderry plant, there was virtually no biomass supply chain in Ireland.  We have now taken that to approximately 400,000 tons.  In the region of 70% of what goes into the Edenderry plant is indigenous.  The biomass we burn is saw mill residue and thinnings.  We do not burn the trunk of the tree, we burn the top and bottom, the branches and what is left behind.  We are working to develop the indigenous supply chain further because it makes much more economic sense and there is a lower carbon footprint.  That will take time, however.  A lot of work is being undertaken with Coilte, our sister company, whereby we are looking at afforestation.  We are in discussions with them and have done some trials to see how we can increase afforestation in the country.  There is a challenge in peat based environment because of the nutrients but there are technological solutions.  We are exploring opportunities to increase afforestation by 20,000 to 30,000 acres in coming years which would feed into developing that indigenous supply chain.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Shier will speak on the sustainability of biomass and then I will return to the remainder of the Chair's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Donnellan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>It is not just a simple question of sustainability, biomass must clear several other hurdles.  First, there is the EU timber regulation where one must be certain that if something is coming from somewhere else, that it has been harvested legally.  Second, we have very tough and vital sanitary requirements.  One may not bring what one likes into this country, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will seek to inspect it and, with certain species, ensure that it has been heat treated in order to prevent the importation of pathogens.  The climate and energy package that has been going through Brussels has a whole new set of sustainability criteria that are past of Recast, the renewable energy directive, that biomass will have to meet into the future.<\/p> <p>  We have been working with an organisation called NEPcon, international experts in land use and sustainability, and have developed a suite of criteria with them which we will apply.  We are quite happy that most things grown in Ireland under our own forestry regulations and so on will meet all these criteria.  However, when trying to establish supply chains overseas, we must ensure that they meet these criteria, mainly because under the new regulations coming in the future, all the biomass that we use will have to be verified by a third party.  That is part of what will happen under the renewable energy directive.<\/p> <p>  On the carbon footprint, the rules and regulations relating to this are laid down in the renewable directive in the context of emissions along the supply chain.  We have quantified those.  The directive sets out thresholds where once it is below a certain threshold, biomass is deemed to be carbon-neutral.  Obviously, it has emissions but if they are low enough they are deemed to be carbon-neutral.  Those are the rules that we will work with.<\/p> <p>  On indigenous biomass, a great deal of forestry was planted in the 1980s and 1990s and is now coming on stream.  The volume available from Irish forests will increase over the next decade particularly from the mid-2020s.  Unfortunately, planting rates have dropped back considerably in the past decade or so.  We are not planting anywhere near what would be the target set by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the forest service.  That is a problem.  We had worked with the Department over several years to try to promote an energy crop scheme because we see them as being a shorter-term solution.  Forests take a long time to grow up to first thinning whereas energy crops are quicker.  However, it is very difficult to persuade Irish farmers or landowners to change land use.  We have found significant barriers to changing land use.  This will have to be relaunched and promoted into the future if we want to grow more indigenous biomass from the agricultural sector in addition to forestry.<\/p> <p> On emissions and air quality, it is true that burning biomass is like a solid fuel which leads to air emissions.  All three stations operate under integrated pollution control licences.  There are strict requirements on sulphur and nitrogen emissions and also particulates.  They all have different types of filtration systems on the back end of the flue gasses, resulting in very low levels of air emissions, either on the chemical side or particulates.  Burning biomass will not be any different to burning peat, the plants have to meet the same type of emission limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charles Shier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Ms Curry might speak on support for the workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Donnellan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Bord na M&oacute;na is trying to ensure that this is done through a voluntary scheme.

We would have put in place a community benefit package, as we always do, when we are developing some of these large infrastructural projects.  That particular wind farm is putting approximately &euro;100,000 per annum into the local community.  The package is split among a number of different areas.  There is support for various projects locally.  For example, in the village of Daingean, there would have been support for the laying of an astro pitch at a local national school where the grass was no longer suitable for playing on.  Initiatives such as playground projects, which are community based, were supported also.<\/p> <p>  We are also continuing to develop what we call a near neighbour scheme where we are trying to make sure that the neighbours closest to the wind farm benefit most from the package.  There is always conflict between the package and how it is disbursed locally and trying to make sure it benefits those who live closest to the wind farm.  In that regard, we are looking at supporting energy retrofits, developing community energy projects, scholarships and so on.  All of those type of initiatives are considered under the particular terms of reference of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The other development we have done at Mount Lucas, as Mr. Donnellan alluded to, is opened up the site as an amenity.  To answer the question on the development of further amenity spaces, trying to commercialise something like Lough Boora parklands is a challenge but where those amenities can be developed, co-located with commercial enterprises such as renewable developments such as wind farms, we believe that is the way to go.  That is a very considerable amenity.  It is opened up to people in terms of walkways and cycle ways.  We have installed the outdoor fitness centres and so on, working in conjunction with the local community.<\/p> <p>  The final action we have taken in Mount Lucas is created an energy hub from an educational perspective.  We get tens of thousands of school visits and visits from various interest groups where we try to tell the Bord na M&oacute;na story from start to finish.  The real idea behind it, however, is to promote the fact that renewable energy is here and it is good, despite the challenges faced in developing major infrastructure.  That project has gone very well.<\/p> <p>  It is our intention to continue to develop those sorts of packages around any of our wind farms or solar farms.  It is interesting that the footprint of a solar farm will take up much more space.  Typically, the footprint of a wind farm takes up approximately 2% or 3% of the land, therefore, there is a good deal of space for other developments including biodiversity and so on.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the question on the electricity exchange project, which is a very interesting one, one of the major challenges of any electric power system is the instantaneous balancing of demand and generation.  As we move into the green space, most of the generation is being provided by what we call intermittent sources, that is, wind and sun.  The sun does not shine at night time and the wind does not always blow, so managing that power system is becoming a greater challenge in terms of keeping on the lights.  It is infinitely doable, but one of the techniques used for that is what we call demand side management.  Rather than switching on generation when demand rises, there is an opportunity to take demand off the power system, for example, refrigeration, which does not need to be kept on all the time.  The men and women in the electricity exchange are working on software.  It is really a start-up software development company that can effectively use technology to instantaneously help manage that power system balance.  When we have a power system like the one we are headed for, which will be dominated by renewable generation, managing intermittency will be one of the biggest challenges.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the biomass element, biomass provides instantaneous thermal load to help manage that power system, while providing renewable energy.  That is one of the ways of doing it.  The other way is on the demand management side.

It is timely that they have come before the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  As Vice Chairman of this committee but also as a former employee of Bord na M&oacute;na, I have a particular interest in the area.  I have been frustrated for a number of years because I felt Bord na M&oacute;na would shut up shop.  That reflects what people say to me in the constituencies of Laois and Offaly who are very concerned about the future of Bord na M&oacute;na.  There has been a lack of consistency in Bord na M&oacute;na in the past decade or so in terms of trying to plan.  I sense from meeting the witnesses in the past month that a renewal is taking place, that they are looking at alternatives and trying to develop new businesses.  That is welcome, and we want to be with them on that in terms of fulfilling Bord na M&oacute;na's mandate for jobs in the midlands and developing industry.<\/p> <p>  Biomass will be a crucial issue but in terms of importing it, and Mr. Spier touched on this briefly, there is a huge footprint if we haul it long distances, be it from Indonesia, Africa or America.  I know the witnesses are trying to play catch-up because it has not been developed here.  In terms of the research, the willow scheme did not work out but silver birch grows naturally on cut-away bog and on marginal land.  How far advanced are we with that in terms of developing those new supply chains in the midlands?<\/p> <p>  On the Bord na M&oacute;na plant in Edenderry, 70% of the biomass going into that plant is from indigenous sources.  Will Mr. Donnellan outline briefly where that is coming from because it will surprise many people that 70% is from indigenous sources.  It is already burning 50% biomass.  In terms of the 70% from indigenous sources, where is it coming from and where could quick gains be made on that?<\/p> <p>  I understand the breaks have been put on the plans for the American plant but I would be interested to know if the company have plans to develop plants in other countries?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the jobs, the major fear is that the midlands will become what I refer to as the rust belt.  Before Bord na M&oacute;na started up, there was very little else in terms of employment in many parts of Offaly and Laois.<\/p><p>My father, who worked in Bord na M&oacute;na, often said that this was the case when he started in 1950.  There was little employment in towns such as Edenderry.  The concern is that we do not go back to that.  Bord na M&oacute;na will need substantial funding to make that transition.  It is a successful semi-State company but it does not carry a significant profit margin.  According to its annual reports over the years, it pays valuable a dividend to the State.  That is a valuable contribution in terms of tax and PRSI.  What funding do the witnesses think Bord na M&oacute;na needs to make that transition?  Is the climate action fund a realistic option for the company?<\/p><p> Has Bord na M&oacute;na been talking with Government about the current subsidy for peat burning?  Has it made a bid to have some of that funding hived off to make the transition to renewables?  With regard to baseload, during the past session, the witnesses referred to it briefly with wind and solar.  One can use solar during the day and wind at night.  However, they are intermittent sources.  There is a need to develop sources upon which we can rely for a baseload, or a continuous source of power such as biogas.  I would like Bord na M&oacute;na to put more focus on that.  There are opportunities to do that because we have a significant agricultural sector and a significant problem with agricultural waste.  We know that because the Government had to go to the EU again recently regarding pig slurry, which other countries turn into power.  They use that for generating power.  <\/p><p> How long does Bord na M&oacute;na think it will continue with the sale of peat compost and peat briquettes?  I have a particular interest in peat compost.  Regarding the Garryhinch project, the management before the previous management took us on a bus to Garryhinch, which is a cutaway bog.  There is a lot of talk about cutaway bogs and the environment.  I have heard people talk about them who have never put a foot on a bog.  Anybody who has ever been out on a cutaway bog would have seen that they have a significant environmental value because they are lower and easier to wet and there is considerable vegetation and wildlife on them.  There is significant potential for Garryhinch to be used as a water source, for attenuation and to solve a problem and possibly create something.  The River Barrow flows within a mile of it at the other side of the Mountmellick-Portarlington road.  The Barrow is on one side of it and Garryhinch is on the other.  For three or four months every year for the past number of years, the land to the right of it around Clonterry has been flooded and people have been unable to get in and out of their homes.  Garryhinch bog, which is lower, is on the other side of the road.  I am told that there is an underground culvert there but it would be very easy to use that for attenuation.  Perhaps Garryhinch could be used for Bord na M&oacute;na's aquaculture plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#F01200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>The witnesses have only two minutes to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1542121200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I do not expect them to give me answers today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#G00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>We will let the witnesses answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1542121200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Donnellan or Mr. Shier come back to me on Mountmellick, Portarlington and Garryhinch?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#G00500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>We have been aggressively developing indigenous biomass over the years.

Many of the questions have been asked and addressed so I will try to avoid repetition.  Mr. Donnellan finished off where I was about to start, which is the mandate under which Bord na M&oacute;na was established and, in principle, the recognition of the necessity to address a jobs crisis that existed in that region.  As the company goes through its transition, there is a difficulty with the loss of employment.  I am impressed by the strategy it has set out in the documentation.  The company accepts that it must move on.  Others have identified that it would have been all too easy to wind down the company and start concentrating on other areas such as other areas of the world and not use the company's capital base and funding but it has not done that.  Based on the presentation, management has clearly identified opportunities in areas that others have not identified.  Bord na M&oacute;na is examining alternative energy generation sources, which is good, and has the appropriate lands for that.  This is welcome in terms of where the overall energy strategy is going but, again, Bord na M&oacute;na rightly identifies that this is not its core mandate.  It is seeking to create employment.  When Bord na M&oacute;na talks about new opportunities, that is welcome and I hope it gets the support of other State agencies concerned with job creation, namely, IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland when it comes to the kind of supports that are necessary or that would be available to an organisation other than Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p><p>When Bord na M&oacute;na was established as a semi-State company the rules of the game were very different from what they are now.  They are based on our commitments within Europe and supports that have the potential to cause market distortions.  I expect and hope that Enterprise Ireland and the Government will recognise, through other means, the assistance that Bord na M&oacute;na needs in that regard.<\/p><p> The witnesses have covered many of the areas in which I am interested.  Bord na M&oacute;na owns a colossal amount of land so, for that reason, any other carbon sequestration opportunities that can be found would be great.  Mr. Shier has clearly identified what can be done with peatlands in terms of regeneration and the rewetting of the bogs.  One must consider whatever other land cover that can be provided.  I come from an area that is well familiar with bogland and being bogmen, as it were, so we fully get mixed land use as the land is not terribly arable and some of it varies in nature.  I ask Bord na M&oacute;na to develop a strategy on carbon sequestration in addition to the company's main purpose, which is to find meaningful employment for the people who reside in the area and from within resources.  I ask the witnesses for their thoughts on how that might progress.<\/p><p> I like the idea that was mentioned, which is secondary, but goes towards lifestyle and ensuring, as society evolves and develops, that younger people have a better appreciation of nature and habitats.  If we can inculcate or instill such appreciation in younger persons, it will allow them to live out their lives as citizens that are more in tune with nature and the environment than the generation that has gone before.

Up until now we have had the EU emissions trading scheme, ETS, and the burden or effort sharing agreement, with which Ireland struggles.  As Mr. Donnellan mentioned in his opening statement, from 2020 onwards, there will be a third pillar called land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, that will have to be reported on in five-year blocks.  Bord na M&oacute;na's peatlands fall into that category - not so much the product end, because that gets counted in the energy categories, but what happens on the land itself.  That is why over the past decade we have tried to quantify the emissions generated by different types of recolonised areas and different types of land use.  The cessation of harvesting does not stop emissions as residual peat still generates emissions and one way to reduce those is to rewet peatland.  Another way is to plant high-growth or high-yield crops on such land.  If afforestation is successful and is followed by quite a high growth yield, then the carbon sequestration from the trees is higher than what one loses from the land below.<\/p> <p>  One of the difficulties with increasing our own biomass relates to the accounting rules for biomass.  If willow, for example, is grown on peatlands, even though it will not grow very well, we would have to count the emissions from the soil as well.  If a residue from a factory or sawmill gate is used, then one cannot.  If one grows a crop, and one uses all of that crop for burning, then one must also count the emissions according to the rules.  That is why growing biomass on peatlands for use either in the power or heat sector is a tricky operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charles Shier"},{"type":"speech","time":1542121200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I was thinking more in terms of any vegetation that would be useful for carbon sequestration and perhaps not a cash crop.

Increasingly over the past couple of years, the company has begun to turn its attention to the challenges of decarbonisation in the transport and heating sectors.  Bord na M&oacute;na is looking very much at anaerobic digestion, biogas production and ways to make greater use of our large landbank.  In terms of these types of operations, we are also considering a technology called power to gas, which we considered about 15 years ago.  For example, windfarms can be developed.  When that wind energy cannot be used because the demand on the grid is not high enough, then it is used to create hydrogen as a chemical store, which can then be used in the natural gas grid and for methanation.<\/p> <p>  As the transition begins, we are considering ways to optimise our landbank.  Bord na M&oacute;na's total landbank is large at 80,000 ha but is quite small relative to the total peatlands in the country, and most of it is no longer what we would call peatlands, as Mr. Shier has described.  Looking at how we best utilise the landbank for infrastructural scale that can contribute to economy-wide decarbonisation, not just in the electricity sector on which we have been focused for years, but on the transport and heating sectors.

When we consider carbon capture, carbon sequestration, which has been mentioned by other members, the rewetting of the bogs and their potential to create opportunities, and the full life cycle, are the full environmental impact and benefits of biomass importation being considered?  A colleague of mine grows asparagus in the south of England.  The factory that processes his produce and the supermarket that sells it are located close to him.  Shockingly, the asparagus that he imports from Peru has a lower carbon footprint than that he grows in the south of England simply because the kilogrammes of dry matter that he grows in Peru is three times the volume he can grow in England.  Has sufficient work been done on the full life cycle calculations in some of these areas?  In other parts of the agricultural sector, in particular, we have been good at doing such calculations.

First, its must be ensured the biomass has been legally harvested or harvested in compliance with national legislation or whatever.<\/p> <p>  Second, one must make sure that wherever the biomass comes from, it is accounted for in the carbon balance for that region.  The new rules stipulate that one must take it from a country that is a signatory of the Paris Agreement.  Not only that, the country must have rules and programmes in place where they report their carbon balance on the land side back to the UN.  If a country does not have that, then one must carry out an assessment in terms of the fact that the carbon in the forest area, for example, is not being depleted by what one takes out of that land.  <\/p> <p>  As I said earlier, the accounting rule for deeming biomass to be carbon neutral is very precise.<\/p><p>It is quite a long, detailed equation which can be seen in annex 6 of the renewable energy directive.  We have to account for every bit of the harvesting procedure, including the energy use for transport and shipping if the biomass is being shipped, and landing it in port and so on.  The shipping end is the easy end.  People ship stuff all around the world, including oil, coal, gas, grain, and wood.  Wood is not necessarily shipped for energy but the pulp and paper industry ships it.  We are talking about very big vessels of 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes.  There are probably only three ports in Ireland where we could land that, and only two in practice.  In Dublin we could land it but there is not the storage; 40,000 tonnes of biomass is a pretty big pile on the dockside.  In reality we are looking at Greenore or Foynes as the two ports where we could bring in that size of ship.  With such big vessels, the carbon footprint of moving stuff across the sea is very low.  The carbon footprint of moving it from port to plant is probably higher than for shipping it across the ocean.

Invariably people wanted to plant the wet, boggy corner of the farm because it was not doing much for anything else so they thought they might put it into biomass.  The reality of the type of species and the breeding that is going on is that they are high yielding clones but they need high quality ground to get that yield out to make the economics work.  The riparian strip is an interesting one, though.  It has other benefits in terms of run-off, nutrient capture and so on.  That area is worth pursuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charles Shier"},{"type":"speech","time":1542121200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Have products like hemp been considered in the biomass discussion, or some of the newer products?

For example, a lot of people planted miscanthus in the past, even before the scheme got going here.  We ended up burning some in the early days to help out people who were stuck because there was no market.

There is an international group that is active in a number of countries researching growing sphagnum moss, not just harvesting it from bogs.  If a bog is preserved, we cannot really go and steal the carbon from the surface of it.  Growing sphagnum on a sustainable basis is a Holy Grail of the horticulture industry because if that could be cracked, it would provide a sustainable supply of sphagnum which they regard as the best material for growing plants and particularly for propagation.  However, very particular and precise conditions are needed to do it.  Sphagnum cannot be cultivated on cutaways because the water table has come down through the years and there is an influence of mineral material in the bottom which sphagnum does not like.  It has to be done on a bog that is still very well up to profile and that has acidic water conditions.  Then there is the difficulty of balancing between summer and winter.  We tried it on a small, pilot scale in Kilberry near Athy.  In the winter it was flooded and in the summer it was high and dry.  On a small scale, I would say \"Yes\", but to do it on a big scale over hectares we would have to laser level areas and would need very precise water control.  We would also need to stop other things coming in.

However, with Origin Green and with the ability of the land to take residual materials getting tighter and tighter, particularly from the agrifood sector, we think AD at scale is certainly likely to have its day.  In terms of the economics, the main focus in the last ten or 15 years has been on what renewable energy can be produced from AD.  In the scheme of things it is relatively expensive.  However, the picture changes if we consider AD in the first instance as a sustainable solution to waste management, particularly at scale.  There is a possibility of taking the biogas that is produced there and we are producing electricity from biogas from landfill.  We have learned a lot from that.  We believe directly injecting that methane back into the gas grid or potentially using it as compressed natural gas - a renewable gas as it is defined - will help the decarbonisation of the heating and transport sectors.  The project we are developing in Laois is focused first and foremost on doing it at scale, using that landbank to collect the waste, and then examining the direct injection into the gas grid of the methane or biomethane produced.  We have had great co-operation with Gas Networks Ireland.  This is something we could not have done four or five years ago.  It is the real manifestation of decarbonisation with organisations and companies working together.  The technical end of it is doable.

As a Kildare South Deputy with Newbridge, Kilberry and Drehid in my constituency, Bord na M&oacute;na's remit and role are very important to me.<\/p><p>I am aware that Bord na M&oacute;na's history has involved not only harvesting to provide fuel to generate energy but also the generation of a large number of jobs.  This remains the case in Kildare and across the midlands.  Bord na M&oacute;na faces a considerable challenge with decarbonisation and in continuing to generate fuel and energy through renewables and resource recovery.  It also faces a challenge in maintaining its position as a critical employer in areas such as Kildare, where jobs are crucial.  In that context, I welcome that the Minister has agreed to the redundancy package.  It is much improved by comparison with that offered in 2013.  I look forward to staff having the time to consider the package.  It was not ideal that there was a gap between details of the package emerging and the announcement of what was being sought in terms of redundancies.<\/p><p> There is much concern in Newbridge, where most of the administrative and management jobs have been located.  As a result of uncertainty regarding who will take packages and where the job losses will be, there is concern that Bord na M&oacute;na will consider the future of its base in the town.  Are our guests in a position to provide an assurance the Bord na M&oacute;na will stay in Newbridge and that the town will remain central to everything the company does?  This is really important, not only for the employees in the area but also to secondary businesses and those whose jobs have been created indirectly.<\/p><p> In Kilberry, there are 70 or 80 staff employed at the peat moss operation.  Have existing customers signed contracts for 2019?  Do our guests envisage a significant reduction in operations next year?  Do they hope that the operations can continue?  In the longer term, as other companies and Bord na M&oacute;na's customers move to becoming peat-free, what will be the opportunities for the site in Kilberry?<\/p><p> I was interested to hear about the links with the likes of Offaly County Council in certain areas.  Has there been engagement with Kildare County Council?  Have there been discussions with the excellent people in Kildare local enterprise office to examine the future options to ensure we can continue to provide very important jobs in the area?<\/p><p> I will not elaborate on the climate action funds, amounting to &euro;500 million, into which the company will need to tap.  They will be really important.  I completely accept the point that the company needs financial support to do what it wants to do.  Bord na M&oacute;na's greatest asset is its staff.  Its second greatest asset is its landbank.  I am really encouraged by many of the positive initiatives in which the company is seeking to become involved.  In that context, anaerobic digestion has considerable potential.<\/p><p> What are the links with Departments?  What strikes me most at meetings of this committee is the need for a whole-of-Government approach involving accessibility and the interlinking of all Departments.  Everything Bord na M&oacute;na is seeking to do directly involves Departments.  Can our guests outline whether they have a direct line of contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding land use and the Department of Education and Skills in the context of the application for the globalisation fund?  How important will the latter be?  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will be very important in the context of renewables.  The Department Transport, Tourism and Sport will be important in respect of electric cars, developing supports in this regard and the tourism element.  Biodiversity is very significant.

Newbridge is our headquarters and remains so.  People in Newbridge are saying, \"Newbridge or nowhere.\"  We are staying there.  Kildare, including Newbridge, has been very good to us and very supportive of us.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is more than familiar with the Drehid site.  It is an old site we would like to develop and upgrade.  We would like to spend a bit of money on it because we are not going out of business.  We are reinventing ourselves and diversifying, and we are building for the future.  Clearly, we see Newbridge as the place we will be based in this regard.  That is critical.  Some of the management and administration jobs there will be affected.  As the package will be voluntary, we will try to manage the operation in a fair and just way.  We will give people lots of time and work with them.  Our desire is to make the process as smooth as possible.<\/p> <p>  We have been very open and transparent with the people in Kilberry.  As we go through change management, our approach is to be open and transparent.  We find that works best rather than coming with surprises.  Our approach is to tell people what is going on.  We have been upfront with Kilberry on what is going on with the customers and the peat-free agenda, especially in horticulture.  We have confirmed to the staff that, for the 2019 season, customers have confirmed they will place the orders.  There is a big question as to whether the large UK customers will go peat-free in 2020.  As a result of the fact that we manufacture the product in Kilberry, we are trying to convince the customers not to go peat-free.  We are having that discussion.  We are being very upfront with the Kilberry teams on that.  As soon as we have any information either way, we will be first down there.  We are also examining whether there are other opportunities in the area.  It is a green waste facility and has a licence.  If the UK customers say they are going peat-free, there will be a significant impact on Kilberry but there is no question that we want to pull out of there or anything of that nature.  I reassure the Deputy on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy and others made an important point regarding links with Departments.  We are open to all the support, ideas and help we can get.  We are not looking inwards but outwards.  We are going through a significant transformation, which presents many challenges.  We are working with some Departments.  We know them well and are getting doors opened where we need them opened.  We welcome any offers from everybody on the committee in the context of opening further doors.  We are working with Enterprise Ireland, which is really helping us.  We are working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we are working with the Department of Education and Skills on the European funds and we are working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We must broaden our reach in terms of who we work with.  Given the number of areas we are getting into, whether energy, tourism or funding, we have to work the network.  I would not say we have got it sorted out but we are getting at it.  We have got a concrete plan as to how to do it.<\/p> <p>  The final question was on Drehid, which is a very well-managed, successful landfill site.  We have significantly reduced the amount of tonnage there.  We see a future for the site.  Planning permission has been sought for an extension.  This is currently going through the process.  We are carrying out some environmental impact studies.

On the issue of the transition, it is essential that we achieve a low-carbon or zero-carbon economy in addition to the company's objectives.  Much of the presentation referred to issues that will arise in the midlands when the company stops burning peat, including the question of what the transition will involve, the impact on staff, plans for 500 new jobs and the creation of sustainable businesses.  The latter is very welcome.  I know well the impact of the closure of a power station because the one at Bellacorrick was closed.  The region in question in north Mayo is pretty devastated and has not recovered because the plant was a major employer.  I would like to believe that in all this, there can be a re-examination of these areas, which were so loyal and serviced Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the plans for the 172 MW wind farm in Oweninny.  It is under construction.  The community has for the most part accepted the building of the wind farm.  I was at the oral hearing.  There were community representatives present and they said the will accept the wind farm but want community gain and benefits because the community is crying out for some investment and support because of the closure of the peat-burning power station.  This is a topic on which I have written to our guests.  This project is not going well.  The community has accepted the wind farm, yet there is a serious conflict over a community fund and how it is to be administered.  I refer to benefits for the people most immediately affected and those whose visual amenity will be affected by virtue of the turbines, which are to be nearly twice the height of the cooling tower.  I cannot figure out why, with all Bord na M&oacute;na's stated ambitions to benefit communities and have sustainability, there are people protesting near the site.  They are concerned about the operation and construction of the wind farm but they are also anxious about the fund.  Some &euro;232,000 per annum is to be distributed in the community.  I have heard some Bord na M&oacute;na representatives say communities sometimes do not have projects on which to spend a community fund in its fifth or sixth year, yet the community in question is asking that individual households within a certain radius be looked after.<\/p><p>When I raised the need for intervention, the response I received was that people are on the ground.  That is not working, however, and there is a need for intervention at a more senior level.<\/p><p> The matter has been batted over to Mayo County Council, but Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB need to show more leadership on this.  This can be a good news story and a formula can be found for individual households to benefit.  The community centres and so on are good, but this is a burning issue.  I would like to see the fire quenched and the issue dealt with.  No more oil must be poured onto the fire.  A message should be communicated that this is all fine and under control and that the money will be there.  Communities deserve better and need to be engaged with more.  Every community will have its issues.  Those issues need to be tackled in this instance, particularly as the money is there and there is support for the wind farm.

The crucial aspect is that Mayo was responsible for the administration of the fund, but the governance of the administration of that fund will require the establishment of a board, which will include a member from the wind farm development company, two members from the local community, two members who are local representatives and two members from Mayo County Council.  We understand the locals' concerns, which are about how this money will be distributed and by which mechanisms it will distributed.  At this time, we cannot prejudice the operation of that board, but we are fully agreed that we, as the developers of the wind farm, want to see a governance arrangement that will allow the bulk of that money to flow locally.  As Mr. Reilly stated, we will work tirelessly with Mayo and the board to ensure that happens in the best interests of the local communities.  We can assure them of that but they are looking for prescriptive guarantees.

No one I know in the environmental sector, nor anyone I know who has expertise of energy, thinks it will be sustainable.  Two thirds of the energy goes up the chimney as waste heat, for example.  As the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland states on page 13 of its most recent report in the context of renewable heat and where we need to use biomass, \"Increased use of biomass for electricity generation ... reduces the national biomass resource available for business looking to use it for renewable heat\".  It also states, \"It also increases the cost of the biomass resources for heat ... [by up to] 4-fold\".  The target from which we are furthest away is that relating to renewable heat.  If all three stations are converted to full-scale biomass, that is, without the use of peat, how many tonnes of biomass will be needed?

I have a few quick questions.  Mr. Donnellan was not there at the time, but Donnelly's Coal in Galway was closed last year with redundancies.  This Christmas, the coal yard in Sligo is closing and Bord na M&oacute;na is involved in that.  Derryfadda on the western side of the Shannon is out of peat production.  Mr. Donnellan referred to 150 jobs going but he needs to be honest with the committee.  Those are redundancies and the jobs are not being replaced.  Wind turbines do not replace jobs.  I have listened to Mr. Donnellan talk about Kildare and it is positive that Bord na M&oacute;na is going to keep its head office there.  He referred to going into aquaculture, which is a seven-year project and, having spoken to his people myself, I understand it may not work.  Bord na M&oacute;na is also intending to grow herbs for medicines, but that may not work either.  We have no plan going into the future.  What is envisaged west of the Shannon, which is an area that has been good to the company down through the years?  There are 50 to 60 jobs going in Derryfadda and there will be no production west of the Shannon from next January.  It is a place that provided the company with good workers and which co-operated with it down through the years.<\/p> <p>  I refer to biomass.  What is the carbon footprint of a tonne of biomass brought from north Africa, Australia or parts of America?  Can Mr. Shier provide the accurate carbon footprint per tonne?  The witnesses referred to growing some in Ireland.  I have spoken to farmers who are in Bord na M&oacute;na's biomass scheme currently.  It costs &euro;400 an acre to rent land in the dairy sector in the south of the country.  In other places, it may be between &euro;200 and &euro;250 an acre.  Biomass is not providing returns.  Is the company calling on the Government to provide a proper subsidy?  It is in wonderland if it thinks farmers will go down the biomass route on the basis of the figures mentioned.  We have heard about fuel security and the green agenda over the past number of years.  Everybody in the country is being told that if we go green, we will not need imports.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, but if we go down the biomass route, we will import &euro;65 million to &euro;120 million of extra imports between now and 2027.  That money will go out of the country on foot of the decision Bord na M&oacute;na has taken in the past six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#N01800","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I will take the questions one by one.

I will be as brief as I can.  I do not want to repeat what has already been said.  The ramifications and repercussions of decarbonisation for the region have been and are great.  If Deputy Pringle were here, I would remind him about the closure of power stations in Ferbane and Rhode and the loss of the associated harvesting jobs.  A decline has been evident in the region, particularly in County Offaly.  There are 900 workers in the county at present, compared to 400 in County Kildare, 200 in County Longford, 50 in County Westmeath and 12 in County Laois.  Those jobs are great for workers and their families and for communities.  I accept that diversification has been taking place.  Further diversification is planned involving existing wind, solar and waste operations.  There are some exploratory measures involving fish farming, herbs and energy parks.  We have seen the success at Lough Boora, where there is potential for further growth.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding all of that, I suggest that Bord na M&oacute;na can no longer meet the remit that was placed on its board in the 1940s when it was put in place by &Eacute;amon de Valera and Todd Andrews.  That remit is now in the hands of the Government.  This gets very political, to be quite honest.  For reasons of policy and commitment, there is an onus on the Government to put an adequately resourced just transition forum or sustainability forum in place for this region.  I appreciate that we have been given a commitment today in respect of the &euro;40 million package.  We have to learn lessons from what happened in Littleton.  There were 23 meetings before an agreement was reached in that case.  I do not want to see that taking place in this instance.  Last week, on behalf of Offaly County Council I met representatives of State agencies, bodies and Departments that have a responsibility without being instructed at all.  We hope they live up to the expectation that is on them in respect of retraining and reskilling, etc.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask some specific questions about the commitment to the workforce that will remain, or is expected to remain, up to 2027.  It is expected that the ESB will make an application for co-fuelling.  Such an application is long overdue.  I hope and expect that in the next week, it does what it has committed to do, at least.  I would like the witnesses to square a circle for me in that context.  I understand it was envisaged that under the public service obligation, the cost of fuelling the three power plants would be approximately &euro;40 per tonne.  When the public service obligation is gone next year, that figure will decrease to &euro;20 per tonne.  Given that it was difficult enough to maintain and ensure viability at &euro;40 per tonne, can viability be guaranteed and ensured at &euro;20 per tonne?  Can we receive a cast-iron commitment to that effect?  Can the workers who will be associated with providing and harvesting peat be assured and reassured that assuming permission is obtained and the application is made as envisaged, they will able to make those stations work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#O01200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked some very important questions.  As part of the restructuring we are doing, especially at management and administration levels, we are reducing our cost base in order to be able to absorb the elimination of the public service obligation.  We are reducing our costs so that things which are not as popular as they were in the past can be kept going.  We want to achieve a just transition while we build out other areas of opportunity.  Those plans will continue to run on the basis of a number of factors, the first of which the Deputy has touched on.  I refer to the question of whether planning will be obtained for the two ESB projects and, if so, how long it will run for.  Will the Edenderry project get planning when it comes out of planning in 2023?  The cost of carbon is another important factor which will determine future viability.  We currently trade carbon as part of a European scheme.  It trades at between &euro;15 and &euro;20 a tonne.  We have to buy.  A number of years ago, the price was &euro;5 or &euro;6 a tonne.  If the cost of carbon increases substantially - for example, to &euro;30 a tonne - the viability of the plants will be called into question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Donnellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1542121200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>That brings me to another point.

I would have thought that there is a blueprint for permission to be repeated at the Shannonbridge and Lanesborough plants because of the process that was initially gone through for Edenderry.  I hope and expect that those who cast doubt on the potential for Edenderry to meet its commitments associated with the Environmental Protection Agency and the planning conditions will be mindful of the expectation of the greater community and region with regard to these two plants when they look at the applications that are made.  That is not to say that the applications should get a <i>carte blanche<\/i>.  People should be respectful of the process that has begun.  It should be allowed to work itself out.  Communities should be allowed to adjust to that change.  The point I want to make to this committee is that based on what the CEO has said, there is no cast-iron commitment that he can live up to the expectation that he has up to 2027.  This means that many of the jobs I am discussing will remain in jeopardy in the short term, rather than in the medium or long terms.  As I have said, Bord na M&oacute;na cannot meet the remit it was given in the 1940s, which is understandable.  That is why the Government must not depend on existing sources of revenue for the region.  Those revenue sources already exist from a national perspective.  They can be drawn from all over the country.  The Government and the EU must have a specific and targeted initiative and effort to ensure this region has a chance of getting through this transition and is stronger coming out of it than it was going into it.  My party and I will not be found wanting to that end.  I hope this committee makes that point to the Minister and to those who have a responsibility to this region.

The industry term for EirGrid is the transmission system operator, TSO.  EirGrid subsequently became the system operator for Northern Ireland, SONI, and, since 2009, the transmission system functions on a fully integrated, seamless, all island basis. <\/p> <p>  We operate on a 24-7 basis, 365 days of the year, from control centres in Ballsbridge, Dublin and Castlereagh, Belfast to bring conventional and renewable power from where it is generated in hundreds of different locations around Ireland to where it is needed in Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>We use this grid to supply power to industry and businesses that use large amounts of electricity and here in the Republic, our grid also powers the ESB&rsquo;s distribution network, which supplies the electricity people use every day in their homes, businesses, schools, hospitals, and farms.<\/p><p> We also manage and operate the all-island electricity market where generators, suppliers and other electricity traders buy and sell electricity in real time, a market with an annual turnover of approximately &euro;2.5 billion.  As recently as 1 October 2018, we managed the transition of the market from the old single electricity market to the new integrated single electricity market which places the Irish electricity market on a pan-European trading platform and this has created the environment for a more competitive market and opens the door for greater connectivity with Europe in the longer term. <\/p><p> A vitally important part of what we do is developing new electricity infrastructure which supports both a growing economy and population.  In doing so we are very conscious of the impact on communities and have made great efforts over the last number of years to engage with communities and improve overall understanding and acceptance levels for energy infrastructure across the island.  We support competition in energy, promote economic growth and job creation and, most important for this committee&rsquo;s consideration, we enable the growth of renewable energy onto the electricity system.<\/p><p> As a nation, we are becoming increasingly aware of the stark reality of what is happening in the world.  I believe this committee, working on the strong platform provided by the Citizens' Assembly report, is a very positive step towards placing Ireland on the right trajectory towards a low carbon future thus addressing the very real and existential threat of climate change. <\/p><p> I will speak to three major topics which are very relevant to Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation challenge and then conclude with some broad-reaching comments. <\/p><p> I will begin with the critical matter of successfully integrating renewables on our power system.  The island of Ireland is an isolated stand-alone electricity system on the western periphery of Europe with limited connectivity to the UK as an alternative source of power.  This contrasts with mainland Europe where extensive cross-border interconnection creates significantly greater flexibility for European countries. <\/p><p> The physics of electricity which originates from renewable sources such as wind and solar is significantly different from that deriving from conventional generation which has been around for over 100 years.  As a result, significant challenges to power system stability arise when attempting to integrate high levels of renewables on a conventional or synchronous power system, to use the technical term.  Were I asked ten years ago what level of renewables could be accommodated on Ireland&rsquo;s synchronous power system at any point in time, I might have said 10% at an absolute maximum.  Ten years of pioneering work by our scientists and engineers under a programme called DS3 has delivered a world record level of 65% renewables on the power system, an achievement which will underpin an expected average delivery of over 30% renewable electricity on the Irish system in 2018.  Our innovations have delivered a new industry in system services which resulted in the awarding of over 100 contracts in May of this year.  These services ensure system stability when high levels of renewable are on the system.<\/p><p> Our achievements in this area are recognised internationally as we entertain fact finding missions from across the globe on a regular basis.  I was privileged last Thursday to host EU Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi to our national control centre to demonstrate how we have innovated to achieve this renewable energy milestone.  The EU is looking to replicate Ireland&rsquo;s achievements on a pan-European basis, having allocated &euro;20 million to a project called EU Sysflex, which is being led by EirGrid.  <\/p><p> However, we can &ndash; and I believe we will &ndash; go further in terms of integrating ever higher levels of variable renewable energy onto the grid.  We have publicly committed to moving to integrating 75% variable renewable energy on the system by 2020 in order to underpin Ireland and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions to deliver 40% of electricity from renewable sources by this date.  The renewable electricity target is a vital component in Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 overall renewables target, particularly in a context where the transport and heat targets are under severe pressure.  This is challenging, but we believe it can be done and, more important, that it must be done if we are to truly move away from our dependence on fossil fuels. <\/p><p> Second, we are endeavouring to transition to a low carbon economy at a time when the forecast for both economic and population growth is very strong, infrastructure across many, if not most, sectors of the economy is under pressure and demand for electricity, indeed all forms of energy, is expected to be strong over the next five to ten years.  Growing demand means that advance planning is now more important than ever.  This is as relevant to planning the future needs of the electricity grid as much as it does for schools, hospitals and roads. <\/p><p> Over the last two years, we have devised a scenario planning report called &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Energy Scenarios&rdquo; which sets out four potential energy scenarios to the year 2030.  The scenario which will be realised depends greatly on which policy levers are put in place by policy-makers such as this committee over the coming years.<\/p><p> If one looks at what is happening in the global economy, and we must remember we are one of the most open economies in the world, I believe it is reasonable to say that the world is on an inexorable trajectory to transitioning towards economies and societies which are free of carbon.  Ireland is unlikely to diverge from this global trend and, considering our current position in the European league table, we will need to refocus and accelerate our efforts to decarbonise our own economy and society over the next decade.  I can assure this committee that we in EirGrid understand the compelling case facing the country and are working to ensure that we will be to the fore in enabling this unprecedented transition.<\/p><p> Third, the question is repeatedly asked about where the next generation of renewable generation will come from.  In terms of a managed transition from fossil fuels to renewables, we see there being a requirement for a broad spectrum of renewable sources.  To date, the bulk of the renewables delivered on the system and forecasted to 2020 has been onshore wind.  We should ask ourselves why onshore wind has been so successful, so that we can leverage those lessons as we look to the challenges of the next decade.  I will outline those key lessons.  First, in 2008 the Government set a clear and unambiguous target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources.  The policy was crystal clear.  Second, the Government provided the policy framework to enable the regulatory authority to administer a connections policy for renewables projects.  Third, the Government designed a support mechanism, with appropriate State aid approval from Europe.  Finally, industry, both private sector and commercial State sector, supported by an eco-system of planning, engineering, legal and financing expertise responded and delivered projects varying in size from a few megawatts to over 100 megawatts in scale, resulting in close to 5,000MW of onshore wind across the island of Ireland by early next year.   <\/p><p> While onshore wind will play a vital role in the next decade, it cannot provide the totality of requirements for Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation needs.  There is a role and a need for a broader range of technologies including solar and offshore wind.<\/p><p> EirGrid is currently progressing connection offers for a significant quantum of solar projects across the country and we look forward to the Department&rsquo;s plans to design an appropriate support system to enable solar projects to be financed, constructed and ultimately connected to the power system.  <\/p><p> I now draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the area of greatest opportunity and positive impact for Ireland in dealing with the challenges around our carbon emissions trajectory, namely the enormous potential in Ireland for offshore wind energy developments.  A very big onshore wind farm can generate 100 MW while a small offshore wind farm can generate 500 MW with the potential can exceed 1,000 MW. <\/p><p> Currently there is only one 25 MW offshore wind farm in operation in Ireland or Northern Ireland, with approximately 5.6 GW having applied to connect to the electricity system, predominantly off the east coast.  Offshore wind is a very mature technology, prices have dropped considerably in the last decade, European auctions for offshore wind farm projects have seen highly competitive pricing and, frankly, the time has come for Ireland to embrace offshore wind at scale as a vital element in our fight to reverse the trajectory of carbon emissions from industry and society.  However, our understanding is that the consenting regime for offshore wind farms is not fit for purpose and is therefore operating as a barrier to developers to committing development capital to new developments which means that a pipeline of such projects will not be ready to compete in future auction processes.<\/p><p> EirGrid has conducted significant studies to identify the optimum delivery model for planning and enabling the development and connection of offshore wind energy to the Irish transmission system.  We have assessed a number of grid-delivery models in other jurisdictions and our view is that the most cost-effective optimum model is the centralised model which is used in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands.  The centralised model would mean EirGrid, in a co-ordinated way, would masterplan and secure planning consent for an optimum offshore grid network into which offshore wind developers would ultimately connect.  Phase 1 of such a masterplan would be focused on the east coast of Ireland. <\/p><p> EirGrid is advancing our Celtic interconnector project with our counterpart in France, a project which is designed to provide 700 MW of interconnection between Ireland and France by 2025-26.  This project is vital to supporting Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy ambition as it will provide a vital outlet for Irish wind energy at times when demand on the Irish system is low. <\/p><p> EirGrid has a vital role to play, and we will play that role, in enabling the transformation of our economy and our society, a change which is arguably greater than the industrial revolution or the arrival of the Internet.<\/p><p> I will conclude with some broad reaching comments which are not necessarily restricted to EirGrid&rsquo;s remit, but where we can offer an authoritative and dispassionate view on those matters which are currently impeding progress in renewable energy.<\/p><p> The challenge is very significant and the urgency is manifest.  Electricity has delivered the best performance to date in terms of decarbonisation and is likely to bear a heavy burden in the next decade.  No single technology offers a silver bullet.  By our calculations onshore wind, solar and offshore wind will all be required in significant quanta to make the necessary impact in the next decade.  Explicit targets for 2030, at a policy level, for RES-E, RES-H and RES-T must be set which when combined are capable of delivering the necessary overall result for Ireland.<\/p><p> Wind energy guidelines for onshore wind are essential to enable the next generation of onshore projects to be consented.  A robust policy on a consenting and connections regime for offshore wind needs to be put in place as a matter of urgency.  Technology-specific support mechanisms, for example offshore, need to be signalled, designed and made ready for implementation in the near term.<\/p><p> I hope we have given members an understanding of what we have already achieved in the fight against climate change and what we believe must now happen to ensure all elements of the power system can make the necessary contribution to delivering a substantially decarbonised electricity system in the next decade.  I commend the members of the committee on their efforts to date and encourage them to be ambitious in the report they will be writing for Government in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Foley.

I mentioned the consenting regime.  The second dimension is a connections policy.  At the moment we do not have a connections policy allowing a developer to approach us in a regulated context and get a contract with us.  Third, we do not have in place an option framework or regime specific to offshore energy generation, which recognises the specific technology used offshore.

If we want to do better than that, we need to increase the rate at which renewable capacity is connected to the system.  We have been very successful in connecting onshore wind and we now have a fresh challenge of connecting offshore wind at a quantum that will match and exceed that 40% target.<\/p> <p>  The interest in offshore wind energy generation has been off the east coast, which is closer to the demand than those large generators the Chairman mentioned off the west coast.  Therefore it is well placed relative to grid infrastructure.  If an offshore grid were constructed, it would be connected into an area of the grid that needs and can benefit from support.<\/p> <p>  The idea of a centralised strategic plan for offshore wind energy generation has many benefits.  It would allow us to set out the plan and deliver it in a co-ordinated manner in parallel with the offshore development.  Traditionally we wait for someone to come along and ask to connect to our system.  We then look at what the implications for the system would be.  We then develop an infrastructure plan to manage that.<\/p> <p>  More recently with the data centre growth we have had a rush of connection requests for significant amounts of demand.  That puts pressure on that process and we have had to look at that afresh to try to find a more strategic way of managing that.  That will continue to be the case in how we match our system capability with the demand that is there.  We have to match the contribution the transmission grid makes and the contribution that generation support makes.  We have talked a bit about the data centres and their requirement to be supported from renewable energy.  First the renewable energy sources need to be there.  We have an integrated single electricity market that allows all players to construct bilateral contracts behind the scenes and the market allows us to run the system in the most efficient manner and deliver the best prices to customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robin McCormick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Why have the power-purchase agreements not taken off here as they have in other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>It is because we have a market for electricity at a wholesale level.

I have a number of questions on making changes to the grid for the future.  We know there is a potential for up to 75% of intermittent power to be integrated on the grid.  I understand that we went as high as more than 60% and as low as 4% on a couple of days during the summer.  Obviously, we were not using much power on those days.  That would tell me that solar power is not being integrated into the grid.  In terms of trying to cater for micro-generation, if we had a lot of small companies, private individuals or farmers supplying small-scale generation, would the grid be able to cope with it?  What are the major barriers to that happening?  While we do not have all-day sunshine, we have significant periods of sunshine.  However, we do not seem to have progressed as far as other countries in harnessing solar energy.<\/p> <p>  If electric vehicles were to become common, would the grid be able to cope with people plugging them into their home chargers?  This relates to the first question in the context of the demand that would place on the grid.  Has EirGrid done anything in respect of micro-grids.  We have a national grid - and I can see the logic in that - but are there plans to develop micro-grids whereby it would make sense to generate and use the power within a particular area?<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions on baseload and dispatchable power.  Much of our sources of energy will be from intermittent generation, such as wind and solar energy.  There is a real concern in terms of wind-down and start-up costs for power plants and the cost of the grid overheating or then not having enough supply.  Has EirGrid plans in place to use other sources such as biogas and hydroelectric generation to meet the greater demand from a growing population?  I acknowledge that hydro-generation provided all the electricity we ever needed in the 1920s.  However, it is not the 1920s and Ardnacrusha no longer does what it used to do.   We have a large number of small sources of hydropower that have the potential to be used and again this is a source of power that is underdeveloped in this country, which would add to the baseload to ensure a secure source of power when wind and sun are not there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#S01200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Our guests can answer those questions in any order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#S01300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I will take on the many questions from Deputy Stanley, who alluded to the challenge of operating a system with renewable energy.  We have described the progress we have made operating on a system with a lot of onshore wind, which is intermittent.  We try to forecast it as best we can and then we try to run the system on the back of that.  There will be days when there is little wind and there will be some days when there are record amounts of wind.  Last Friday, there was a new record in respect of wind on the system.  That has been a significant technical challenge for us and the benefit of that is that the more wind we can accommodate on the system the better the prices of electricity and the more we benefit from the decarbonisation of electricity generation.<\/p> <p>  We have made great strides on our journey to integrate intermittent supply and the 40% target set for 2020 is achievable.  For us the challenge is to move the instantaneous level of renewals from the 65% which is the present level to 75% in 2020.  The benefit of that is that if we achieve that 75% target there is less curtailment of all the wind that is connected so there are times when we have to ask those wind generators to generate less because the system would not remain stable if we did not do that.  That is the journey we are on.  Deputy Stanley is correct to recognise that there is a great deal of change ahead.  One of the ways we have tried to assess it is to introduce our tomorrow's energy scenarios.  These involve engaging with society at large and with our stakeholders in order  to try to understand how people see the future.  Will it be much of what we have had or will there be a significant level of customer action?<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised many different changes that could impact on how we manage the grid, including that relating to micro-generation.  Micro-generation would impact on it effectively from our perspective because there would not be as much demand.  There could be more solar energy and electric vehicles.

I would like some clarity on three points.  First, there has been much reference to micro-generation.  Having spoken to some of our counterparts in Europe and to businesses which are involved in micro-generation, namely, businesses with a high electricity demand and the ability to generate same, there is an appetite for an adjacent business to be able to share or trade that electricity between those businesses.  Is that something that is far off in the future and could not be considered at the moment or is it something that we could deliver in the short to medium term?  Could adjacent businesses use the grid to effectively shift energy and electricity between each other and trade same?<\/p> <p>  Second, when we look at the success of renewables in Europe, much of it is attributed to the fact that it is very much a community initiative.  Is there a mechanism where a community initiative to generate renewable energy could be shared, utilising the grid to bring the electricity back to members of the community?<\/p> <p>  Third, I refer to investment, specifically in smart technology.  As much as we can produce more renewable electricity, we probably need to look at being more efficient in how we use electricity and having a capacity to store it for use in times of need because of the variability or intermittent nature of renewables.  Is enough investment taking place in that area and is there a strategic approach to it on a national level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#T01400","speaker":"1439"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>The idea that the Senator described of adjacent businesses going into business with each other to trade energy requires changes to the tariff arrangements that exist at the moment.

As a business, we have invested in quite a lot of innovation to manage the grid, with 65% at the moment and 75% by 2020.  We constantly look for opportunities to innovate, particularly in the area of infrastructure.  Building infrastructure for a grid company is a challenge and we have tried to engage much more with communities to explain the various options.

We are way behind with the infrastructure required for electric cars, particularly when one hears what people who own such vehicles have to go through in order to charge them.  If Ireland moves fast in the context of providing incentives and so forth for electric cars, it appears it will not be able to keep up with providing enough power points to facilitate that.<\/p> <p>  Our guests referred to extra wind and going to 40% or higher.  My understanding is that wind comes in at variable speeds.  What is the cost to the generators when wind comes in to smooth it out?  I hear that the ESB would have to spend &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million in this regard.  Is that right?<\/p> <p>  Our guests and other members spoke about micro-generation.  Our guests indicated that it is a case of making a guess where it is produced in small amounts, but I cannot see it being very complicated.  Either one gives a price for something - be it 13 cent per unit, 20 cent or whatever - or one does not.  Our guests stated that there are no set tariffs.  Can a tariff not be set quite easily?<\/p> <p>  I stand open to correction, but my understanding of what our guests are doing is that they are saying to Joe Bloggs with the wind turbine, the person with the solar panel and the individual using the fossil fuel that they will need X amount from each.  If they keep getting a fair amount of wind and they tell the guy with the fossil fuel that they do not need him as much now, will he not disappear?  Can they live without the fossil fuel?  My understanding is that they cannot.  Am I correct that this year is one of the worst in history for generating wind power - I am not referring to the number of generators or wind turbines - due to the wind speeds, and that four of the past five years have been quite bad?  Is it also correct that EirGrid will need either a gas power plant or some type of what I would call a second engine on stand-by to generate electricity because it cannot rely on the other types of generation?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the interconnector between Ireland and France and to exporting electricity to France.  France has nuclear power and that is the cheapest form of electricity.  Why would it take electricity from us?  We heard a few years ago that we were going to export energy to England.  How much wind-generated energy are we exporting to England?  Is there a danger if we get electricity from France at a cheap price?  Obviously, money talks and this is a business.  If the grid can get it at a lower price it would be more inclined to take it from there rather than taking it from somebody else at a higher price.  Regarding the tariff on wind and what the customer pays, am I correct that the person who owns the wind turbine gets more per unit than what the customer pays the ESB for the electricity?  How much electricity, in money terms, is dumped per year because EirGrid has entered agreements that it must adhere to with regard to renewables?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111300002#W01300","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542121200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions.  Mr. McCormick is suggesting that I start with electric vehicles because I drive one and I know a great deal about the experience.  That might sound as if I am joking but it is true.  We do not have a role to play in this, to put it simply.  As a consumer, however, I notice many private companies are starting to install charging points.  If one goes to Aldi or Lidl, one can charge one's electric vehicle so I believe the momentum is starting to build.  I am speaking as a consumer, not as the CEO of EirGrid.<\/p> <p>  On micro-generation, I know it sounds simple but, to be clear, there must be a policy framework, a technical way in which power can go from the home to the grid and a proper regulationary tariff.  We have none of that at present.  We have a very limited role to play in that regard.  I am not ducking the question but that is the current reality.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about living without fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels will be here.  They are not disappearing but they will exist at a very low level on the system in the future.  Renewables will be the dominant source of generation.  The technology and services that have been developed by EirGrid will allow fossil fuels to operate at very low levels - low levels never previously dreamed of - to provide system stability.  As long as the market provides appropriate remuneration for them to be there and to provide that service, we have nothing to fear from a security of supply perspective.  We are confident we have a very good handle on that.  Working with the regulator and examining supply demand as we move forward, the committee has nothing to fear from renewables going up and fossils going down because we will manage the balance through our engineering capability.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned interconnection with France.  Regarding the modelling around the interconnector between Ireland and France, the latter has challenges in Brittany.  It also has challenges because it is going to wind down some of its nuclear power facilities.  It needs renewables.<\/p><p>We are an attractive source of renewables for France through that interconnector.  All of our modelling suggests power will go from Ireland to France more often than France to Ireland.  It will come from France to Ireland at times but the dominant electron flow will be from Ireland to France.  We have both developed a model that assumes that flow.  It is vital for us because if we ratchet up our renewables but then find ourselves at times during the day when there is nowhere to deploy it, the economics of those projects will be challenged and they will not be built.  Developers will not build these projects if they think that they will be turned off 20% of the time and make no money.

As Mr. Donnellan said in his presentation, however, almost 5,000 MW is interconnected.  <\/p><p>This morning, I read with interest the World Energy Outlook on where the world is going.  It was interesting that it said the world needs to go in the direction in which EirGrid is going in terms of the level of capability, variables, renewables, integration, the diselectrification of everything and our prospects.  It gives me great pleasure to say the men and women of EirGrid are climate heroes.  They have done important and internationally significant work on this, the very centre of the clean industrial revolution.  The exciting thing is that we are only starting and that EirGrid needs to proceed confident in its abilities and our abilities as a country to do it.  EirGrid is one of the few examples where we can truly say we are world leaders, and it is not in a insignificant area.  The World Energy Outlook said that what EirGrid is doing is the key to success in decarbonising our energy system, which is why its employees are heroes.  If there was a <i>L&eacute;gion d'Honneur<\/i>, for example, in our country, I would stick it on the breast of every EirGrid executive and worker, and that is from someone who always harangues people before this committee.

In other words, it is about whether we can we meet Ireland's needs first.  Ireland needs thousands of megawatts between now and 2030 if it is to get anywhere near achieving its targets.

We need that level of strategic thinking to indicate to that company straightaway that this is the way we are going to do it.  I would look at the Danish operator, Energinet, as a very good example of how to model interconnection to show the social gains.  That company can, in effect, borrow as the state.  It borrows as a state facility and gets ten year money for next to nothing.  EirGrid should be doing the same and owning the assets down the line.

We have to think about the post-2030 scenario.  If we are serious about where we are going and if this revolution is going to work for north-west Europe, Ireland has a responsibility as a member of the north-west Europe energy market to put 15 GW of offshore wind into the system.  One could do 5 GW in the north-west, 5 GW in the west and 5 in the south-west.  Using HVDC cable technology, the energy could be shipped either through Ireland or around it to the rest of the north-west European electricity market.  Part of this committee's job is to put forward ideas and I am very keen to present the idea of a 15 GW offshore facility.  It is the answer to those who ask why we are not doing oil and gas exploration off the west coast.  As far as I can see, the floating technology is here as is the HVDC cable technology.  I do not know if EirGrid has looked at what the Chinese are doing with their belt and road on HVDC long-distance power distribution, but it is fantastic.  They are way ahead of us and really thinking big in the revolution, as is California.  As one of the world leaders on the very cutting edge of what is happening, why would we not go for 15 GW now?

I am research professor and head of economics and I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Conor O'Toole and Mr. Barra Roantree.<\/p><p> While we have not specifically addressed the impact of Brexit on the Irish housing market, researchers at the institute have examined the impact of Brexit at an aggregate and sectoral level.  We have also built up an extensive research expertise in the area of housing.  As a result, our comments are informed by a considerable body of research.  I will start by summarising the results of some analysis, which has examined the overall impacts of Brexit on the economy.<\/p><p> The macroeconomic effects of Brexit are significant and negative for the economy.  Depending on the nature of the UK's exit from the European Union, Irish output levels could, by 2026, be up to 4% less than a baseline no-Brexit case.  While 4% may not appear to be a significant impact, it has to be borne in mind that this impact will cumulate over a long period.  Therefore, income levels will be lower than otherwise would be the case and unemployment rates will be higher than in a no-Brexit scenario.  In the case of the latter, it has been estimated that under a WTO-style exit, unemployment in the Irish economy could be almost 2 percentage points higher than under a no-Brexit situation.<\/p><p> In the area of housing demand, the impact of Brexit on income levels and unemployment are particularly important.  When we think of the demand side of the housing market, we think of income levels, interest rates, unemployment and demographics as being key fundamental variables.  Across a number of markets, movements in these variables have been shown to be key drivers of house prices.  The impact of Brexit on income levels and the labour market is fairly unambiguous - both are expected to be lower than a no-Brexit scenario. In this respect, housing demand is likely to be lower due to both factors.  The situation in the context of demographics is less clear-cut.  As a result of the fact that Brexit will have an adverse impact on domestic economic activity, it may reduce the number of people coming to work here.  This, again, would reduce the demand for housing and result in lower house price growth relative to a baseline no-Brexit case.  On the other hand, Brexit could result in a large number of people moving to Ireland from the United Kingdom, particularly if there is significant fallout for the financial sector in London.  This could see an increase in the number of people coming to live and work, particularly in Dublin, which would increase housing demand.  Therefore, one could see significant regional differences in the impact of Brexit on the Irish housing market.  The rest of the country may be adversely impacted while the greater Dublin market may be less so.<\/p><p> One other issue worth mentioning in the context of demographics is the potential for what we call increased friction in the relationship between the Irish and UK labour markets.  By friction we mean anything which prevents people from moving and working in one jurisdiction to another.  Traditionally, the UK labour market has operated as a form of safety valve for the Irish economy.  When unemployment starts to increase significantly in the domestic economy, people tend to move to the UK to find employment.  If this becomes harder to do as a result of Brexit, it will increase the scale of negative shocks in the Irish economy.  Therefore, housing demand will experience greater fluctuations than would otherwise be the case.  In terms of the flow of mortgage credit, if financial stability risks in the banking sector materialise following Brexit, this could limit the availability of mortgage financing which could also put downward pressure on prices and subdue demand.<\/p><p> Colleagues at the institute have carried out extensive research on the implications of Brexit for the production processes of Irish firms.  Where this might impact the housing market is in any difficulties Irish firms may have in securing relevant materials and labour from the UK market.  If Brexit causes a significant increase in the cost for Irish firms in securing labour and materials, this will push up the cost of house building domestically with associated implications for prices.  This may also extend to financial sector considerations.  If access to finance for development becomes impaired due to disruptions in financial markets, the flow of financing to commercial real estate development may decline if international equity flows moderate.  Again, this could increase the cost of supply, with prices being pushed up as a result.  Overall, and notwithstanding the particular case of the Dublin market, Brexit may lead to lower levels of housing demand if income and employment effects are considerable and no inward migration boost materialises.  The risks to housing supply are more clearly on the downside.<\/p><p> At this juncture, it is important to note that housing supply levels are considerably lower than structural demand, with our research showing this is most clearly the case for lower-income households.  If Brexit were to result in a lower level of housing supply by the private sector, it is important that the State continues to invest in affordable and social housing.  Brexit-induced reductions in income and employment, or increased inward migration to Dublin, could also have implications for what will soon be the Government&rsquo;s main income-related social housing support for private renters, namely, the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Eligibility for HAP is determined by a family&rsquo;s disposable income, with maximum limits set on the rent that can be covered.  If income and employment growth are slower than anticipated due to Brexit, the numbers of families that qualify for HAP in the coming years will likely be higher than currently expected.<\/p><p>Similarly, if Brexit results in greater migration to Dublin, and therefore results in higher rents, HAP expenditure is likely to be higher than currently anticipated while the rent limits set down by regulations may require more frequent revision.  Those were last revised in March 2017, and rents have increased by 12% in the capital since then.<\/p><p> Regarding market expectations, these changes in the demand and supply side of the market have all been discussed in the context of changes in economic and demographic variables.  However, expectations, both those of consumers and producers, are extremely important in the residential market.  To date, the entire Brexit process has resulted in a marked increase in uncertainty in the economy.  Greater uncertainty typically makes households and firms more cautious in their decision making, therefore, resulting in less activity in a market such as the housing one.  This, again, is likely to result in lower housing demand and supply.<\/p><p> Regarding some legacy issues in the housing market, mortgage arrears is still an issue in the Irish market.  While rates have fallen in recent years due to improved economic circumstances, they are still above European averages.  Key drivers of mortgage arrears are income, employment and house price levels.  As we have already seen, income levels and employment levels are likely to be less than would otherwise be the case, while house price levels will likely grow at a slower pace compared to a no-Brexit situation.  Therefore, the rate of decline in mortgage arrears is likely to slow due to Brexit.  This, in turn, will have implications for the non-performing loan levels on the balance sheets of Irish financial institutions, which will impact their performance as we go forward.<\/p><p> Brexit may slow the extent to which the European Central Bank, ECB, wants to normalise monetary policy.  If Brexit brings about slower growth across the eurozone, this may lead the ECB to moderate the degree to which policy rates are increased.  Lower policy rates are likely to result in domestic mortgage interest rates being lower than what they otherwise would be.  This would improve affordability in the Irish mortgage market as interest rates are a key determinant of affordability.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention.

We in the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, have undertaken research in the area of Brexit and separately in the housing area but, in common with other researchers, we have not examined specifically the possible or likely impact of Brexit on the Irish housing market.  In fact, I could not find any specific research carried out in this area by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, Copenhagen Economics or by any other individual researcher who has assessed the economic impact of Brexit in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To put this in context, we are all aware of the uncertainties about the final shape of a Brexit deal and given that uncertainty, it is extremely difficult to make any projections either on the supply of, or the demand for, housing.  It is surely the case that consumption and income will be negatively impacted, all other things being equal.  An important qualification to make is that in any economic outlook we are looking at the effect, in isolation, of one change, be it Brexit or another factor.  However, other factors also impact on growth and the demand for housing.  We do not know the evolution of the world market.  Many other factors, including the extent to which multinational investment and the state of the domestic economy, can affect and interact with demographics and, thereby, impact on the housing market.  Therefore, it is possible that economic growth could remain at a high level.  Yet we know from the data and evidence of other research that Brexit, in isolation, in all likelihood will have a dampening effect on economic activity.  My point, essentially, is that other factors could outweigh and disguise, in a certain sense, the negative impact of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the housing market, the problem is that, as matters stand, supply is still very inadequate but we also need to reflect on the regional and the compositional aspects of the Irish housing market.  There is a particular issue of excess demand in the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p>Over and above that, the output of apartment dwellings, for example, is relatively very low.  Apartment building is almost entirely a Dublin phenomenon to the extent that it is happening nationally, according to the most recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, data.  This factor makes us somewhat unique in European terms in that we have a very particular composition of housing output, that is, either single housing or housing that is part of a scheme.  In many other European countries apartment living is much more the norm and there is a much greater density of accommodation in large cities.  The point is that Brexit, to the extent that it may impact on inward migration, will increase in all likelihood the demand for rental accommodation, particularly in the greater Dublin area and the other cities.  There are details here on the regional and compositional aspects of the housing market that are crucial.  The important lesson here is to be ready and to be as best prepared as possible.  This underlines the importance of good social policy not only to accelerate the output of new homes but also, over time, to adopt a strategic approach to the housing stock and the composition of housing and also the need to change the insulation of housing, for example, to meet the challenge of climate change and of moving towards a zero-carbon economy.  Therefore, what we would need to be doing anyway if there were no Brexit is all the more the case with the uncertainty and the likely negative impacts of Brexit.<\/p><p> To focus specifically on the demand side for a moment, as already mentioned, it is the combination of household income effects and migration that works on the demand side.  My view is that the net effect will probably be a higher than otherwise expected demand for accommodation arising from Brexit.  We should not exaggerate the likely phenomenon of, for example, UK financial institutions relocating to Dublin or other cities.  This will happen and is happening but it is likely to have a limited impact in the bigger picture.  What is probably more likely to happen is that workers, families and individuals who might have moved to the UK from other parts of the EU will now, other things being equal, move to the Republic of Ireland.  We should also bear in mind that if tariff barriers were to be erected between Ireland, as a member of the EU, and the UK, including of course Northern Ireland, it is quite likely that UK companies would relocate some part of their activity to the Republic of Ireland.  This is exactly what happened in the 1930s if one thinks of companies such as Cadbury that located part of their operations here, in the Irish Free State, behind newly erected tariff barriers.  As an English-speaking country with a common law system, we have certain elements of attraction to multinational companies quite apart from the low headline corporation tax rate of 12.5%.<\/p><p> I will say a quick word about the supply side.  One of the issues in this regard is currency fluctuations and their impact on materials imported by the construction sector.  We also need to bear in mind, however, that the construction sector is a net exporter of goods.  This, too, could be impacted were sterling to depreciate significantly in the months and year after Brexit actually happens.  There has recently been much focus on and discussion about the way in which a customs union could limit or attenuate some of the impacts of Brexit and avoid what people refer to as a hard border, be it in the Irish Sea or on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>We must reflect that it is the non-tariff barriers and the 1,001 regulatory and product standards and inspection issues raised by divergence from the Single Market that will matter more than whether there is a customs union.  People are very much focused on the visible aspect of trade in goods, but there is another issue that is much more difficult to measure that could have an effect on the construction industry.<\/p><p> Brexit really does challenge all areas of economic and social policy, and we need to be vigilant.  We need to do more of what we should be doing already, and this includes a much more ambitious approach to building public housing.  In our research we have proposed a model of cost rental that would provide much more choice and flexibility in the housing market and could be a significant game changer in terms of ending the dominance of the private rental sector or a developer-led model.<\/p><p> I will happily take questions or join the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and submissions.  Last night, I read the submission papers.  While there is a series of risks, we do not know how Brexit will pan out and we simply have no way of knowing, assessing or measuring its likely impact on the housing market and housing system.  Other than highlighting the risks, and both presentations have done so very well, perhaps the discussion the committee really needs to have, knowing that we do not know these things, is on the types of mitigation measures we should argue should be put in place so that, whatever the negative impacts, we are in a better place to deal with them than we are at present.<\/p> <p>  Whatever one thinks about Rebuilding Ireland, and there are members of the committee who are strongly in favour of it and others who are critical of it, the one thing we can say with certainty is it was designed without an eye to the type of issues being raised here today.  Whether we are for or against the plan, we can all agree clearly that something has to change or something has to be added to it to mitigate the measures outlined by the witnesses.  My questions are more about where we go from here.<\/p> <p>  I am working on the assumption that while both public and private sector housing delivery is affected by the negatives, the private sector is clearly far more vulnerable to them.  The increased costs of construction labour will equally affect public and private sector housing output, but the difficulties with credit do not have the same impact on the public sector because it is using Exchequer revenue, Housing Finance Agency funds or European Investment Bank funds.  Likewise, the overall developmental costs in the public sector are much more controlled because it is not as dependent on land prices and developer profit and risk.  Looking at the overall output and quantum of social and affordable public housing, is it fair to say that a key mitigation measure would be to state that the sector is a little bit less at risk and think about increasing over time the output of social and affordable housing delivered on public land with public finance?  This way we might be able to pick up some of the slack that might inevitably come in the private sector because of the concerns that have been outlined.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses have other views on mitigation measures?  There is very little we can do in terms of increased demand.  We remain within the European Union and the free travel area, and whatever happens on that front will happen.  It is the supply side issues that are clearly of concern and anything that makes it more difficult to supply public and private housing is a concern.  Do the witnesses have other ideas or suggestions?  If not, are there avenues they believe the committee could pursue in terms of future considerations to deal with it?<\/p> <p>  In some areas of Government and public policy there have been quite significant discussions and debates about the impacts and, therefore, the mitigation measures.  From what both organisations have said, there seems to have been a bit of a blind spot towards this one.  In fact, it is only something that has come onto the committee's agenda recently, primarily because of the interest of the Chair and others.  Is this really the case?  Is there really very little discussion at public policy fora level or in the organisations' interactions with Government and State agencies?<\/p><p>Have the issues raised by the delegates today not been part of the discussions and, if so, is that a concern?  What can the committee do to try to raise the profile of some of these concerns to ensure that whatever mitigation measures are possible and appropriate are prioritised in terms of how Government and public agencies prepare for Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#S00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Recently, Fr. Peter McVerry stated that he estimates that there are now 500,000 persons living in the State who experience distress on a daily basis on foot of their housing situations.  We are in the middle of the greatest housing crisis this State has known.  Whenever Brexit is discussed we hear much about its impact on jobs, wages and economic growth.  It is not a criticism of the institutes but a criticism of the State that four and a half months from the deadline for Brexit we are still in the dark in terms of the impact it will have on the housing crisis and the people affected by it.  It is not entirely an unknown unknown.  I note with interest that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, have laid emphasis on the fact that an important preparatory measure would be a significant ramping up of the State's investment in social and affordable housing.  This is an important conclusion emanating from the presentations today.<\/p><p>I have two questions for the delegates, the first of which relates to measuring the effect.  It is sometimes possible to measure precisely but at other times it is only possible to measure within a particular range.  In previous discussions on Brexit impacts we have heard it could result in the loss of 20,000 jobs and that in particular sectors it could result in wage cuts of between 5% and 10%.  One report states that it could have a depressing effect on growth of, perhaps, 2%.  Are we in a position to make assessments in terms of key housing indicators?<\/p><p>For example, one of the key impacts pointed to today is an upward pressure on rents, but I am not 100% sure as to the basis for it.  I understand financial industry is relocating here from the UK and that this has a depressing effect on the housing market in terms of more people seeking rental accommodation in that circumstance.  I also have an idea of the reason for an upward pressure on rents but I would like to know if we are in a position to measure it.  Yesterday, <i>Daft.ie<\/i>released data which points to an 11% year-on-year increase in rents nationally.  Are we in a position to state that in a particular Brexit scenario the upward pressure effect on rent is likely to be in the range of 1% to 3%, 3% to 5% or 5% to 10%?  What is the best scenario and what might be the worst?  I accept there is an element of speculation in this regard and that the witnesses might not be prepared to speculate but, perhaps, they would comment on the issue.<\/p><p>My second question relates to the issue of regional variations, which I think both witnesses pointed to as well.<\/p><p>Greater Dublin has been highlighted as an area in which, for obvious reasons, increased upward pressure on rent might be the greatest.  Would our guests be prepared to comment on the effects of Brexit on the housing situation in other areas?  There will be a big difference between the midlands and west of Ireland as opposed to some of the larger cities outside Dublin.  I refer to Galway in the west, Limerick in the mid-west and Cork in the south-west.  Would our guests be prepared to comment on the likely effects on those cities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#T00200","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barry and call Dr. McQuinn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#U00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542106800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Those were relevant questions.  I agree with the point made by Dr. Healy on the mitigation strategy, which was one of the first issues raised.  There clearly are structural issues in the housing market regardless of Brexit.  We are all familiar with them.  We have an issue with the structural demand for housing.  As we have estimated it at somewhere in the region of 25,000 units to 30,000 units are required each year.  This year, however, we are only likely to build in the region of 18,000 units.  That is not just a year-on-year issue.  It has been accumulating over many years, unfortunately, and is a significant issue.  For the past three or four years, we observed the marked slowdown in the number of social housing units being provided and that there was an urgent need to address that.  Unfortunately, that issue also accumulated over a number of years and it is not something that can be addressed in any one year, unfortunately.  It will take years.<\/p> <p>  On mitigation, we pointed out that if there is a reduction in private development, or the number of units coming from the private sector, then, ideally, the State would be in a position to step in and escalate the level of housing supply it is providing.  That is the desired outcome.  The only issue with this - and something we have to mention - is that Brexit is also going to have an impact on the public finances, which is ultimately what is going to fund the increased provision of social housing.<\/p> <p>  If Brexit has a significantly adverse impact on the public finances - as it more than likely will if there is a very dramatic Brexit, such as a no-deal Brexit or even a World Trade Organisation-style Brexit - then that will impact on the public coffers.  The public coffers, in turn, are where the extra funding for housing would come from.  That has to be taken into consideration as well.  As already stated, ideally, the State would be in a position to step in a countercyclical fashion and be able to boost and increase the rate of housing supply.  That is, therefore, one consideration to raise in respect of that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Would that also equally affect borrowing by the State from the Housing Finance Agency and the European Investment Bank, EIB, or would it be predominantly on the revenue expenditure side?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#U00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542106800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>It would probably be on the revenue expenditure side.  I had not thought of it in respect of other ways.  It is something that has to be borne in mind in respect of the likely future path of the key fiscal metrics such as the deficit, the debt to gross domestic product, GDP, and the gross national income (Star), GNI*, metrics.  It is something that would have to be taken into consideration.  We would also note that, while calling for increased expenditure on social housing - and there was a significant increase in the last year in the recent budget - there is also the additional problem with the economy growing at a very strong rate.  A balancing act has to be achieved.  We do not want to overheat the economy with the State spending a particularly large amount and increasing the level of expenditure.  Those are two risks in this context.  The point is well made in general, however, that, ideally, if the State can increase its provision of housing, where there is a slowdown in the private sector, I think that would be a desired outcome.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the issue of whether we would have expected more on this in respect of dealing with policymakers, in general, we are a little surprised.  We carried out the initial macroeconomic assessment using the range of models we use to perform analysis.  I referred to the results at the start and there have not been more since then.<\/p><p>In part we can blame the lack of concrete policy proposals from the negotiations, by which everybody has been struck.  There has been very little in the way of tangible and realistic policy proposals that have emerged and which we could consider.  On Deputy Barry's point, it is something at which we certainly could look.  We have the models to examine house prices and housing supply, as well as the impact of reducing income levels and higher employment rates.  We did an extensive amount of work recently in considering affordability across the property market and could factor in those issues in looking at the implications for affordability if income levels fall, unemployment rates increase or even if there is some impact, for example, on interest rates.  We can certainly answer such questions right now, although it is difficult off the top of my head to indicate specific impacts on the key variables.<\/p><p> If there is a no-deal Brexit and the United Kingdom simply crashes out of the European Union, we will have to hold up our hands and say it will be very difficult.  Economic models have strengths, but often they are estimated in periods of relative calm and stability.  We are used to answering such questions in that context.  When we get into a position that nobody has anticipated or there is a dramatic series of events where British aeroplanes cannot land on the Continent or the ports are closed, for example, economic models will not be very relevant.  That is an extreme set of circumstances that I hope will not come to pass.<\/p><p> A relevant point was made about the rest of the country and Brexit.  Colleagues of ours in the institute specifically examined regional matters.  It is work by Dr. Martina Lawless and Professor Edgar Morgenroth.  The different sectoral implications of Brexit are very significant and the agricultural and related food processing sector will be particularly affected, especially if there is a scenario involving rules akin to those used under the World Trade Organization.  In that case, it is interesting to examine the areas of the country that are very heavily reliant on agricultural income and the agriculture sector.  As we know, the south west is very heavily reliant on agriculture, including places such as north Cork, south Tipperary and across that part of the world.  These areas and regions are likely to see a particular impact, as well as Border locations because of their heavy reliance on cross-Border trade, of which agricultural trade is a part.  There could well be key regional differences.<\/p><p> We made the point in the opening statement that, overall, there could be a depressing effect on the national housing market if there were particularly high levels of inward migration to Dublin because of issues related to the financial sector in London or elsewhere in the United Kingdom, for example.  There could be anomalies whereby the Dublin market would be quite different in terms of the overall impact versus the rest of the housing market outside Dublin.  It would probably stretch to the cities generally, including Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  The impact for those cities would be somewhat different from that in the surrounding regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542106800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I will pick up on two points from Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions that are relevant to the work we are doing.  First, I reinforce Dr. McQuinn's comments in that the research we published earlier in the summer in considering housing affordability made it clear that the issues in the housing market were structural, relatively speaking, rather than cyclical.  It is particularly important as Brexit would be a cyclical shock, although it might change some of the structural economic relationships.  What we have seen from the financial crisis to now is generalised under-provision of social and affordable housing in the economy.  What we have been calling for in a number of our economic commentaries is a long-term structural commitment to providing a very large layer of social and affordable housing.  That is not a cyclical matter.  It is very clear when we consider the data.  For example, the study indicates that in the private rental sector households in the bottom 25% of income distribution spend, on average, 50% of net income on housing.<\/p><p>It is quite a heavy burden on those types of households.  Then, we get a big shock like Brexit and we are asking whether our suite of policies are fit for purpose in terms of mitigation strategies.  Certainly, having a suite of housing delivery solutions that is invariant to the economic cycle allows one to have a buffer that allows one to manage these things.  As Dr. McQuinn has said, we are well below the structural demand levels in terms of the number of completions.  If we see that slowing again, if the private sector faces heightened credit constrains or other difficulties, then the State can step in and, possibly, ramp up its activity to ensure that we provide this component of the market, which is critically important.<\/p><p> An area of information that is relevant to understanding how Brexit may have a direct impact on the housing market is the supply chains in the construction sector, and whether particular products may be more affected relative to others.  Let us consider, for example, some of the information from the CSO this morning, particular regarding types of product groupings such as plumbing or electrical fittings and prefabricated buildings.  Nearly 50% of our imports of these types of products come from the UK.  There may be vulnerabilities in specific product areas that may make disruptions to the supply chain greater in housing than in other areas.  We have not done detailed research work on that aspect it is something that could be examined in a lot more detail.  The reliance on wood and wood products from the UK is quite high at about 30%.  These are structural trading relationships that will come to the fore in terms of trying understand the impact of Brexit.  For example, if there was a heightened tariff regime, there is the question of what would be the likely impact on these types of products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542106800,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I will first deal with the regional question.  As already stated, there is likely to be a stronger negative impact outside Dublin and this also will impact on small and medium-sized enterprises.  The agrifood sector, in particular, could be very severely impacted with aggregate job losses being significantly higher than 20,000.  I refer to the multiplier effect in this regard, not just in the Border area and the north west, but in the south west and south east, where many enterprises are heavily UK-orientated and would be very adversely affected, particularly in the dairy and beef sector.<br\/><br\/>Brexit is challenging but Dublin may do well out of Brexit.  There is an upside to Brexit but it is much more likely to be concentrated in the bigger cities, particularly Dublin.<br\/><br\/>With Brexit there is a greater risk of social and economic inequality.  For example, the demand for low-skilled workers could be affected, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the supply of low-skilled workers.  Wage inequality could increase if there was higher unemployment in particular sectors and among particular low-skilled categories of workers.  There would be a social impact immediately.<br\/><br\/>We have not touched on another important regional issue of which we are very conscious as an all-island research body.  The impact regionally on Northern Ireland will be worse than in any other UK region.  That will have spillover impacts, particularly in Border areas, but also in the construction sector because there are very close ties between the construction sectors in the South and North.  At the moment there is a certain degree of migration of labour taking place and one can see it in some of the new developments that are taking place in and around Dublin.  The impact on the construction sector will, possibly, be quite severe and we cannot underestimate the potential for inward migration and businesses in the North relocating to the Republic.  We must also be concerned about the impact on housing and on the general economy and society of Northern Ireland as a region that is closely allied to the Republic.<\/p><p>As for measurement issues, we were asked whether we were surprised there had been so little analysis in the construction and housing area.  I do not think so.  The work undertaken in 2015 by the ESRI tells us pretty much what we need to know about the larger possible economic impact of Brexit.  Let us remember that it was done before the Brexit referendum.  The Copenhagen Economics study of February 2018 does not say a great deal more than had already been signalled in the 2015 exercise.  While it is true that nothing specific has been done on housing and construction in any of the larger studies and that is certainly a gap, the difficulty there is that we do not really know how this is going to shake out in terms of inward investment and migration.  The CSO has projected population figures on various assumptions with migration ranging from 10,000 net inward migrants per annum up to a maximum of 30,000 net inward migrants per annum to the year 2030.  Those are probably conservative estimates or assumptions and we could be looking at much higher effects.  One final point to bear in mind is that public services broadly will be impacted, including education and health.  It is not just housing.  All of these factors are, of course, interrelated.<\/p><p> The question of how to be ready falls to be addressed.  There are two different approaches or emphases which can be adopted here.  Groups like the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and the ESRI underline the importance of prudence, in particular fiscal prudence because of the uncertainties around Government revenue in light of any slowdown.  However, our emphasis is a little different and is on the importance of ramping up investment, which is to say targeted, quality investment in key areas.  I give a practical example.  If one wants to order a kitchen from Germany, the chances are that the bits and pieces will be transported across the English landbridge.  We have to think about Cork Port, Waterford's Belview Port, which is connected by rail, and Rosslare, which is a roll-on, roll-off facility.  We have to think about the hard infrastructure to facilitate trade to move more freely.  We must also get out of fossil fuels more quickly than planned because a major proportion of our crude oil and gas comes through the UK.  We must be mindful of the need to take action on climate issues in any case.

Over the years, the ESRI, as an independent, professional body, has been on the button in terms of informing public policy as well as advising the Government and the Opposition.<\/p> <p>  Despite the appalling vista it presents, Brexit also gives us the opportunity to change significant policies, particularly with regard to housing.  Our guests have made the point that the provision of social and affordable housing should always be a constant and that whatever need exists should be met.  As the market changes, Government spending on social and affordable housing should increase.  The figure for this year is around 18,000 units which is expected to reach 20,000 next year and 25,000 from 2020 onwards.  Notwithstanding the fact that this will not be enough, our guests are identifying a key policy issue on which we can all agree, namely that there must be a model for building social housing as a constant.  That must always happen, regardless of the climate.<\/p> <p>  In the 1930s and the 1950s, significant numbers of very fine, solid local authority houses were built.  These houses are still in use today.  Economics were very bad at that time and we had an enormous national debt.  What was the model at that time?  Did the ESRI or the Nevin Economic Research Institute look at that?  Are there lessons to be learned from what was done during that period?<\/p> <p>  The North will suffer more than any other part of the island after Brexit.  In terms of the regional development policy and Project Ireland 2040 attention must focus on the Sligo, Letterkenny, Derry axis and the Drogheda, Dundalk, Belfast economic corridor axis.  Government investment which is planned for these two regions must be fast tracked because they will suffer the most.  In terms of job migration, there is some evidence in County Louth that jobs may migrate from Northern Ireland to that county.  I know of two pharmaceutical companies that are considering such a move.  There will be job losses in the North because companies that want to invest in Europe that were considering the UK will now look elsewhere, possibly to our benefit.  This is particularly true of US companies or those companies that are English language-based and that want to access the European market.  That said, most Europeans are very competent and speak English as well as we do.  Are there policy change options available in this context?  Are there opportunities for us in that area?  <\/p> <p>  A key point is the political instability that could result from depressed economic circumstances.  There will also be a requirement for increased vigilance in the context of tax collection.  We will need to focus on cross-Border relationships and those towns and cities that straddle the Border including Sligo, Letterkenny, Derry, Dundalk, Drogheda and Newry.  These areas will be key in terms of future stability.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the difficulties to which Brexit will give rise, North and South, there is a case to be made to the European Union that it must recognise the disproportionately negative economic impact on Ireland relative to other member states.  We must consider specific issues such as the cost of housing, including that part of it relating to materials and so on.<\/p><p>If the State is paying the cheque the EU, through the European Investment Bank or whatever other route, must recognise our increasing disadvantage in terms of addressing key issues arising from Brexit.  There has to be a benefit to Ireland above and beyond what we would normally get and the EU must recognise that in our housing, economic and employment policies.<\/p><p> They are the main issues I see.  What is happening in Britain at the moment is appalling.  When one reads the newspaper, in some cases one sees demagogues appearing on the political stage, and not just in America.  Some are beginning to appear in our own country.  The stability that is essential for our economic well-being and our democracy will not be improved by Brexit.

I am grateful for the opportunity to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#Y00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I will be brief as I am conscious of the time.  I have a few comments to make and two questions to ask.  I thank the panel for coming in.  All of us in this room know that we have a housing crisis.  I was very interested in the comments of Dr. Healy, Dr. O'Toole and Dr. McQuinn.  They all referred, in a very interesting and pointed way, to the delivery of social housing.  That was very interesting because it is not something we always hear, yet here we have general consensus and agreement on it.  I will not go as far as to say they were critical, but in some ways their remarks were very pointed.  It will be interesting to look back over and read the transcript of this meeting because I believe the witnesses were spot on.  I welcome their comments.  The reality, as we all know, is that we need to be building or rolling out approximately 30,000 houses.  Someone said that earlier on.  Nothing less will make any real or significant difference.  The reality, as we know, is that there is a crisis in social housing, affordable housing and in both private and public housing.  There is very little public housing.  The situation is improving but there is very little.  It is simply not good enough.  We are not building enough public, social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  Where does all that fit into our deliberations today?  We are of course focusing on the impact of Brexit on the housing market so I want to keep my comments to that issue.  It is important that we acknowledge that Brexit will have a very significant impact on our economy.  It will affect jobs, budgetary constraints and employment.  It is going to affect an awful lot of things.  From what I have seen in both papers, I would suggest, and Dr. Healy possibly suggested this in his paper, that while this demand will be felt in many ways, there will also be opportunities.  There are potentially many opportunities for Dublin and the east coast, but Brexit will also impact on Dublin, where the housing crisis is greatest in terms of the delivery and building of social and affordable housing, the purchase of private housing, and every other aspect of people's accommodation and housing.  We already have major demand and now we will have this impact.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Healy suggests in his paper that, all things being equal, Brexit will possibly boost foreign direct investment into the Republic and, with that, inflows of personnel which will generate greater demand for housing, including rented accommodation.  I welcome any opportunity that Brexit brings because in every crisis there is an opportunity.  I welcome the opportunities on which we can capitalise in terms of inward investment and inward migration.  That has to be positive.  We have to be ready and prepared to seize that opportunity.  The crisis will be in accommodating these people and providing them with homes and housing.  That is the real challenge.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask two questions.  Dr. O'Toole talked about the construction industry.  He mentioned that and picked up on it in previous comments.  Has either organisation done an in-depth analysis in respect of the construction industry and the impacts on it in terms of bringing in product and labour and all the issues associated with that?  The two questions I want to ask specifically, and which I ask the two organisations to address specifically, are as follows.  What challenges will the construction industry face following Brexit according to their projections and analysis of the situation?  What potential effects, if any, will Brexit have on the movement of construction materials between Ireland and the UK and, for that matter, the rest of the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#Z00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I will be fairly brief.  I will try to speak specifically about housing, as opposed to the broader economic implications of Brexit.  The one thing that is coming through is uncertainty.  None of us knows exactly what we are headed for.  The other word I have used in the context of Brexit is \"stability\".  Stability is required in all markets if we are going to try to get out of this.  Reports have identified that while other areas of Ireland might be exposed in the broader Brexit situation, the areas that are currently facing a significant housing crisis - Dublin and surrounding areas, and possibly other city-centre locations - will be further exposed by a bad Brexit.  The supply of materials and skills in and out of the country is an issue in the housing sector in the context of Brexit, just as it is an issue in all sectors of society.  It has been clear in my mind for some time that there is a need for the State to take greater control of the delivery of social and affordable housing, and this view has been confirmed here.  We need to reduce our reliance on the private sector to deliver such housing.  As we take that into account, we must equally acknowledge that a bad Brexit will cause our economy to contract.  In such circumstances, the Government will not have the fiscal space to deliver on the need for social and affordable housing.  This brings me back to the cost-rental model, which was mentioned by Dr. Healy when he was before this committee previously. For once and for all, the State has to find an off-balance sheet model that can deliver social and affordable housing for this country now and moving into the future.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the fiscal space and the off-balance sheet model.  I believe we can create a sustainable model as we move forward by using the cost-rental model or a differential model with a top-up from the State.  The only way the State is going to fix the housing crisis is to take greater control of the housing sector, as opposed to allowing it to be dealt with by the private market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#AA00100","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I understand Senator Murnane O'Connor is under pressure for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#AA00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I will keep it very short.  I thank the Chair.  I think everything has been said.  I want to thank our guests for their reports.  There is uncertainty.  We are really no further on than we were this time last year.  I think we are nearly looking at a backstop.  We are getting very good reports.  The uncertainty is caused by the lack of evidence of what will happen in the long term.  People are really concerned.  These reports refer to local authority housing, but we know that such housing is not being built at a national level.  The Minister comes in every few weeks to tell us that there is plenty of money for housing.  Ultimately, there is so much confusion.  All the reports we are receiving are welcome.  We have spoken about farmers and exports in the context of Brexit, but we must also speak about businesses and housing.  People are living longer.  As we build houses, we are not able to cater for what had before Brexit.  Please God Brexit will not happen.  We cannot even handle what we have, let alone what we hope will not happen.  That is my concern.<\/p> <p>  I attended a public meeting last night.  Many elderly people who spoke at the meeting feel their needs are not being met through local authorities because not enough houses are being built.  No two-bedroom houses are being built.  No houses are being built for people with disabilities.  We have to look at insulation.  All of these issues, which are of concern now, are affected by the uncertainty of Brexit.  What are the answers?  We can do as many reports as we want.  They are all welcome.  Are there any reports that tell us what the answers will be if Brexit happens?  All of the uncertainty is causing people to ask where we will go if Brexit happens.  What plan of action do we have in place?  It has been suggested that Brexit could have a good effect on mortgages because interest rates could drop.  That is welcome, in a sense.<\/p><p>However, the approach is based on the situation in cities and rural Ireland is being completely forgotten.  The approach is always based on Dublin.  Although I acknowledge that homelessness is a far bigger issue in Dublin and other cities than in rural Ireland, the other areas of the country must be considered.  All of the reports are based on cities such as Dublin, but rural Ireland is forgotten.  We must eliminate the uncertainty of people across the country by ensuring that consideration is had for all areas, rather than only looking at cities.  <\/p><p>Dr. Healy stated that Brexit could have a big impact on cities.  What will its impact be on rural Ireland?  The witnesses have put forward very interesting figures.  What will the repercussions be for rural Ireland and its people?  I ask for clarity on measures that may be of assistance to the people of Ireland post Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#AA00300","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1542106800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542106800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Rural Ireland faces huge challenges apart from Brexit, such as the imminent closure of certain peat or coal-burning stations and the related impact on the midlands, as well as the position in respect of Moneypoint in County Clare, which will cause the loss of a significant number of jobs and will have a serious impact on the local communities.  The extent of one-off housing and the reliance on solid or fossil fuel heating in many parts of rural Ireland are noticeable.  Car dependency is a huge issue.  The majority of those living in rural Ireland depend on a car to get to and from key services, shops and workplaces.  Brexit is another reason for us to invest in public transport and the reskilling of some workers who are facing job losses whether Brexit goes ahead or not.  The creation and loss of jobs is always a feature of economic change but there is currently an imbalance in Ireland in that regard.<\/p> <p>  A development bank for the north west of Europe is an important proposal in terms of economic change and Brexit.  In the context of negotiating a Brexit transition and to deal with job losses and some of the issues raised by the Senator relating to the rural areas of Ireland, a development bank modelled on the KfW bank in Germany would lend and advise and help SMEs to re-orientate their activities and undertake new ones.  Such activities could initially involve a radical retrofitting of more than half a million houses, many of which are in rural areas and badly insulated, to take advantage of the current technological possibilities in terms of solar and wind power.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked for a summary of construction-related impacts.  It is likely that there will be higher costs, a possible temporary shortage of materials and continuing pressure on skills, which will probably be worsened by some of these adjustments.  We do not know whether the availability of skilled labour from Northern Ireland will be assured post Brexit.  The net effect will probably be greater demand, although it will be dampened by economic slowdown in some sectors.  That gives further credence to the importance of a European cost-rental model, which would provide greater choice, security, affordability and quality accommodation both to those in need of social housing and to all income groups.  Mixed income groups living in public housing and that being done off balance sheet would not solve all of our problems but it is one important way of solving the housing crisis.<\/p><p>Doing it off balance sheet is one way.

There is a whole set of reasons that can limit the ability of local authorities and approved housing bodies to build.  One of the aspects that has been highlighted by Michelle Norris of UCD, among others, is the fact that rents received by councils are often extremely low in a lot of counties because they are capped by the differential rent scheme in a county.  Maybe this is in the background but it interacts a lot with how to get approved housing bodies or local authorities to be able to finance housing.  If their revenue stream is very restricted by a very low capped rent, they will not be able to raise the finance themselves.  If the rents do not even cover the cost of maintenance, it will be difficult to get them to invest and it reduces their incentives in that regard.  That is one set of issues that fall under the committee's remit in terms of looking to see if something can be done with the differential rent schemes that operate around the country currently.  Perhaps the schemes are not particularly coherent across counties.  The definition of \"income\" differs a lot and the ways in which people's means are assessed for the schemes can differ wildly.  This is probably the one thing that often falls under the radar but is important when we are thinking of ways to build the finance model that can sustain housing throughout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barra Roantree"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Could I ask a question to clarify a point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#CC00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>The Senator can ask the question later on because Deputy Darragh O'Brien and the Chairman, Deputy Bailey, still have to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#CC00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to the comment.

That has been the practice for as long as I have been in the House since 2007.  Senator Boyhan's contribution probably points to a bigger issue with the presentations and the discussion we are having.  I apologise for not being here for the presentations but I read both presentations yesterday.  I wanted to come in to discuss some issues.  The papers we have here are housing papers that mention Brexit, as opposed to being Brexit papers on housing.  Dr. Healy has highlighted some very valid issues with regard to housing policy, housing delivery and the type of housing models.  If one was to remove the word \"Brexit\" from Dr. Healy's submission these issues would still be pertinent whether Brexit was happening or not.  That is not a criticism.  It shows the crossover in terms of us trying to grapple with what would be the specific effects on the housing sector based on Brexit but especially a hard Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The presentation by the Economic and Social Research Institute gave some specifics around what it sees as the increase in unemployment based on a hard Brexit or a no-deal scenario, which is around 2%.  I disagree with other Senators present who say there are opportunities here.  Any opportunities from Brexit are far outweighed by the negative impacts of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  On both submissions, I wonder why one aspect was not mentioned.  We are supposed to be talking specifically about housing, and perhaps the witnesses addressed this in reply to the questions.  The common travel area will endure, whatever happens.  With regard to the risk to labour one the submissions referred to the UK being used as a valve to switch on or off, depending on economics.<\/p><p>Even if we consider what has been discussed between the European Union and Britain about the reciprocal rights of British and EU citizens, I am not sure why that plays such a prominent role in both of the submissions.  I do not understand why the common travel area, CTA, is not mentioned if we are talking about a threat to the workforce from the North.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.<\/p><p> On the all-Ireland electricity market, the east-west interconnector is a major piece of infrastructure for delivering energy security.  As such, it will be important for new and existing homes.  Again, I do not see any reference to the interconnector or the North-South energy market in either submission.<\/p><p> On the increasing cost of building, we know the issues that arise in this regard and Dr. Healy, Mr. O'Toole, Professor McQuinn and Mr. Roantree addressed them.  On the issue of a potential increase in the cost of materials, has either of the institutes done work on what level of material is imported from Britain?  Is the issue that material comes via the British landbridge or that we are overly dependent on British material for building products?  That is a building-specific Brexit issue on which the witnesses may have information and, if so, perhaps they will share it.  I have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister asking whether the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has a housing specific contingency plan in place based on a difficult Brexit scenario.  The answers indicate it does not have such a plan in place.  That issue is a difficult one to grapple with because we are in a housing crisis.<\/p><p> Many of the issues raised in the submissions would be valid regardless of whether Brexit happens.  For this reason, I am trying to find out what the Brexit-specific pieces are, for example, what is our dependence on the British market for building, expressed in percentage values, be that through material, personnel, energy security or fuel imports?  Dr. Healy referred to fuel and I know our dependence on gas imports reduced as a result of the Corrib gas project.  Renewable energy was also mentioned.<\/p><p> This is not a criticism.  I am just trying to get under the bonnet because we are a housing committee.  The witnesses mentioned housing issues that we are already dealing with.

Let us consider what could happen from a day-to-day perspective if there is a hard Brexit.  The direct trading supply chain links would be disrupted.  It is difficult to know the degree of disruption because it would depend on the tariff arrangements in place and whatever deal or no-deal scenario came to pass.  It would also depend on what non-tariff barriers, including regulatory alignment or types of standard, would be required between the two jurisdictions following the deal.

There is a considerable reliance on these types of structure that are building and construction oriented.<\/p> <p>  Some other risks should be pointed to.  If construction firms face difficulties in the credit market in raising capital or financing in a post-Brexit environment, that could be a particular constraint on their typical ability to deliver units.<\/p> <p>  There is a related financing point relevant to the mortgage market.  If the banking sector is hit by a material financial stability risk, those involved may have to pull back on some of their lending activities.  That would affect construction firms and the demand side of the housing market if mortgage availability were to reduce.  I know that some of the Irish banks have large activities in the United Kingdom and they could be exposed to some of the major financial stability risks in that context.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to comment on a basket of points raised by Deputies O'Dowd and Casey about the model for delivery of particular types of unit of social housing.  One thing we have learned from the crisis and in thinking about the types of policy that are appropriate is that there is a need to have a system that can react whenever shocks occur.  It is important not to have a particular over-reliance on one delivery solution.  For example, let us consider the work of the local authorities, approved housing bodies and other models of private sector cost rental or for the delivery of cost rental units.  They all have to be part of a basket of solutions to have a healthy functioning market that can withstand shocks and downturns, whether they are Brexit-related or others.  Certainly, the research we published in June suggests having a range of delivery mechanisms is the most appropriate for any market to function well.  When we have a shock like Brexit and the problems are exacerbated in the requirements for housing, we can withstand it better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#EE00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor O'Toole"},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Can one of the delegates comment on the energy question?

The electricity issue and the energy issue in general were explicitly dealt with in a paper by John FitzGerald and Edgar Morgenroth.  I will make two brief responses, the first of which relates to the common travel area and labour.  Again, the question was explicitly dealt with in that work.<\/p><p>There were four or five chapters, one of which considered the overall macro issue.  Then there were the sub-sectors on issues such as energy and labour.  The crucial fact about the labour market is that we are used to a highly fluid relationship between the UK and Ireland.  That is how economists typically referred to it over the years.  Regardless of whether we like it, the UK has acted as a kind of safety valve when we have had particularly bad economic shocks and, as happened in 2009 and 2010, unemployment rates escalated sharply.  People then moved to the UK.  That puts a cap on the degree of unemployment we witness in the domestic market.  If that is in any way impeded, if there are any frictions that prevent people from moving back and forth and if that safety valve does not operate to the same extent, the scale or magnitude of the shock will be greater in the domestic market than it would otherwise be.<\/p><p> Very few people have inquired in great detail as to what is the most efficient, cost-effective way of delivering a certain number of social housing units.  That should be analysed.  If we have learned anything over the past ten years, it is that we really need to guarantee, however it is done - whether by the State, through local authorities, etc. - that a certain number of units are built every year.  The problem that arises is that when that breaks down over several years we end up with this big backlog of a problem which will require a lot of money to be spent in order to resolve the problem, and we have to be careful about how and when that money is spent.  That is the number one lesson.  We are not alone in this; the UK has also had this problem.  We spoke to colleagues from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research recently.  The problem in the UK in the 1980s when they sold off the public housing stock, which was positive for many of the households concerned, was that this stock was not replenished and that led to a decline in the amount of public housing.  There have been long-standing problems in the UK market as a result.  Other economies have had this difficulty.  We need to heed the lessons to be learned in this regard.  When we were building crazy numbers of houses in 2005 and 2006 - with 70,000 or 80,000 units per annum - one of the ways we thought we would deliver social housing was the notion that a certain percentage would be provided by the private market.  It is fine to provide 10% of 80,000 units if that number is being built.  However, the model collapses when the private sector is building practically no units.  It is very important that we have a mixed response in order that it is more robust to withstand economic shock, but there must be some underlying guarantee that the State will provide a certain number of housing units year in year out.  That withstands most economic shocks that occur.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Dowd asked about opportunities from Brexit.  This work was done by Ron Davies of UCD and a colleague of ours, Iulia Siedschlag, as part of a scoping out exercise or a subsequent analysis on FDI inward flows that may arise.  They noted some increase in inward flows of FDI as a result of Brexit but overall that did not outweigh the negative aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#EE00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542106800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>To address the question about the common travel area, the honest answer is that I do not know because we have three interfaces here, with Northern Ireland, between this island and the next island, Great Britain, and with the Continent.  When we factor in all the proposed backstops and the fact that one of the major reasons was concern about migration, this does not add up.  Something has got to give somewhere.  If we have a common travel area with the next island, we will not have a common travel area with the Continent.<\/p><p>If there is a common travel area around the frontier of the European Union, there will have to be controls at the border between the North and the South.  Something has to give somewhere and it will impact on workers coming into the South every day to work on building sites and developments who can be seen on the M1 motorway and in other places.  There is another land bridge about which we have not talked.  It is the road from Aughnacloy to Strabane, known as the A5.  Our fellow citizens in northern Donegal are connected by a slender slice of EU territory south of Bundoran.  It is a serious point for people living and working there.  Many people living in County Donegal work in Derry and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It is similar in many other areas along the Border.  There are major unanswered questions, to which not even the British Cabinet, as it meets tomorrow, has definitive answers.  It will take many years for all of this to unravel.  Politically, the only way to move forward is to develop a sufficiently broad fudge in order that enough people will be on board to get it over the line in 27 parliaments, plus the British Parliament.<br\/><br\/>There is then the question of the Belfast Agreement.  There is no mention of economics in the Good Friday Agreement because it was just assumed that the European Union would make everything possible in terms of markets, convergence and movement towards an all-island economy, but Brexit has changed everything.  The Good Friday Agreement is not the same, or at least it is not premised in the same way as it was in 1998.<br\/><br\/>Someone asked what we should prioritise.  We should prioritise education, skills, retraining and investment in public transport.  I mentioned ports, but we also need to get our fossil fuel import dependency rate down quickly, from the current 85% to something much lower, because we are very vulnerable.  We cannot put all of our eggs in one basket.  An interconnector to France would help, but that is not going to happen any time soon.  We have to look at native sources of renewable energy to replace some of the external dependency. <br\/><br\/>There are lots of challenges and unknowns.  I wish I could provide more certainty on some of these estimates, but we are dealing with a very fast moving situation.  In addition to all of this, of course, Brexit is only one thing that is changing.  We have climate change, geopolitics and a possible breakdown of the multilateral trade system; all of which will probably matter more than Brexit in the long term.  We are talking about one of many challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111300002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542106800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending.

What links them is how skills are formed in an economy and whether we make them or buy them in.  There are provisions for work permits in the high and low skill sectors of the economy, but it is in the latter that controversy most often arises.  There must be a balance between the desire of some employers to recruit people with additional skills and the desire of others to depress wages.  According to a memorandum from an interdepartmental group, where employees on work permits are working for relatively low rates of pay, it will tend to set rates and conditions for other workers in the same occupations and sectors.<\/p> <p>  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the quarter 1 vacancy rate this year was 1.1%, an increase on the 0.5% rate in 2011 but still far below rates prevailing in mainland Europe.  The highest job vacancy rates in quarter 2 of 2018 were recorded in the Czech Republic, at 5.4%; Belgium, at 3.5%; the Netherlands, at 3.1%, and Germany, at 2.9%.   EUROSTAT recorded Ireland as having a stable job vacancy rate.  There may be skills shortages in selected areas, but we are a long way from labour shortages.   In its 2017 bulletin report the skills and labour market research unit of SOLAS which is pretty much the gold standard in terms of research in this area, states that while there are shortages in a number of occupations across all sectors of the economy, many of them are small in magnitude and in particular niche areas in which a number of years' experience is required.  It is important to bear in mind that while there may be, for example, a shortage of engineers, the positions will not necessarily be filled by people just out of University College Dublin, UCD, Trinity College Dublin, TCD, or the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, in Bolton Street as they require engineers with experience.  There is a shortage of engineers pretty much worldwide.<\/p> <p>  There are still 240,000 people on the live register and 17 million unemployed in the EU27.  The latter are reachable through the EURES service, but employers make insufficient use of it.  The JobPath programme is aimed at Irish residents who are long-term unemployed.  The Government has paid out more that &euro;100 million in the last two years to the two JobPath contractors, Seetec and Turas Nua, which operate north and south of the line running from Dublin to Galway.  Bringing in a large number of non-EEA nationals on wages at or just above the minimum wage would be counter to the objectives of the programme.  We need to examine pathways towards regularisation for people who are perhaps here irregularly.  A large number of people have come to this country on student visas to learn English.  Some have overstayed their visas and remained in the country illegally.  A programme has recently been introduced, opening a path to regularisation.  We need to evaluate the operation of the programme, with a view to introducing other targeted regularisation initiatives.  One possible criterion that might be used is the possession of a QQI certificate in a work related discipline.  Strangely, a person might be in this country illegally as far as one of the arm of the State, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, is concerned, but he or she has been through the system and obtained a QQI certificate through another arm of the State.  There may be potential to have a regularisation pathway in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the question of work permits, we need to learn from mistakes and make policy on the basis of calm evaluation, not news bites.  The committee has a good track record in this area.  A little less than a year ago it published a report on the operation of atypical schemes in the fishing sector, describing the harrowing tales of exploitation about which it had heard in the course of its work.  The same mistakes must not be repeated in other sectors.<\/p> <p>  On apprenticeships, the development of new apprenticeships has been underpinned by a broad degree of consensus among the various players.  The most recent statistical update given to the D&aacute;il in the week beginning 25 October is now outdated on the basis of responses given to questions last week.  The SOLAS website lists 41 apprenticeships currently on offer.  Of these, over one third, or 14, are of the new generation of apprenticeships.  There are a further 11 apprenticeships in development and a greater number in pre-development stage.  Apprenticeships were traditionally at level six, but of the newer generation of apprenticeships, seven of the 14 are at level 7, or ordinary degree level, or 8, honours degree level.  An example in that regard is the industrial engineering apprenticeship currently provided in Limerick Institute of Technology.  The programme seeks to address the shortage of electrical engineers at level 7 or 8 by providing a pathway for existing electricians at level 6 to upgrade to level 7.  The attraction for the apprentices is career progression, while for the sponsoring companies it is the opportunity is to grow their engineer talent with people who have a proven track record in the company.  <\/p> <p>  New apprenticeship sectors have developed in biopharma, property services, ICT, finance and logistics.  In addition, new apprenticeships have been developed in the electrical and mechanical areas.  The number of new apprentices, as a percentage of total apprenticeships, has grown from 2% in 2016 to 10% in 2018.  This will lead to a greater number of women apprentices.  In the process of recruitment of apprentices, in which I have been involved for over a decade, everything revolves around the CAO dates, particularly the date of offers.  It is anticipated that the concept of \"earn while you learn\" will catch on among young people.  It is hoped the expansion of apprenticeships will help to address the problem of dropout and completion rates in the third level sector.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the question of skills, people will seek to enter occupations that provide good wages and progression rates.  They will tolerate low wages while learning in order to have long-term access to knowledge and skills, but they will not remain in low wage, low prospect occupations.  People want careers, not jobs.<\/p><p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation recognises this and has stated in an internal document that some of the labour supply issues in certain industries would be alleviated, if not resolved, by the passing of the banded hours legislation.  I am always perplexed to see certain employers describing difficulties in recruitment in certain sectors and almost in the same breath stating that work permits in these sectors should have pay rates pitched at no more than the minimum wage.<\/p><p> Work permits and apprenticeships are linked to the proposition of whether an employer buys in skills or develops them in-house.  We have to be cautious with work permits and bringing in people from outside the EU 28 or EU 27 countries.  The Department takes the view that one of its duties in the area of work permits is to protect the labour market, but what we are really talking about is the labour market of the EU 27.<\/p><p> The apprenticeship system has been recast and remodelled.  A tranche of new apprenticeships has materialised.  The numbers involved are small but the percentages are growing.  Like any experiment, some aspects of the new apprenticeship may falter but that is an argument for more evaluation and support rather than for knocking the new system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542124800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the ICTU deputation for a short, sweet and to-the-point presentation.

I seek the opinion of ICTU on the pilot scheme for work permits, which is primarily targeted at the meat industry.  A total of 800 work permits had been issued for the industry this year as at 5 October.  These were mainly for boners who are paid &euro;22,000 per year or &euro;10.35 per hour.  I have some concerns in this regard.  Currently, employers are advertising on national websites for the same jobs but are including criteria related to accommodation and language skills.  There is no clear indication in respect of these positions about who pays for the language skills courses and the accommodation.  Is someone coming here from Brazil simply given a link to <i>daft.ie<\/i>?  The problem is with enforcement.  The visa is tied to the employer.

It is also physically onerous and workers probably have a short period in that work.

Those responsible arrested the ship and got money from the ship owner.  Ingrid Miley did a lovely Christmassy piece for \"Six One\" of all these Romanians smiling and waving &euro;50 notes.  The interesting thing was that the Ukrainians on the ship stayed on board because they were outside the EU.  If people have rights and know they have them, they will feel free to exercise them.

We are concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about a figure of &euro;22,000.  Normally, if the State sets a wage, it does so in a way that involves an emanation of the State.  In other words, it does so by way of the Low Pay Commission, the Labour Court or the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.  There is a process in place, under which a person or group in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation decided that a given figure would be the wage.  We believe that in the setting of rates for work permits there should be a role for the industrial relations machinery of the State, whether the Labour Court or the Low Pay Commission.  That would allow people to come in and make their pitch.  I made a freedom of information request and discovered that &euro;22,000 is in fact higher than the minimum wage.  According to material we received under the freedom of information process, Meat Industry Ireland wanted the figure capped at the minimum wage.  It seems the Department disagreed and made the figure higher at &euro;22,000.  To that extent, we welcome it, even if we do grudgingly.  The requirement for accommodation and language training is an addition or add-on.  It is to be policed by the Department and the Workplace Relations Commission, as I understand it.  I have had no information about how that policing has worked to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speech","time":1542124800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I followed up that issue.

For example, reference is made to deleting &quot;a&quot; and inserting &quot;the&quot; in paragraph 43 and so on.  The main thing we advocate for is clarity in the setting of wages.  There is a role for the industrial relations machinery of the State in the setting of wages.<br\/><br\/>The question of language is important too.  It is true that we are a migrating country.

We tend not to understand what it is like for people to come to Ireland who speak only Russian or Brazilian and do not really have a clue.  An emphasis on language learning paid for by the employer is important.  Some enlightened employers in the food sector have staff of long-standing who are eastern European or from EEA member countries.  These employers are now paying for language learning.  There are people who have been working for ten years and who are good at the job in question.  The employers would love to promote them to supervisory positions but they simply do not have enough English to be able to do it properly.  Those employers are now providing these types of skills.

We are involved and have two members on the national Apprenticeship Council which operates within SOLAS.  <\/p> <p>  On having a CAO type system, the strength of the apprenticeship system is that there can be no under-filling because it requires an employer to say, \"I want a person.\"  In theory, if the national need for stonemasons is 20 per year, there must be 20 stonemason contractors who will each say they want somebody.  Therefore, we would not favour such a system.  There has to be an interface meeting between the employer and the young person at which the employer can interview the young person and estimate that he or she is suitable.  To combat apprenticeships being held by families, there are and have been bursaries for women apprentices, for example, for quite some time in F&Aacute;S.  However, everyone agrees they have not been greatly successful.  I would say the answer is \"No\" to CAO involvement because it would anonymise the process.  I want to be careful in the light of the Chairman's comments, but if we consider the position on quotas, the president of the Irish Universities Association has said some universities game the system by slicing and dicing their courses into small segments to inflate the courses.  The CAO system is basically an auction.<\/p> <p>  The strength of the apprenticeship model is that there is a contract between the employer and the young person.  I rarely quote an employer, but one of the IBEC representatives on the apprenticeship committee said that for this system to work, it must be sold to the mammies of Ireland in the context of young people in fifth year asking in October, November or December what they are going to do in terms of pursuing a career.  In my first year in college I recall that the first thing I was told was that I was not in school any more, that the lecturers did not care if we did not turn up to lectures or if we did not do our essays because we simply would not pass our examinations, that we were adults and responsible for our own learning.  I was okay with that, but others were not and fell through the system.  However, if somebody turns up for work on a Monday and is told that he or she is in the job, that these are the tasks they have to do, that he or she will be paid on Friday and  that three or six months into his or her apprenticeship he or she will go to an educational and training board training centre or an institute of technology, he or she, first and foremost, will  regard himself or herself as being an employee of the company, subject to the normal requirements of company life and if a reasonable request is made of them to perform some task, he or she will do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speech","time":1542124800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I note that Deputy Kelleher is indicating.

The traditional level 6 apprenticeships are delivered in a mix by the ETBs in the old F&Aacute;S training centres.

The other modules were delivered in the institutes of technology.  There should be no reason it cannot continue.  If one considers the reply to a parliamentary question, tabled, I believe, by Deputy Kelleher, on the range of new apprenticeships, one will note that the institutes of technology have a strong role in many cases.  In some of them where traditionally there would have been 80 apprentices in a class in September, that number would have dropped to 30 or 40 by the following June.  Classes will be swapped to have, say, a consistent level of 60 apprentices right the way through in block releases.

There is a suggestion this is being used to depress wages.  The meat industry has been mentioned.  At what level of wage does Dr. Rigney believe it becomes attractive?  There is a problem with the numbers in that area.  Certainly, there is a need for this policy.  It is a useful and essential policy instrument in a rapidly changing world in terms of the skill sets required.  If we consider companies that want to expand in the IT, pharma and other sectors, opportunities come quickly and we do not have the necessary skills.  Dr. Rigney asked if we should make them or rent them, in other words, do we hire or create our own?  We must do both.  It takes a long time to create our own through a training course.  If we gear up, it will take a few years, but if the need is immediate, we must do both.

Dr. Rigney mentioned the lack of supervision and that people are suddenly on their own when they go to college.  While it is perhaps no longer as common as it once was, many people who went to boarding school where they were under total supervision used to run into trouble when they suddenly found themselves with a great deal of freedom.  There is another more serious situation, which is that even though we have free education the cost of accommodation and supporting oneself is a real challenge.  If one is from a larger family it can be prohibitive.  People earning as they learn is certainly something I strongly support.  I agree with the comment made by the employer about selling apprenticeships to the mothers of Ireland because a bit of intellectual snobbery goes on.  I mentioned that while in Germany we visited the Sparkasse bank, which has its own set-up for educating bankers.  It is a programme on which people earn as they learn.  They make a wage but they also learn about banking.  It is good because it instils a particular ethos about community and looking at the business and person and not just at the opportunity to make a commission, which is what got us into so much trouble in the past with regard to banking.

The bitter complaints I have heard at union meetings are from Polish and Lithuanian citizens who complain about the pressure of non-EEA workers.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to another point.  With regard to the foreign born population, for want of a better phrase, Ireland has one of the highest percentages in the EU.  We have been extremely open to migrants in our labour market since 2004.  We were one of the three countries that opened up fully to the EU 10, as they were known.

This is evident in the construction industry, particularly when there is a downturn in the economy.  Many people, particularly men, are physically beaten up after a tough time on the sites but apart from their trade, they have no other skill sets.  This is primarily true of the wet trades but it is also true of other areas, such as agriculture, that take a heavy toll on the body.  Engineers are one thing because they are mobile and if there is a skills shortage, we may be able to recruit engineers outside the country.

There is very much a \"them and us\" situation.  People either opt for an apprenticeship course in the traditional sense which takes them down one route or they go to third level.  The two routes never meet.  In Germany and elsewhere, there is a symbiotic crossover of apprenticeships and academic third level facilities.  Could we be more creative and imaginative in this area?  An apprenticeship course might take people to a level 6 qualification and they could then move to a level 8 qualification and degree courses, before continuing even further.<\/p> <p>  While the State has been involved in overseeing apprenticeships, traditionally through F&Aacute;S and now through SOLAS, is there a greater role for the public sector, multinational companies of all shapes and colours and the financial services sector in providing apprenticeships?

Are we creative and imaginative enough in this regard?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of work permits, traditionally a free marketeer or capitalist believes that if there is a shortage of labour, the price of labour will increase and people will flow into that particular sector.  Of course, it does not happen like that, particularly in lower skilled areas such as agriculture, parts of construction, horticulture and the hospitality sector.  Does the cost of accommodation in this country create the potential for exploitation in view of the fact that, let us be honest, people could be working 40 hours a week for &euro;10 an hour but if the employer's accommodation charges are excessive, it could have a major impact on that person?  Is there any evidence this is beginning to happen?  In a previous life, I was the Minister of State when we established the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which was vilified to be honest.  During the previous boom, NERA began to unearth cases in the farming and fishing sectors which indicated that accommodation was being used almost as a prison because people could not afford to go anywhere else.

It is the electrical apprenticeship at Limerick Institute of Technology, which one can only get into if one is an electrician.  The best way to build level 7 engineers is to take level 6 electricians and train them, mainly at the weekend.  Purely anecdotally, many multinationals come in with the necessary money and hire hundreds of engineers.  They then allocate them tasks which one does not need an engineer to do.  Young engineers say they find it difficult to get continuing professional development, CPD, points.  They are handling compliance, quality assurance and ticking boxes and it is not real engineering.  Companies would probably be better off handling compliance and quality assurance with somebody who has been in the industry for a time, is cute and knows the scams people try to get around quality assurance box-ticking, which we all do, to be honest.  There is a global shortage of engineers.  Multinationals come in and have the money to hire them by the gross.  There must be other ways to build them and some way to ask multinationals if they really need engineers for all these tasks.  I know Engineers Ireland has an associate position at technician level which gives a pathway towards being a chartered engineer.<\/p> <p>  With regard to work permits, an interesting thing in the most recent interdepartmental group was that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was involved.  It was not in the previous boom.  The Department's attitude was to ask why companies were bringing in people to do work for which there are able people already here in houses.  An issue this time with bringing people in from outside the country to do anything is how much more difficult it will be for existing workers to get or to pay for accommodation or to be condemned to four hours of commuting every day.  All these things are linked.  Traditionally, if we go back to the 19th century, employers built houses.  Guinness built houses for its employees, as did many mills and railway companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speech","time":1542124800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Good employers built houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#G00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542124800,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Yes.

In Dublin, even a month will not get a person sorted out with anything affordable.<\/p> <p>  I wish to draw the committee's attention to the role of people who come in on visas to learn the English language.

There is a Bill in the Seanad for new legislation in this area.  From what we have seen, it could represent a regressive step.  As opposed to mandatory insurance before one moves, there will be a sinking fund such as in the case of the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland.  There is a danger here that we are going back to the old issue of light-touch regulation.

They have almost disappeared as a body.  One thing that apprenticeships allow, although it has not been fully developed, is the provision for the development of lifelong learning.  I do not want to give employers a bad reputation because many want to do the right thing for their workforce.  Employers often say that the people in their 20s are of limited use to them.  Maybe they should ask if there is something they can do for people in their 40s with a block release and upskilling course because they know the industry.  In a previous role in the organisation, when we were running a health and safety training course, I was collecting the fees in September.  I went to the Red Cow Luas construction site and took a wad of money from a dumper driver who said it was a young man's game and he wanted to get into health and safety.  That says it all to me.  If we want to build careers in construction as opposed to jobs, that is the way forward.

I was employed by a progressive employer who was interested in life-long learning and worked with the trade union movement to develop training courses for people as they move through their career and their careers change.  At the height of the last boom, quite a number of construction workers moved into the pharmaceutical industry, basically with a leaving certificate qualification.  When the collapse came, one had to have a degree rather than a leaving certificate before one could get an interview.  The required qualification increased.  The State has a role to acknowledge the idea of lifelong learning and career changes.  People cannot stay in the meat industry or building trades all their lives.  The State has a responsibility to provide an education and outlet to allow people to change their careers at different stages.  We need construction workers but a blocklayer cannot work laying blocks in his late 50s.  He will not be physically capable of it.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the expansion of the apprenticeship schemes.  My opinion is always to plan for the worst and hope for the best.  In the last collapse, people had invested three or four years into an apprenticeship and were not able to finish it.  When we are encouraging people to enter apprenticeships, there has to be a commitment that they will be able to finish that apprenticeship and will not be caught three or four years into a cycle when a collapse happens.<\/p><p>If a person goes to university to do a degree, they are safe enough and know the university will be there for the four year or five year degree.  The same confidence has to be given to people who want to participate in apprenticeships that they will be able to start and finish, even if there is a collapse in the economy during the period.  Nobody was chucked out of university but an awful lot of apprentice electricians were chucked out of their jobs and were not able to finish.  We need to do a level of work on that.<\/p><p> Senator Reilly mentioned the whispers in regard to work permits.  I work extensively in the inner city.  One of the whispers on the go is in regard to work permits in the hospitality sector and related abuses, which I hear about on a regular basis.  The other is in regard to the meat industry.  It is good in one way when we say 22,000, which sounds like a lot, but it is not for a highly skilled job.  In themselves, work permits are welcome but I am anxious in this regard.  The witnesses mentioned the statistic that over 15% of our workforce were not born in Ireland yet we do not have the same issues that other countries have, which is welcome.  However, we must have a well managed work permit system to make sure we do not go down the avenues other countries have gone down in the past.<\/p><p> There are small issues, for example, the exploitation happening in regard to stamp 4 permissions.  I was just talking to a young woman who has a stamp 4 permission which she has to renew.  However, because of the flaws in the system, all the appointments are booked and she has to pay a private company to get an appointment.  We need to move very quickly in regard to closing down such abuses.  This is somebody who wants to work and who we have encouraged to come here to fill a skills gap, but this is now being abused and she is required to go to the private sector.  I will be approaching this with a view to ensuring it does not become a drag on wages and that people who come to this country to work and who require a visa are treated to a very high standard.  We have not always been that good in such areas.  The witnesses mentioned the work this committee has done in regard to the fisheries sector.

It is over six years since IBEC was invited to participate on the then Government&rsquo;s review of apprenticeship training in Ireland.  At the time, it was felt that the apprenticeship system, which was limited to 26 craft-based occupations, did not reflect the broad skills needs of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>The review suggested a new model of business-led apprenticeships that could boost skill levels across the economy and help to get people into sustainable jobs.<\/p><p> Companies would be involved in both the design of curricula and in the delivery of the on-the-job element of programmes, some of which could extend up to higher degree level.  This would ensure the continuing relevance of qualifications in a rapidly changing labour market.  The new apprenticeships could offer a real alternative to ambitious and capable young people, who may be looking for alternatives to direct entry from school to higher education, and would be interested in an earn-and-learn model.<\/p><p> A lot of hard work has been put into a project to turn this aspiration into a reality.  Some of us have been frustrated at the speed at which the new apprenticeships have come on stream but, in retrospect, this probably should not be a surprise.<\/p><p> The starting point for any consideration of new apprenticeship models usually includes a reference to the well-established dual systems of countries such as Austria, Switzerland and Germany.  Much of the commentary tends to ignore the fact that Ireland cannot simply adopt systems that have been built over generations upon very different economies, labour markets and social partnership arrangements.  We also have to acknowledge the reality that apprenticeships, and vocational education in general, tend not to enjoy parity of esteem in a society that tends to define educational achievement in terms of CAO points and entry to higher education.<\/p><p> This is not to say that we do not have much to learn from other national systems.  In fact, the apprenticeship review group report tried to distil some of the principles on which they are based to inform a model that could work in an Irish context.  We should remember apprenticeships are a distinct model of education.  They are not internships or traineeships.  They are a deep and academically accredited learning experience in preparation for a specific occupation.<\/p><p> I believe that the new apprenticeship project, as we call it, is beginning to gain some momentum.<\/p><p> The Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeships and Traineeships 2016-2020 sets ambitious, but achievable, targets for the introduction of 40 new programmes and a cumulative total of 33,000 new apprenticeship registrations by 2020.  Almost 20 new programmes, in areas such as accountancy, ICT, insurance, international financial services, manufacturing and biopharmaceuticals, have come on stream.  The committee will have an opportunity to hear in more detail about some of these apprenticeships from my colleagues.<\/p><p> I will turn briefly to the subject of work permits.  When we discuss work permits, it is important to differentiate between labour and skills shortages.  Labour shortage refers to a situation in which there is a shortage of individuals willing or available to take up employment opportunities.  Skills shortage refers to a situation in which there is a shortage or an insufficient number of trained or qualified individuals in the domestic market to meet the demand.<\/p><p> In the main, the Irish employment permits system has in the past responded relatively well to labour market shortages and surpluses.  The mix of permit types, criteria and duration has served us well over the past number of years drawing on market intelligence from the expert group for future skills needs, the SOLAS skills and labour market research unit, the National Skills Council and general employer engagement.  This is supported by EU-level analysis which shows that Ireland leads most EU member states in terms of developing labour migration policy that is linked with labour market intelligence, connecting almost all employment permits to identified labour market gaps.<\/p><p> However, as we move towards full employment, the ability to enable future growth potential depends on how well we address labour shortages and respond to shifts brought about by the changing economic conditions facing different sectors.  We welcome some of the recommendations made by the interdepartmental Review of Economic Migration Policy such as new measures to attract foreign nationals who have relevant experience in areas such as ICT but who may not have the required academic qualification.<\/p><p> The number of employment permits has been increasing in recent years with more than 9,000 new permits issued in 2017.  The IT and health and welfare sectors combined accounted for three quarters of all new permits issued.  Nine of the top 20 companies for which employment permits were issued were technology companies.  The other 11 were healthcare organisations.  New permits were primarily issued for professional occupations with two thirds of all new permits issued for the Dublin region.<\/p><p> As I stated earlier, the current system performs well in general.  The highly skilled occupational list is reviewed on a timely basis and engages well with the labour market intelligence available.  At an operational level, however, there have been challenges, particularly in recent months, around transitioning from the critical skills work permit after two years to the Stamp 4 permission to work.  While the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation provides a letter for the individual after 21 months of employment, there can be problems receiving the immigration stamp in a timely fashion.  Greater collaboration between the Department and the naturalisation and immigration services is needed to ensure that after investing in these highly skilled employees, we do not lose this talent due to unnecessarily bureaucratic procedures or disconnection between Government services.<\/p><p> Work needs to be done to ensure a cohesive interdepartmental approach to work permits and visas as delays in this area are becoming a significant issue, not only for day-to-day applications but also within the trusted partner initiative.  My colleague, Ms Una Fitzpatrick, from Technology Ireland will be able to provide practical examples of the issues encountered by her member companies in this regard.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for this opportunity to introduce this subject.

We had all the stakeholders in from across all the different sectors.  It was interesting to hear from the tourism and hospitality sector, agriculture and construction, all of which bemoaned the lack of apprenticeships coming through.  The tourism and hospitality sectors spoke about the dismantling of CERT in 2013, stating that there has not been any single organisation with sole responsibility for hospitality and tourism since then and that the lack of this training policy has left a significant void in that sector.<\/p> <p>  We heard a great deal about those who would have worked in the construction sector who when they get to their mid-50s find it difficult to continue along on those lines because it is a physical job.

I will take hospitality first.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to coming back to the committee at the end of the month with another hat on.  I chair the expert group on future skills needs, and we have been looking at hospitality.  We have heard much of what the committee has heard in terms of the shortages in that sector.<\/p><p>It is not the first time we have heard the closure of CERT being bemoaned by the sector.  I think it lacked a lead Department to take ownership of it.  The expert group has done analysis of the hospitality sector and there are new implementation structures in place.  I hope they will be able to address that issue.  On female apprentices, that reflects the structure of the industries in which apprenticeships have traditionally existed.  Some 80% of apprenticeships were in the construction sector and, because of the nature of those trades, they tended to be male dominated.  In fact, there has been a change since the introduction of new apprenticeships.  For example, in the insurance apprenticeship we have 100 females so we have probably more female apprentices on that one programme than in the entire history of apprenticeship in the State.  As we see the expansion of the model into other sectors, we will see that gender balance issue addressed.

I represent the medtech and engineering sectors within IBEC.  That includes medical technologies, polymer technologies and engineered manufacturing goods.  This cohort represents about 80,000 people in Ireland.  What is unique about those companies is that there is a significantly large proportion of SMEs.  In 2017, after working for three years, we finally launched three apprenticeship programmes - manufacturing technician at level 6, manufacturing engineer at level 7 and polymer technology at level 7.  We are delighted to say that we recruited 106 apprentices in year one across 58 companies, of whom 2% were women.  This year we have gone to 170 apprentices with 10% female in the second cohort.  We are working very closely on this and are trying to promote more women in our apprenticeship programmes.  It is a priority for our boards to encourage more women into the apprenticeship programmes.  We acknowledge the point and it is something we are working towards.<\/p> <p>  Our apprenticeships are run in conjunction with five institutes of technology partners in Limerick, Cork, Athlone, Sligo and Galway.  That is a reflection of the industries we are serving, which are highly regionalised.  In terms of recruitment, currently 70% of the 170 are within the industry.  They are recruited within the sector so are already working within the companies, while 30% are new hires.  We expect that to change over the years ahead.  We expect more new hires as the industry becomes upskilled.  We have been among the first out of the blocks in terms of new apprenticeships.  It is important to remember that it is an occupational profile.  The apprenticeship we are operating is open to all manufacturing sectors.  Of the types of company that have engaged, 48% are in medical technologies and 52% are in engineering.  It is quite broad and the occupational profile is a building block for engineering in general.  We are out there promoting it far and wide.  This year, we have recruited in food, ICT, aviation, automotive - we are recruiting in lots of different manufacturing sectors.<\/p> <p>  One of the challenges of expanding the apprenticeships is the cost of getting involved.  For an SME or company to engage in the apprenticeship, the cost of a three year programme for a new hire is about &euro;90,000.  Our apprenticeship includes 15 weeks off-site and we spent two years developing that model.  As it is a hands-on, technical training type of apprenticeship, the requirement to be off-site and within the institute of technology is very important to gain those skills.  It is quite different from other apprenticeships because there is that focus on practical skills.  This creates a major challenge for a lot of SMEs in terms of cost and this is one of the major barriers to us in terms of growing the apprenticeships.  It is an issue we would like to bring to the committee's attention.  We have a couple of other issues but that would probably be the main one at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1542124800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>By and large, apprenticeships have historically been in the construction sector and, through CERT, in the hospitality sector.

Clearly there is a lot to be done but it is a step.  I am not making a criticism.  These are just observations.  We are all trying to work our way around to seeing how we can best advance apprenticeships.  What incentives are required?  I have always believed the public sector should play a greater role in providing apprenticeships.  The financial and banking sectors as well as multinationals would also have the capacity and the incentive to deliver apprenticeship courses for upskilling their employees.  I do not hold with the idea that we can allow somebody else to train the people, that we can employ them, let them go when there is a downturn and, if there is a skill shortage, bring them in from abroad.  Certainly that is not a long-term sustainable way of managing a labour market or an economy that is constantly evolving.<\/p> <p>  The Chair referred to another aspect of this.  Some apprenticeships in trades can evolve and move into other areas.  However, in certain areas and particularly in the construction industry and hospitality - areas that traditionally have offered lower pay - it is hard to move beyond the traditional apprenticeship role.  A block layer is a block layer until the arthritis sets in and he can no longer lay blocks.  It is often the same for people in the hospitality sector below lower management level, in the basic skill set areas.  They do not move that well through the system.  What can we do to make clear pathways into apprenticeship and clear pathways for career progression?  Is it possible to use the apprenticeship as the anchor but to branch off from it into formal education, training, third level degrees or something else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#K00500","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542124800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I will respond to the first question about what we can do in terms of incentivising.

That has been a pinch point, particularly for SMEs.  Deputy Kelleher made two other points I would like to pick up on.  He used the example of a block-layer.  I think there has been acknowledgement within the traditional craft apprenticeships that they did not focus enough on what we call the transversal skills, that is, the employability skills, the softer skills.  Therefore, there were very few opportunities to move out of such apprenticeships.  It should be a broader education experience.  I was taken by Deputy Kelleher's use of the word \"anchor\" and his point that the apprenticeship is the anchor.  I agree 100%, and what characterises the new apprenticeships are the progression opportunities.  I will bring in my two colleagues here because we have examples of being able to provide a pathway into apprenticeships and then, particularly in the high-tech sector, progression opportunities through to higher degree level.  Not everyone might want to go that far, but that progression opportunity should at least be available.  The reason this is so critical is that if one is competing, as I said in my opening remarks, with the CAO system, those progression opportunities need to be available within the apprenticeship model.  That is the power of the model.  As I said, with the Chairman's permission, I will introduce an example first of progression into apprenticeship and then of progression to the higher levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542124800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Kelleher first.  I thank him for his question.  I will very briefly touch on pre-apprenticeship programmes because the time for them is now while we have a very tight labour market and are looking at how we can provide more and more people with the opportunity to participate in an education programme.  Pre-apprenticeship programmes are generally targeted at young people between the ages of 16 and 24.  The aim is for them to progress fully to an apprenticeship.  Pre-apprenticeships are aimed at giving young people the necessary skills, confidence and connections.  The latter is incredibly important because in the craft or more traditional apprenticeships people might not have had that social network or the capital to ask an uncle or a neighbour to participate and be trained by them as a master apprentice.  Pre-apprenticeships aim to give them that opportunity and that network to do so.  They provide a combination of vocational training, hands-on experience and an opportunity to sample some skills across a broad spectrum of training programmes.  Generally, they are targeted at young people who may not have been very successful until that point in making a positive or sustained transition into more vocational training.  This is a tailored programme to offer them that.  I was very heartened to see some of the recommendations in the recently published SOLAS review of Pathway to Apprenticeships.  This aims to increase pre-apprenticeship programmes around the country by about 500 by the third quarter of 2019.  However, this ambition will not be realised without adequate resources to enable such transition and changeover.<\/p> <p>  I will introduce the committee to a pilot programme under way with DIT.  It is one of the first such programmes in Ireland and has not really received significant State funding to date.  It has been supported by the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, a philanthropic fund, and philanthropic funding through the ESB.  In 2017 DIT launched a pilot programme aimed at supporting the transition of young people, particularly from areas of socio-economic disadvantage in Dublin's inner city centre, to secure apprenticeships.  DIT has its roots in vocational education.  Traditionally, it supplied about 25% of the traditional apprenticeships.  This pilot programme was about addressing young people's lack of knowledge in these areas to secure apprenticeships as well as those low levels of social capital that I mentioned and generally targeting areas within inner city Dublin.  It was rolled out over 18 months, during which period 48 students were recruited on three separate 12 week programmes.  The 12 week programmes focused on offering various different skills and opportunities to learn about different types of apprenticeships and ultimately to build links with employers in order that they could see the output of these programmes.  This is known as worked access to an apprenticeship.  It worked in partnership with employers to provide a two week work placement at the end of the 12 week programme.  Over 50% of the apprenticeships managed to fulfil that workplace programme.  The two week placement took place at the end and gave these young people a really good insight into a workplace environment and experience of what the reality of an apprenticeship would be like.  It gave them an opportunity to determine whether this would be a pathway for them.  DIT reached into its network of apprenticeship employers and developed a multifaceted work experience approach whereby apprentices had an opportunity to work with Sisk, with one of the aviation technology companies or with the ESB.  The programme was also supported by an advisory board and had input from key representative groups, including IBEC; the HEA; the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA; the Dublin Regional Skills Forum; the Construction Industry Federation, CIF; and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  Everyone gave their different perspectives from their experiences of young people, education provision and employment.  After the initial pilot programme, out of the 48 young people, 26 moved into full-time apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  This pilot scheme has, therefore, demonstrated in an 18 month period the power of a pre-apprenticeship programme and the transformational effect it can have.  DIT is now working on a second-stage pilot programme, again funded by JPMorgan, and this time has managed to secure some State funding via the HEA.  It is hoped this will aim to develop the programme and work on a couple of tweaks to refine it built on how it evolved over phase one.  It will run from October 2018 to March 2021.  How can we support this to bed into our system?  Given the fact this programme was seen as a level 6 special purpose award, it was not fully recognised by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as a qualifying programme for trainee allowances.  This could potentially be a red-line issue in the future because the participants were not able to maintain social welfare payments.  As a result, they forwent them for the 12 week programme and risked losing their payments upon taking up a course.  This will be a fundamental stumbling block to rolling this out and achieving the number of 500 by the third quarter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire McGee"},{"type":"speech","time":1542124800,"counter":522,"content":"<p>May I interject?

This is not recognised as a training programme because it is not on the national qualifications framework and is a special purpose award.  If we could perhaps do a little work on getting that recognition for it, it would fulfil the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's requirements in respect of being able to manage a back to work allowance or retain or receive a social welfare payment.  This is critical if we think about the cohort who will be involved.  This is also very much focused on a pilot scheme within Dublin city centre, within DIT, and again, what we now need to see for it to be successful is a mainstreaming across the system.  A programme such as this could easily work in Limerick, Cork or Galway, where there are equal socio-economic issues that need to be addressed and particular challenges or certain regional employers who need specific skills.  How can we look at rolling this out on a more national basis and get more education and training providers to get involved?<\/p> <p>  Picking up on the point about female participation, there were two ladies who participated in this programme.  They happen to be sisters.  One has not managed to progress to a full-time apprenticeship.  One was 20 and the other was 16, so the latter was just slightly too young to take on the full programme.  Nonetheless, they are being used front and centre of the programme's campaign to showcase that this is a very good avenue for females to consider if they want to consider apprenticeships in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire McGee"},{"type":"speech","time":1542124800,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Would Ms McGee mind sharing with us what types of apprenticeships they went on to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018111300002#L00800","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542124800,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I can do so after this meeting, if that is okay.

First of all, it was a step change, in that it was a different way of approaching this.  I think the model is still right, the model of enterprise-led apprenticeships is the right one, but the number of actors involved includes SOLAS, the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Education and Skills and Qualifications and Quality Ireland.  There are four arms of the State, although that is not to criticise the State.  There are also multiple companies.  It has been relatively straightforward with the IBEC ones because they have been single sector or groups.  There is only one prime group for the medtech and engineering sector, or Technology Ireland, or pharmachem.  In other sectors, there are multiple groups that are trying to come together.  There are a lot of actors there and by definition, that slowed it down.<\/p> <p>  The apprenticeship plan is a 12-stage process.  We are using 40 year old legislation here.  Much of the legislation is still fit for purpose in respect of protection of apprenticeship and employing somebody on a contract of apprenticeship.  We would not change a word of that, we think it is fine in terms of the rights and responsibilities of both employers and apprentices.  In terms of approval of companies and designations of sectors, the legislation is probably out of date and we need to streamline that process.  The apprenticeship plan is presented as a circle of 12 steps, but it is actually more like \"Snakes and Ladders\" in the sense that if one gets to a point, one can go back.  If one does not get approval, for example, under Qualifications and Quality Ireland, one has to go back to the drawing board.  <\/p> <p>  I have no issue about the involvement of the quality assurance agencies because if this is to mean anything, it needs to be something of which employers and learners are confident in the quality but the processes are probably still a bit bureaucratic.  I think it is getting better, however.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to introduce Ms Siobh&aacute;n Dean because she launched some apprenticeships that were announced by the Minister last week.  She has got through the process a bit quicker than some of the others who were early adopters, so we are probably getting better at that.

We launched our programme just last week comprising the higher certificate in science, that is, a level six lab technician, and the ordinary bachelor of science degree, that is, a level seven analytical scientist.  It is unique to our sector.  Of the scientists in our sector, 100% of the staff have a third level qualification, so it is unique to our industry.<\/p> <p>  It is a key point that it was industry led.  The need came from the report of the expert group on future skills needs of 2016.

We were very successful in turning that around within nine months, once we got approval, but it is a balancing act of trying to get up through the snakes and ladders, as Mr. Donohoe mentioned.  Quality is of the utmost importance, as is the ability to progress on to levels eight and nine within the sector.<\/p> <p>  The other key thing which made this very successful is that it is not developed only for the biopharma industry.

Until six months ago, the system was still somewhat bureaucratic but working well.  Technology companies which are trusted partners, be that an Enterprise Ireland or an IDA Ireland member client, were assured they would have an answer to a work permit application within two weeks.  At that point, they can go on to obtain a visa.  That process takes nine weeks, therefore, the best case scenario is ten to 11 weeks.  That was not great but we could live with it.  Business likes certainty and if there is certainty around those sort of dates, it can work to those.<\/p> <p>  In recent months, however, the feedback from companies has been that even the processing time for trusted partners has slipped to eight to 12 weeks.  There was an update on the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation website regarding processing times, apologising for the delays, advising that it had received a high number of applications and that the current waiting times were five weeks for trusted partners and 14 weeks for standard applications.  The feedback from our member companies is that the waiting times are significantly higher.  In terms of the consequences of those delays, job offers are falling through and significant costs are being incurred by both multinational companies and indigenous software technology companies.  Companies are using many third parties companies to process applications, thereby increasing costs.<\/p> <p>  The feedback on this to their corporate headquarters is particularly negative in that they are asking the reason that is not happening at the moment.  We have been in touch with the Department through the Tech\/Life Ireland review, which is a process that looks at attracting people into Ireland, specifically for the technology sector.  The feedback was that something happened within the Department - we never got to the bottom of what it was - but that it was working to resolve it.<\/p> <p>  The fact that this has occurred in the past six months has led to a number of concerns on the part of companies.  They first wanted it amended but asked if this will happen again.  Ultimately, that begins a debate on the question, why Ireland?  It has led to many questions being pushed back.  A company in Cork could not hire one key figure, which led to 200 jobs being moved to Prague.  Those are the impactful case studies.  I make the point that it might seem like one hire or one application but it has massive ramifications in terms of industry because that person could be leading an entire team, and that team will go with that person.<\/p> <p>  Our request is that there would be an immediate fix to the current problem.

As we will still be members of the common travel area with the UK, our citizens will have access to the UK labour market and, equally, the UK labour market will have access to Irish citizens in the Republic.  Irish citizens will have access to the European Union labour market and the European Union will have access to the Republic of Ireland labour market.  In all of that, the country most likely to be affected in terms of a draw of labour is the Republic of Ireland in the sense that if there was very strong growth in the UK, many Irish people potentially could move to the UK because European labour would no longer have access to the UK whereas the Republic of Ireland would within the common travel area.  The opposite is the case also because if the European Union weakens and the Republic of Ireland has a strong economy, there could be a movement of people either from the UK or Europe or both because we will be in the unique position of having access to both labour markets.  With that in mind, has the issue of the continued convergence of mutual recognition between the UK and Ireland post Brexit, regardless of whether there is a soft, medium or hard Brexit, been examined?  It would be important that in terms of apprenticeships and courses of all forms, there would be continual mutual recognition with the UK.  That would have profound implications in the context of Northern Ireland and the Border counties.<\/p><p>Has anyone looked at that?  I acknowledge the difficulty of looking into something opaque but by the time it becomes crystal clear, it could be too late for us if we do not have the detail and certainty around mutual recognition.

We have ten levels whereas the UK has eight.  However, there has been a great deal of work on alignment, a lot of which was done, ironically enough, during the last boom.  A lot of labour was coming in at the time and the then-qualifications agency did significant work on that.  Its website eventually became that of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  A lot of work has been done to read across different types of framework.  However, the Deputy's general point is interesting.  One of the first responses to Brexit came from higher education.  Many of the universities started to get inquiries from British-based academics and it was not just Irish people working in UK institutions.  Something like Brexit goes against the core of academics and there is nothing more international than higher education.  As such, there were many unprompted inquiries to education institutions here.

These meetings are the second part of a process which began in June with a public invitation to make written submissions to the committee.  On behalf of the committee, I sincerely thank all those who sent in submissions on this topic.  The committee hopes that, through this public consultation initiative, we can create an integrated national strategy proposal document supporting the fostering, growth and sustainability of indigenous SMEs in becoming a key foundation block for the long-term success of the economy.  We hope to identify and evaluate the key challenges for SMEs, review the existing business environment in Ireland and research relevant successful SME national policies in other countries.  These are some of the issues the committee hopes to tease out through this public consultation exercise.  Following these hearings, a draft report will be prepared for the committee by our rapporteur, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  The committee will review the draft report and publish its final report as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Today's meeting will comprise three sessions.  Session one, which will begin now, will concern the SME owner's perspective; session two, at 4.15 p.m., will address the national perspective; and session three, at 6 p.m., will be on the regional perspective.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the witnesses to the first session: Mr. David Walsh, group chief executive officer, CEO, of Netwatch; Ms Evelyn O'Toole, CEO of Complete Laboratory Solutions; Deputy Michael D'Arcy, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for financial services and insurance, accompanied by Mr. Ian Kavanagh from the Department of Finance; and Mr. Dominic Doheny, president, and Mr. Tom Parlon, director general of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.  They are most welcome and we thank them for engaging with the committee in the consideration of this important topic.  <\/p><p>Before we begin, I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I invite Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to make a few introductory remarks at the beginning.  I will then invite each witness to make a short presentation.  They may share time if they wish.  They should indicate this to me when they are invited to speak.  I ask that presenters keep their opening statements as brief as possible.  When the presentations have finished, there will be time for some questions and comments from Senators and responses from the witnesses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#A00200","speaker":"1420","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it ag an Teach inniu agus labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; i mB&eacute;arla anois.  I thank the Chairman.  The Minister of State is more than welcome.  We had a conversation about this last week where he shared his commitment.  He had other commitments today and he changed things around to facilitate us.  I also thank the Leader of the House, Senator Buttimer, for his strong support.  I also thank my colleagues on this committee for their agreement and support with regard to the very important document and work we are undertaking.  I thank Ms Bridget Doody and Ms Carol Judge from the Seanad Office because without them, we would not have even got to this stage.  As far as I know, this is the first time that the Upper House has been set aside to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in Ireland - where we are, the challenges we face and how we can improve the environment for SMEs in Ireland.  Very often, the term we use in the Irish language is ag sn&aacute;mh in aghaidh easa - swimming against the tide.  As someone who has set up in business, I know what swimming against the tide is like because that is what one is doing most of the time.  What one really wants are calm waters.  One is not looking for a big push but calm water.  The purpose of this meeting, as the Chairman has noted, is to focus on the SME sector in Ireland.  Over 1 million people are employed by SMEs.  These women and men do not work 40 or even 80 hours per week.  They work north of 100 hours per week to develop their passion.  They would be much better off if they did not take these risks with themselves, their homes and their families.  A manager of a bank in the UK once told me that almost every business person he had met had lost one or more of three things.  They lost their home, their family or their wealth.  Quite frankly, many of us, including me, have been very close to the edge more than once.<\/p> <p>  What we can do is help create the environment to facilitate people to take that leap, get more involved in enterprise and contribute to their community and society.  The contribution they give to society is very much a passion for entrepreneurs and SMEs such as supporting local charities or GAA, rugby or soccer clubs.  That is the integration with the community because they see they are part of a much bigger picture.  The bigger picture with regard to the Upper and Lower Houses of the Oireachtas is that we need to create the environment to facilitate that greater contribution.  This is an opportunity for us to do that and to create what I hope will be the basis of a White Paper we will share with Government and all politicians to help foster and develop that into a much more structured and focused strategy document.  Right now, various people in organisations are focusing on their own particular area but this is the first time we are bringing the whole lot under one umbrella.  I very much welcome and appreciate this.  I thank my personal assistant, Ms C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh, and Dr. Majella Giblin for their help and support in making this happen.  It would not have happened without them.  I thank all those here today for their commitment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#B00200","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I call on our first witness, Mr. David Walsh, group chief executive officer, CEO, of Netwatch Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#B00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>As the Chairman said, my name is David Walsh.  I am the CEO and founder of a company called Netwatch Ireland that is based in Carlow.  I am delighted and honoured to be here today.  I am very happy to make a positive and meaningful contribution to helping the committee shape the future landscape of the environment in which SMEs in this country operate.  I promise to be open and honest in my comments today.  In that context, I must say that I do not believe the system is broken.  I believe we have a very good system in Ireland but it needs to tweaked to be relevant to today compared with some time in the past.  My observations will be through the lens of an indigenous Irish company that is internationally focused.  Other speakers are better equipped to address the challenges faced by SMEs that exercise their prerogative to remain on the island of Ireland, create jobs and do business in Ireland and in doing so, do a fantastic job in their local communities.<\/p> <p>  Over the next few minutes, I will provide a quick overview of Netwatch Ireland and how with the support of State agencies, particularly the local enterprise office, LEO, and Enterprise Ireland, we grew from being a small startup in Carlow to becoming a large global business.  We are now one of the largest employers in the south east of Ireland.  Following that, I will reflect on my experience over the past 16 years.  I will focus on three key areas that, if tweaked, would lead to more startups in this country and would enable and empower existing SMEs to deliver their full potential.  These three areas relate to the journey we experienced from the very beginning to the middle to what happens at the end when an entrepreneur decides to retire.  I will look at the financial supports for startups, the importance of innovation with regard to SMEs and how it should be supported.  Finally, I will discuss the incentives that should be there to promote and drive entrepreneurship in this country.  <\/p> <p>  Netwatch Ireland is a Carlow company.  We are very proud of that fact and see it as part of our competitive advantage.  We started Netwatch Ireland back in 2003.  As our friends across the pond in the US would say, we have just completed 63 quarters and have grown in every single one of them despite challenges along the way.  We now have 300,000 customers across four continents and employ 600 people across the globe, 200 of whom are in Ireland with the vast majority based in Carlow.  I am proud of what we can give the people of Carlow.  We give them the opportunity to live and work in their local community but our impact is far greater than just direct employment.  Many local enterprises in Carlow are suppliers to Netwatch.  In addition, we invest heavily in the local community.  We invest in local charities, schools and sports, particularly GAA and rugby, because it is very important for us.  Our key objective is to bring life to the wider community in which we do business.  <\/p> <p>  Looking back over our journey, there is no question that there have been challenges at every stage.  Many of those challenges are still there today.  The hardest part of the journey was step 1, in terms of raising seed capital to grow the business.  We were turned down by our very first bank.  The second bank we went to forced us, and I use the word \"forced\" deliberately, to sign personal guarantees or else we would not get the finance.  It took us five years of positive training to force that bank to release those personal guarantees.  If this country is serious about getting more startups into the funnel that creates big businesses, no startup should ever be asked sign personal guarantees.  It is bad enough giving up the comfort of a regular salary and removing the safety net of the social welfare system but there is a window when somebody is starting or thinking about starting a business where the fear of failure can become a stronger emotion than the hope of success.  When somebody is asked to give up his or her salary and the social welfare safety net, being asked to sign a personal guarantee can be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  I have spoken to many people over the years who had fantastic ideas but who, because of the need to sign personal guarantees, did not start their businesses.  <\/p> <p>  The second point concerns innovation and how we grow our businesses.  There is no doubt but that innovation is the key to sustainable success.  It is our competitive advantage and unique value proposition.  We live in a market of rapid change across the globe.  There are only two types of organisation in the world when it comes to change: drivers of change and victims of change.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, companies that are victims of change do not survive; they have a stay of execution.  When the rate of change in the external market is faster than that in our own companies, we will become victims of change.  Research and development is therefore critical if we are to grow our business and compete, particularly internationally.<\/p><p> This brings me to the point I am trying to make.  The research and development tax credit system, which was designed to encourage Irish SMEs to invest in research and development, was great on paper but, in reality, does not work.  It is too onerous and too complicated.  One would need a dedicated accounts department dealing with the research and development applications alone.  Not only that, but then one must check again to ensure that the application is correct, and the only specialists in the country in this regard are probably involved in the top four accountancy firms.  Even after that, Revenue has five years to come back and audit one's accounts to see if one did the right job.  It is too onerous.  It is very important we innovate.  Innovation is at the heart of everything we do in Netwatch.  Using the very best brains of Carlow IT, which is on our doorstep, we set up our own research and development department many years ago.  The results are breathtaking.  We now have a suite of software solutions that allows us to compete with very large organisations across the globe, companies that are ten times the size of Netwatch.  We can beat them not on price but on quality and the services we provide.  Again, we used the research and development tax credit system in the first year or two but then we stopped.  It was too cumbersome and just too much hassle.  This year we will invest more than &euro;1 million in research and development in our organisation and we will take it on the chin.  We will do it ourselves because it is the right thing to do.  There should be supports available for this, though.  We are lucky as an organisation in that we are financially strong and have a financial backer that understands research and development.  However, the vast majority of SMEs cannot invest the way we invest.  Someone must look at this.<\/p><p> I want to talk about the end of the journey from an entrepreneurial perspective and how we award or indeed punish entrepreneurial risk.  As I said earlier, there is financial risk from the start, but equally it is my belief that we get penalised when we retire from a business.  We grow a business and then sell it or whatever else we do to capitalise on that.  We retire and we pay an extraordinary capital gains tax rate of 33% in this country, which is completely at odds with other countries around the globe.  North of the Border is a very simple example.  Let us say two guys, one in Dundalk and one three miles north in Newry, grow their business and then they both sell it for &euro;5 million.  Joe Murphy in Newry pays &pound;500,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, which is not an insignificant sum in its own right; his cousin three miles south must pay &euro;1.4 million in capital gains.  It is wrong.  If we are serious about driving economic activity by supporting entrepreneurs, we must support them on the way in and we cannot screw them on the way out.  That is just the way it is.<\/p><p> The recession has changed all of us in this country, including the SME market, and Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh alluded to this earlier.  There is now a new breed of entrepreneur who understands our responsibilities in contributing to the prosperity of the nation as a whole.  This is driven by the knowledge that the Ireland in which we live today is the legacy of those who have gone before us, great men and great women who took risks and made sacrifices in order that we could have a better life.  Some paid the ultimate sacrifice in order that this nation could be free - free to have its own culture, language and identity and free to make its mark on the world, as we have done for generations.  Modern-day freedom comes from economic activity.  Economic activity and economic independence for a country the size of Ireland - a small, open economy - come from the generation of business and the creation of jobs.  More importantly, they come from international trade.  Irish entrepreneurs have never been in a better position than now to cross international waters to explore opportunities, exploit those opportunities, bring the spoils back to Ireland and contribute to the big elephant in the room that is our national debt.  We are creating jobs and the employment level is high but we still have the big issue of national debt.  There is no doubt but that the decisions we make and the actions we take and that members take - and I want to influence the committee on this if I can - will be the legacy of future generations.  There is now a window to make some of the changes I am speaking about.  If we make them, we will leave a legacy we can be proud of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Next is Ms Evelyn O'Toole, CEO of Complete Laboratory Solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#C00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, and the other members of the committee for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to represent the SMEs of Ireland.  It is a great opportunity and one for which I am very grateful.<\/p> <p>  I am an entrepreneur.  It started 24 years ago, when I was made redundant.  I am from outside Clifden.  I was based in Rosmuck in Connemara and I set up a company called Complete Laboratory Solutions, CLS.  CLS is a contract laboratory.  We are accredited to test food, water, environmental and medical devices, pharmaceutical products and clean rooms.  We also train up lab analysts in our labs and transfer them on to client sites around the country.  We are 24 years old and employ 160 people.  I decided to make this move very quickly after being made redundant because I did not want to leave Galway or Connemara.  Overall, we need a commitment at a larger level to people such as me who are willing to put a stake in the ground, to try to create something special and to create their own security, which, if they are successful, will create security for many more.  Ninety-nine per cent of our staff are scientists.  We are still operating in Rosmuck.  We also have a special facility in Galway city for pharma and medical devices.<\/p> <p>  Our route was such that we started very small and with a very small financial background, so I needed every support in the world to survive.  I did not look good on paper.  I think Paddy Power would have given me very poor odds.  My company is a great example of something that can go through if one gets the right supports.  There are different levels of support depending on the stage one is at and how the company starts up.  The first stage to note, which is really important, involves the local supports, the guys who understand and are in one's own locality.  I refer to the likes of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  They can pick people up, give them a lift and get them started.  Then, as one grows, the support needs grow, as do one's skill set and knowledge set.  Then a company becomes nationwide and then it becomes an international prospect.  At present we produce 12% of our income internationally without actually having an international structure.  This is where Enterprise Ireland comes in, and I must compliment our State bodies and supports because they are really good at what they do.  They interleave at different stages when companies need them to lift them.  Equally important are our business communities and ecosystems.  I refer to things like our connectivity, broadband and being able to conduct an international business from anywhere.  As Mr. Walsh said, we have a huge opportunity to become global players.<\/p> <p>  I wish to identify two challenges.  I think because of our economic success at present and the way things are driving, especially in the life science area, we are competing heavily for talent, so our resources on the ground are becoming quite sparse.  The attrition rate is costing a lot of money in training and retraining and onboarding people.  Companies in the SME bracket such as CLS are competing with the multinationals for the same talent.  This is an issue for SMEs, which are not on the same scale as multinationals.<\/p> <p>  I wish to identify two opportunities.  I think the SMEs and the multinationals can collaborate at a higher level.  I propose we make our multinationals the best of the competition within their corporate groups globally.  I think we can achieve this by two means: first, by supplying the best workforce they can get anywhere in the world, and second, by having the best supplier base.  The best supplier base comes from our bracket, the SMEs.  We are innovative, really efficient and really good at the non-core stuff in which the multinationals should not be involved.  Therefore, I think that by partnering closely and collaborating, the two largest factions of employers in Ireland, the multinationals and the SMEs, can produce a higher level of wealth, which we can turn into a bigger export opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Ireland should look seriously at developing a national strategy to give leadership in the area of female leadership opportunity, and we should become the best in Europe for this.  I think our partner will become the US because currently it is the leader in this area, but we have a real opportunity.<\/p><p>Diversity and inclusion are not only about gender or diversity more generally, they are about economics and the best economic driver and it makes business sense.  I can address that later in the questions and answers if members wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Evelyn O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I thank the Members of the Seanad for inviting me to this committee to take part in the consultation on small and medium enterprises, a sector which is the lifeblood of the Irish economy.  According to the CSO, SMEs make up 99.8% of all active enterprises in Ireland, accounting for 69% of all employees, 39% of Ireland's gross value added and 48% of the total revenue generated by Irish based businesses.  These figures demonstrate that SMEs are a crucial part of our economy.  They have played a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in the country and it is a sector that this Government is committed to supporting.  This support is needed now more than ever in light of the challenges facing Ireland next March with one of our biggest trading partners, the United Kingdom, due to leave the European Union.  It is important in these times that we continue to support the sector as a key source of employment and to ensure its continued growth.  It is not always possible to assist small and start-up businesses via the tax system.  Businesses may not be profitable in their early years and as a result may be unable to benefit from income tax or corporate tax reliefs.  However, our tax system has a role to play in supporting SMEs as one part of a wider support network.  A number of incentives are available within our tax system which directly or indirectly benefit SMEs, some of which were amended as part of this year's Finance Bill process.<\/p> <p>  In relation to corporation tax, the three-year start relief for SMEs which was due to expire on 31 December 2018 is being extended in this year's Finance Bill until 31 December 2021.  The three-year start up relief provides for relief from corporation tax for start-up companies in the first three years of trading with the value of the relief being linked to the amount of employers' PRSI paid by a company.  The relief was first introduced in 2009 as an incentive to encourage new business start-ups creating additional employment and has been extended and enhanced on several subsequent occasions.  Start-up ventures, most of which are SMEs, have a key role to play in generating economic activity and providing new jobs.  The three year start up relief supports the survival of new start-up companies, which in turn leads to a broadening of the corporation tax base.  A review of the relief, conducted by the Department of Finance and published on budget day found that the relief was an important support for new businesses.  In 2016, the relief supported 1,051 companies with 15,597 employees.  Based on expenditure cost &euro;5.7 million, the average cost per job supported in 2016 was &euro;352.<\/p> <p>  In speaking about SMEs, it is important to mention the research and development tax credit.  The credit provides a 25% tax credit for all qualifying research and development expenditure.  Where a company has claimed offset of the credit against its corporation tax liabilities and an excess remains, the company can make a claim for payment of the excess credit remaining.  The existing refundable element of the tax credit can be of particular assistance to companies that are not currently making profits and this can be of relevance to SMEs in a research and development phase as the credit can effectively part-fund the research and development activity and act as a valuable source of cashflow.  While there are no specific provisions for SMEs in the research and development tax credit, Revenue guidance was issued in February 2017 with the specific aim of reducing the administrative burden of the credit for relatively small claims for SMEs and micro-companies to encourage greater uptake of the relief by such companies.  I am aware that some other jurisdictions, including the UK, have specific research and development regimes for SMEs.  The research and development tax credit will be reviewed next year under the Department of Finance's tax expenditure guidelines.  On Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2018, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, confirmed that the review will include consideration of the potential for SME-specific provisions to be introduced into the Irish research and development tax credit regime in next year's finance Bill.<\/p> <p>  Income tax based incentives also have a part to play in supporting small businesses, many of which commence or remain as sole traders or partnerships or are small corporate businesses benefitting from income tax based supports.  Market failures mean that additional support measures are necessary to deliver financing and reduce costs to SMEs.  This has been especially true in recent years and a range of measures have evolved to fill the gap, including the employment and investment incentive and the start-up refunds for entrepreneurs scheme.  More recently, the key employee engagement programme introduced last year and the start-up capital initiative being introduced in the current Finance Bill demonstrate that we are ready and willing to come up with fresh solutions.<\/p> <p>  Small businesses need capital investment to survive and to grow and the tax system allows reliefs such as the employment and investment incentive, or EII, and start-up refunds for entrepreneurs, or SURE, to help businesses to source that funding.  Earlier this year, amid industry concerns that the EII was becoming bogged down in delays and red tape, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, commissioned a report to analyse the EII and SURE reliefs.  The report, published last month, makes several recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness the schemes, a number of which are being implemented in this year's Finance Bill.  Further improvements are set for consideration in the context of next year's finance Bill.  The most significant change in this year's Finance Bill is that claims for relief under EII and SURE are now to be made on a self-assessment basis.  This will allow for a more simplified application process and for companies and investors to engage directly with each other on matters which can be self-certified or determined without Revenue intervention.  To facilitate this process, the Finance Bill 2018 proposes a complete overhaul and simplification of the relevant legislation.  Over recent years, the legislation for EII and SURE was amended to such an extent that it is all but impenetrable to most readers.  A complete redrafting will mean that applicant companies, investors and their advisers will have much greater certainty and clarity on what the law actually is and how to claim the reliefs available.  The Finance Bill 2018 also introduces a new scheme that allows family and friends invest in certain early-stage start-ups, namely, the start-up capital incentive, or SCI.  Under the SCI, companies can raise up to &euro;500,000 from investors who are connected with current shareholders.  Family and friends are often the earliest investors in new micro-start-up companies and it is intended that this new relief will provide valuable support to these important new ventures.<\/p> <p>  As a business grows beyond the initial owner-operator phase, it becomes important for the continued development of that business to attract employees with new skills.  This can be difficult in a competitive employment market and small firms can struggle to match the pay packages that larger, more well-established companies can offer.  In 2017, the key employee engagement programme, or KEEP, was introduced to help SMEs to attract and retain talent through the use of share options.  The take-up of the programme has been less than expected since its introduction in January last with some in industry observing that it is overly restrictive.  To address this, the Finance Bill proposes relaxing certain restrictions and increasing the total value of options that can be granted to any one employee.  The Government is committed to ensuring that KEEP operates effectively and will continue to keep it under review in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these tax-based measures to ensure that they continue to provide the support intended.  As I have said previously, the SME sector is crucial to the Irish economy and the Government is committed to providing a business environment to ensure the sector, which provides a significant level of employment in this country, continues to grow.  I look forward to having a constructive conversation on the matter during the question and answer session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#D00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>The final contributors in this phase are the president and the director general of the Construction Industry Federation, Mr. Dominic Doheny and Mr. Tom Parlon, respectively.

As was already said, I am president of the Construction Industry Federation.  I live in Tullamore where I am an active member of the chamber of commerce.  I am past-president of the Midlands Gateway Chamber and the co-owner of a development construction company in Tullamore.  The construction industry is a critical part of the Irish economy.  All other sectors, including technology, finance, legal services and the public sector, depend on our industry for the accommodation and infrastructure the economy and society require.<\/p><p>When the construction industry works, Ireland works.  The medium-term prospects for the construction industry are generally positive following the introduction of the national development plan which outlined more than &euro;116 billion in investment over the coming decade.  There was an increase of 18.1% in the value of production in quarter 1 of 2018.  The value of construction output reached approximately &euro;20 billion or just under 7% of GDP in 2017 and most of this was produced by SME companies.<\/p><p> The construction industry is highly competitive and labour intensive.  Competition for work is based on a number of factors, the two most prominent being labour and materials.  Labour costs can account for more than 40% of a tender.  Therefore, stability with regard to labour costs and an environment where contractors can tender on a level playing pitch are of paramount importance to our industry.<\/p><p> The construction industry is recovering from the most severe recession in the history of the State.  It is essential that a framework exists that will ensure that Irish contractors employing Irish workers can tender on a level playing pitch.  Equally, it is essential that workers in the industry are paid a fair wage.  This, in turn, will ensure that we attract bright, young workers into the sector.<\/p><p> There are a number of other challenges facing the industry with regard to the demand for skills and the threat of building inflation.  Following a decade of flat costs, a recent development has been the upward trend in building costs and tender price inflation, with the latter running at 6.3% per annum.  The construction industry is experiencing a tightening in the supply of skilled labour, a natural outcome of almost a decade during which the number of new graduates and apprentices with construction related qualifications dramatically reduced.  The CIF is focused on ensuring that construction becomes a sustainable, long-term career option.  In the longer term, Ireland will benefit from filling skill gaps with students, apprentices and technicians developed through the Irish educational system.  In 2019, we will deliver a major awareness campaign to try to attract young people, including females, into our industry.  I call on the committee to support this campaign which we hope to roll out next year.<\/p><p> Another area that we have to address is public procurement.  There has been much coverage of the school building issue in recent weeks.  Without referring to the specific case, issues such as this terrible case are generally a manifestation of the failing of the public sector procurement system.  Under the Irish public sector procurement system, contracts are awarded to the lowest price bidder in the vast majority of cases.  This means that contracting authorities cannot award the contract to the best contractor with the best track record or the best plan to meet the design created by the Department.  This issue must be addressed or we will continue to see failures in delivery of public sector projects.  Given the importance of this specific issue, the CIF is holding a procurement seminar on Thursday next in Tullamore, where we expect to have almost 100 people in attendance.<\/p><p> The CIF also recommends that the committee consider the role of fairer procurement in terms of capital expenditure by the State with regard to safeguarding and developing Irish construction small and medium enterprises.  Our current procurement regime deals with everything but value for money for the client.  It is excessively focused on lowest price.  The price-quality ratio is important in public procurement.  As in any mature economy, it recognises that we should move towards the whole life-cycle cost of the infrastructural asset.<\/p><p> Our position is fully captured in the sustainable procurement programme that we are currently pursuing with Government.  At present, construction as a sector is characterised by low profitability and productivity compared with other sectors in the economy.  With low margins, it is not possible to compete to deliver cheaper solutions.  This is where technology and fairer procurement will play an increasingly crucial role, not only helping us build smarter new infrastructure but also improving how our current operational assets perform by focusing on the whole life of the asset.  We need only look at the assistance our friends in agriculture and their SMEs obtain, specifically through their State agency, Teagasc.<\/p><p> From Ireland's perspective, the timing of the implementation of the national development plan, NDP, and the national planning framework, NPF, is essential to meet the critical physical and social infrastructure and the needs of a growing country, especially in areas such as transport, housing, health and education.  The industry, therefore, welcomes the fact that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established a Project Ireland 2040 delivery board with senior representatives from all of the infrastructure investment Departments to oversee the implementation of the plan and ensure fluid project management.  SME businesses in construction and investors, designers and providers need certainty of the forward work programme, something which the new NDP should provide.  The capital projects tracker, which is under development, should lead to a liquid pipeline of infrastructure opportunities.<\/p><p> Another positive development to emerge from the new NPF-NDP is the establishment of the construction sector group, which will work to ensure a regular dialogue between Government and the construction industry.  It is widely acknowledged that a healthy, sustainable, competitive and well-functioning construction industry which offers good long-term quality employment and construction output is essential to the development of the goals of the NPF and the delivery of the priority projects outlined in the NDP.  Policy actions in the areas of skills development and research and development should aim to accompany the national strategic outcomes identified in the NDP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Doheny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I will be brief because Mr. Doheny has covered most of the issues.  We also had eloquent presentations from both Mr. Walsh and Ms O'Toole.  I was just thinking of an old country and western song by Kris Kristofferson and the line, \"You've been readin' my mail.\"<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh spoke of issues such as financial support, support for innovation and not taking advantage of entrepreneurs, which is our big worry.  Mr. Doheny compared construction with agriculture, an area in which the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and I have a background.  I heard Ms Tara McCarthy, the chief executive of Bord Bia, on one of RT&Eacute;'s chat shows on Saturday last praising the fact that our food and drink exports are worth in excess of &euro;12.5 billion.  As Mr. Doheny stated, we are turning out &euro;20 billion worth of work in construction and employing more than 150,000 people.  There is not a Minister for construction or an advisory service such as Teagasc.  We are largely left to our own devices.  There is no incentive to invest.<\/p> <p>  I noted a couple of words the Minister of State used in outlining the supports available.  There are supports and I do not intend to be negative.  The Minister of State mentioned accessibility and some supports being impenetrable and excessively restrictive.  By virtue of running their own show, owners of SMEs have less time than others and may not be focused sufficiently on paperwork and red tape.  That is the area in which support is needed.<\/p> <p>  The construction industry must embrace innovation.  This is not only an Irish problem, but a global problem.  Off-site fabrication is the way to go.  Some Irish entrepreneurs in the United States are just about to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in off-site fabrication for houses that would speed up construction.  They are in California which has experienced a horrendous fire in which, on top of an existing housing problem, wiped out 25,000 of the state's finest houses.  One can imagine where that project will start.<\/p> <p>  It is timely for both Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and the Seanad that we are embracing this area.  Construction is the lifeblood of the economy.  The big foreign direct investment, FDI, companies are extremely important to the economy but construction has employed an extra 1,000 workers each month for the past 30 months.  If there was a Minister, he or she would be cutting ribbons and making announcements every other day.  We never get a look in, however, because this employment is spread across many areas.<\/p> <p>  I regularly walk in and out of Leinster House where a fine construction job is under way.  It is being done by an SME from Templemore, Duggan Brothers.  The company is proud to be working here and is getting on with the work.  I am sure the innovation it is using is state-of-the-art.<\/p> <p>  In terms of support, the industry needs better access to finance.  The banks have become extremely risk averse.  A large foreign multinational company will get money it does not need but companies taking a risk are finding it extremely difficult to access finance.<\/p> <p>  On house building, Home Building Finance Ireland was announced in the 2018 budget but has still not materialised.  I acknowledge there are issues.  We are informed the legislation may be before the House before Christmas.<\/p><p>Small construction companies need access to money without having to give their life away.

We heard about potential global players, opportunities, innovation, collaboration, capital and access to funding.  I liked the emphasis Ms O'Toole placed on diversity because it is a valid and strong point.  When we talk about diversity, perhaps sometimes we view it in its narrower sense.  What do we need to address to encourage the culture of enterprise and innovation in our people?  I refer in particular to the formation of a culture of enterprise and innovation in education through thinking about enterprise and the need for implementation in the educational system.  How do we encourage people to be successful in business?<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that some of the successful role models in business have very limited education.

Ireland exists outside of Dublin, even though most people think that it does not.  I have seen that many counties have been neglected, especially in the area of employment.  Ms O'Toole decided to keep her business in Connemara, which is commendable because she is creating employment there.  As a female, what can she do to encourage other young women to have the courage to start up a business and remain in rural areas?<\/p> <p>  I started a suicide intervention charity in 2006 and the economic crisis hit us a couple of years later.  One of the awful things about that was an immediate rise in suicides among construction workers.  I heard Mr. Doheny state it was not possible to get the personnel that are needed.  Is there a project in schools to encourage young people to consider construction as a possible career path?  I refer in particular to apprenticeships.

It is particularly commendable that they located their businesses near where they live.  I also congratulate Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on making us focus on this important issue.

The panellists are sitting beside the Minister of State, which presents them with a great opportunity.  As small business entrepreneurs, what do they think of these measures?  Have they benefitted from them?  Are they SME-friendly?  From the point of view of those on the front line, are there ways in which these measures could be improved?  Do they work?

Many years ago, in our previous lives, Mr. Walsh sold me a diet feeder.  Both Mr. Parlon and I were dairy farmers in the past.  I have been making the point for a long time that many people start up business with a good idea but do not understand that the reason to be in business is to have a margin and achieve a profit.  A person can have the best idea in the world, but if the structures, background and supports are not in place, he or she will not survive in business.<\/p> <p>  We are not good enough at delivering that message from day one.  Day one is in secondary school when we should provide courses on entrepreneurship and how to establish and structure a business.  We should all take stock of that, whether we are involved in a representative body or a company.  Mr. Parlon and I were both involved in a company.   We all have to understand margin because it is crucial.  That is one issue.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Senator Kelleher, the EII, SURE and KEEP schemes provide tax benefits that result in tax foregone.  We analyse these schemes.  A point was made about exiting the research and development measure.  The reason we changed the research and development structures and applied self-certification was to ensure additional cost is not incurred for hiring professional services such as accountancy and other advisers.  We analyse and change the schemes.<\/p><p>As each Finance Bill comes through each year, following each budget, we try to ensure that if we do not have the uptake that we would like we analyse why.  The KEEP scheme is the best example.  We got a lot of representatives from companies that found it difficult to be competitive due to an inability to attract staff.  Due to being back to full employment those companies were unable to be as competitive as the larger foreign direct investment companies.  We thought that the KEEP scheme would be a good opportunity as it means a person can have a share option in the business, retain the shares and choose to exit as they require funding.  Unfortunately, uptake has been poor and that means something is wrong.  We are quite satisfied that if the uptake is poor, it is a pretty good indication that something is wrong with the design or workings of the scheme.  I do not take that criticism personally.  I take the criticism that we have not designed a scheme well enough.  If we have not designed it well enough then we are satisfied we will try to ensure that we design the scheme better.  <\/p><p> I wish to highlight the following to Senator Kelleher.  The paternity benefit was a big benefit in the last budget.  While it has always been the case that when family came along maternity leave played a crucial part, it is important to give an opportunity to dads who are working, which people forget.  We want to do more in this important space.  Yesterday, members will be aware of the announcement of 45 professorships that will be available to females only.  That is a space that is very original and innovative.  I always point out to people that we have come out of a hellfire of a decade in business and I know because my business has traded through that decade.  There will be more opportunities to do these things in the next decade.  Unfortunately, we did not have that opportunity in the last decade when we just tried to keep the lights on, which we have done.  I hope, for the next decade, that we will have opportunities to do more for women in business, particularly because they are a hugely untapped resource.  Many women have good ideas and we would like to encourage them and give them the benefits of advancing because, like Ms O'Toole has said, jobs revolve around ideas.  Whether a person is male or female, we want to ensure there is an opportunity to create jobs, and indigenous jobs, whether they are in Connemara, in my own neck of the woods in Wexford or in the other corner of the country in Donegal.  It does not matter where it is because wherever there is an idea, jobs will flow.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#F00800","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Does Ms O'Toole want to answer a question or two?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#G00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Yes.  I thank the Minister of State for his comments and thank Senators Freeman and Kelleher for their questions.<\/p> <p>  In terms of nurturing participation and getting more female and male entrepreneurs in the system, I will put a little more emphasis on female entrepreneurs.  It would be helpful to make things easier, give a little bit more security and lean more towards a more customised version of what might work for females.  One of the most common comments that I see is, in terms of training and investing in developing female entrepreneurs, is that sometimes there is a challenge between being carers and mothers and there are challenges with going overseas.  For example, when Mr. Walsh and I chatted here earlier we realised we have a lot in common.  We are finalists or winners of the Ernst and Young, EY, competitions.  We both participated in the leadership for growth programme.  Mr. Walsh said that it was one of the most important programmes that he did and the same applies to me.  In 2014, when I participated in the course there were 23 Irish owners of SMEs of whom two were female.  In 2000, I undertook the business development programme at the Irish Management Institute, IMI, and I was one of 19 business owners of whom two were female.  Women's representation has consistently scored below par.  From what I have heard on the ground, the cost of promoting a business overseas is prohibitive so having local education and upskilling for females will help a great deal.  It will mean that women will not have to leave their responsibilities that they fulfil for the rest of the time.  I represent mothers on this issue as I have got a lot of feedback from them.  <\/p> <p>  It would be good if female entrepreneurship was funded exclusively.  Enterprise Ireland raised a special fund for such an initiative but, unfortunately, there was a very low uptake.  We need to revisit the initiative and perhaps change the structure; sometimes it is not the money but the structure or a lack of a soft skill that is at issue.  Let us create a better structure.  Recently a group of us came up with the idea of a residency for entrepreneurs.  People would be placed with a company and given all of the benefits of the structure of the company and align with it to see if we can create female entrepreneurs in higher numbers.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland, in line with Europe, has a rate of 9% female entrepreneurs.  Going back to diversity and inclusion, and with special emphasis on the female piece here, Ireland has a huge opportunity to be a leader in Europe.  At present the number of entrepreneurs here are just about on par with the rest of Europe.  We can create a plan for Ireland to be leaders in this area.  In the US post-war as part of the tender process for public procurement a tickbox was included in the application form which meant the applicant failed or pass.  The tickbox sought to identify whether companies had a policy to include minority groups.  If one did not have a policy to include females then companies were not awarded the contract.  Companies started to include minority groups to comply with the tender application and win contracts.  Surprisingly, over time it was found that the companies that committed to inclusivity performed better financially than the companies that did not.  The initiative not only makes gender and leadership sense, it helps the economy and businesses.  As the Minister of State has mentioned, a business has to be formed, created and lead in the finance area.  If a business does not make financial sense then it will not survive.  Therefore, we want something sustainable that makes sense.  We have a real opportunity now and Ireland should do this.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Evelyn O'Toole"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>To address the question on how to create an entrepreneurial culture, the Minister of State mentioned that we should make entrepreneurial studies part of the curriculum at secondary level.  While that is important, starting in secondary level is too late.  The seeds of entrepreneurship need to be sown around the kitchen table where families talk to each other, thus entrepreneurship becomes the language of families.  I firmly believe that entrepreneurship should be taught in primary school because primary schoolchildren have a fantastic relationship with their teachers, there is no exam points race and teachers are very influential.<\/p> <p>  A great Kerry entrepreneur called Mr. Jerry Kennelly started the outstanding Junior Entrepreneur Programme.  My company in Carlow is very fortunate to sponsor the programme and I saw at first hand the real impact it made on young kids and on their thinking.  All we were trying to do through the Junior Entrepreneur Programme was to say to young kids aged 11 and 12 to put entrepreneurship on their menu of options once they go through the education system.  I would urge children to go through the education system, get a third level degree and a master's degree, if desired, but try entrepreneurship at least two or three years down the line.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State made the important point that careers change.  I am convinced that in the future every individual will have between two to four careers in their lives and, therefore, must keep an open mind.  I hope one of their careers will be entrepreneurial.  I moved from Kerry to Carlow and joined a company called Keenan Systems, an outstanding livestock feeding company.  The experience I gained from working for that company gave me enough confidence to do something for myself but, like Ms O'Toole, I had the skillset to back that up.  I admire entrepreneurs who start a business straight after leaving school.  The entrepreneurial mindset comes at a very early stage when families discuss business at their kitchen tables with their children who attend primary, secondary and third level education.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Freeman mentioned that Ms O'Toole and I built our businesses outside of Dublin.  Ms O'Toole built her business in Galway and I built my business in Carlow.  I think it is far easier to build a company outside of Dublin and slightly disagree with what the Minister of State said.  In rural Ireland entrepreneurs do not set up businesses to make a big amount of money, revenues or profits, which is the result of doing the right things and doing them better than anybody else in the world.  That is why my company grew in Carlow.  Netwatch rose from the ashes of three great companies that went into demise - the sugar factory in Carlow, Braun and Lappin.  The three companies at their peak employed 4,000 people out of a working population of 15,000 in the county of Carlow.  One can imagine the devastation their closure caused in the region.<\/p><p>I am a Kerry man, but Carlow people are incredibly resilient.  There are some outstanding companies in Carlow that came from the ashes of those companies such as Netwatch and Burnside Autocyl which employs 800 people in Carlow under the radar.  There are also Autolaunch and Keenan Systems where I worked, as well as an Irish whiskey business and so on.  When someone grows and builds a business in a place like Carlow, there is a burning desire to make it work because he or she is in the local community, rather than being lost in a large conurbation.  The profits and everything else come later.  The Government's role is not to give us a hand-out but a hand-up by creating the appropriate conditions.  As I said at the start, I am looking through the lens of international trade.  The Government should give us the ability and put the structures in place to allow us compete in international markets and beat the large organisations, which is critical.  <\/p><p> I am enthusiastic about what the Minister of State said about the research and design tax credit and its simplification.  As I mentioned, it was designed for SMEs to encourage them to develop and invest in their research and design departments, but some 75% of it goes to multinational organisations, only because they have the infrastructure to make it happen.  During the years I have noted two debates, one of which is about the indigenous sector versus the multinationals, but, as Mr. Parlon rightly said, we need each other; it is a symbiotic relationship.  Similarly, the media love the debate about the private sector versus the public sector, but we are all on the one side.  Simplifying the research and design tax credit system as an incentive for Irish companies to invest, innovate and grow is the right thing to do.<\/p><p> The Minister of State did not address my final point.  It is penal for Irish SME owners who grow their business, put in all of the hours which, as Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said, can be more than 100 a week, and sacrifice their families and private lives to grow a business, until a day comes when they want to sell their business.  There is a belief that perhaps when somebody sells a business, it disappears, but it does not.  It gets far stronger.  A simple example is a company in Waterford, namely, Eirgen Pharma, which is an outstanding pharmaceutical company, the founders of which grew it to a certain point, sold it to a large multinational organisation and it has since trebled its workforce.  These SME owners are penalised when they sell, but when they sell, they try to invest somewhere else.  They are paying capital gains tax at a rate of 33%, which was 20% before the recession but grew.  The entrepreneurial community played their part by meeting and trying to make budgets match, but the matter needs to be addressed.  We try to get people in at the start and while it is true that they focus on their career path, being screwed at the end is wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I was asked three questions by Senators Buttimer and Freeman which were related to education, what we could do to attract more people into our industry and what could be done about the issue of mental health in the context of boom and bust cycles.<\/p> <p>  On education, Mr. Walsh alluded to it and I fully agree with him.  We have had a substantial discussion in the construction industry on the stage at which we should try to attract people into the industry.  I will speak specifically about construction, but the Senator is correct that leaving it until secondary school is too late.  It needs to happen at primary school.  There is a significant ongoing debate about apprentices and how we can attract people into apprenticeship schemes and so on.  The stereotype career paths are promoted all the time in secondary school.  I have three daughters and, when we did the milk run to secondary schools in Tipperary, an apprenticeship career path was never discussed.  It was all about third level attainment and which school had the largest proportion going on to third level.  Some of the best engineers I have come across such as electrical and mechanical engineers took the apprenticeship route first.  We need to get into primary schools and it could be done in a fun way.  The Minister of State is right that it starts around the table, but for that to happen the parents must be brought on side.  For us in the construction industry, owing to the recession and the number of people who left the country to seek employment abroad, parents need to be brought back on side.  As I said in my presentation, we will embark on a serious promotional campaign for the construction industry early next year, in which one can have a worthwhile career.  <\/p> <p>  We were asked what we could do to attract more people to our industry, through innovation and so on.  We have discussed the matter.  Our SME colleagues have also discussed it in the context of research and design and so forth.  Teagasc which I mentioned is one of the best innovators in the agriculture industry.  That industry, much like the construction industry, is primarily made up of SMEs, but most of the innovation happens within Teagasc.  It develops it to a commercial level and then sells it to the industry through SME farmers and so on.  We need a similar approach in the construction industry.  Project Ireland 2040 outlined a construction centre of excellence, which we are trying to promote to be akin to what the agriculture industry has in the form of Teagasc.<\/p> <p>  On mental health, an issue raised by Senator Freeman, there were major issues during the downturn.  Ours was probably the most seriously hit industry in that regard.  It has partnered with Pieta House to seek professional help and assistance for its members.  We also strongly promote health and safety.  A few weeks ago we had a health and safety week.  There is, however, a legacy and, unfortunately, we must deal with it.  It is a difficult issue and, regrettably, many of our members are no longer around because of it.  How do we resolve it for the new people and companies, many of which survived the downturn?  The Senator asked about future-proofing the industry to take us out of the boom and bust cycle.  As I said, one of the best opportunities is offered by education, not least apprenticeships.  Once someone has an apprenticeship card, it is tradeable anywhere in the world.  We are not promoting the export of our people, but at least they have something on which to rely if they move abroad.  It is then up to us to try to attract them back when some sustainability returns.  <\/p> <p>  Under the national development plan, the announcement of &euro;116 billion in capital investment over ten years represents significant expenditure which will reach every corner of the country.  All of our SMEs will be able to take advantage of it, but we cannot afford for it to be back-ended.  It must be spread evenly over the ten year period in order that our SMEs will have the opportunity to tender for the work.  There is a practice in our industry called \"bundling of contracts\", which means that if there is a bundle of schools or courthouses, for example, it is taken out of the scope of our SMEs.  That must change.  Procurement which my colleagues and I mentioned needs to be seriously looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Doheny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Mr. Doheny gave credit to Senator Buttimer for asking a question which my old colleague, Senator Boyhan, asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Mr. Parlon knows me well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#H00400","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":609,"content":"<p>The question was a good one.  It was about encouraging a culture of entrepreneurship, from which we are moving a little.  People want to be professionals and part of large companies.  There are many reasons for this such as pension schemes, early retirement and being able to do all sorts of things.  We should return to encouraging that culture of entrepreneurship, but the question is how to do it.  Some of the roadblocks need to be removed.  If one takes a risk, one must receive some allowance for taking it.  Self-employed persons work extremely long hours and there is no overtime, for example.  In our industry we very much embraced diversity.  While we are diabolical in getting women to work in the industry, we have superb role models.  Tomorrow evening in a local hotel there will be an event for women in construction, at which some of the superb role models who work well in the industry will tell their story.  That is one way by which we are trying to spread diversity.<\/p> <p>  We must encourage the culture of entrepreneurship across the board.  We have our own challenges and must compete with every other sector, which is a challenge.  I mentioned the additional 1,000 people every month, but we have exhausted nearly all of the low-hanging fruit.  Yesterday morning I flew to Amsterdam on a work trip to look at Dutch house design.  As I walked through Schiphol Airport, which is a massive place, I was smiling because three separate people said \"Howya, Tom.\"  It was like walking down the main street in Birr.  It was because the Aer Lingus flight had just arrived and construction guys were heading off to go about their daily business.  We are involved in an international business, but, as Mr. Doheny said, we should encourage people to acquire the skills here.<\/p><p>If someone becomes a qualified electrician or tradesman, he or she has the opportunity to go on to third level, but that presents a difficulty.  If he or she is not in a position to do so, his or her employer or parents will have to put their hands in their pocket to fund it.  If someone automatically decides to fill in the CAO application form, there will be a college place for him or her somewhere, he or she will have a wonderful five or six years in college and come out with a degree, but he or she will then start having to learn how to work.  If someone chooses to enter into an apprenticeship scheme, he or she will have to find an employer, fund himself or herself and get to work every morning.  It is a tough grind, but it is certainly worth it.  How do we promote it?  We should make it a little easier for young people to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh whose knowledge of and passion for small businesses has opened my eyes and ears.  I come from a health background where it is more difficult to understand small businesses.  With Senator Freeman, I worked in psychiatry for over 30 years.  During the years of the downturn we gained a new diagnosis term - ecoside - suicide caused by the economic downturn - and it involved men.  Looking at the list of delegates, of the 23 presenters, five are women.  At the time we wondered why it involved men.  Obviously, enterprises are male-run.  The delegates are, however, very welcome and I also thank them for teaching me.<\/p> <p>  I will make a few observations, rather than asking questions.  I say, \"Well done,\" to Ms O'Toole and Mr. Walsh for helping to prevent the depopulation of rural Ireland.  The projections show that by 2035, 70% of us are going to live in cities, which is going to cause its own major difficulties.  I hope Ms O'Toole and Mr. Walsh will buck the trend with the quality of life and employment they offer and keep people in the country.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the issue of female representation, to a certain extent, we have done it in politics through the 40% quota.  We have also done it in academia.  How can we do it in apprenticeships, which are so important?  <\/p> <p>  The delegates have told me eloquently about their own experiences.  It seems that women lack the traits of finance and e-commerce which seem to be more male traits.  Therefore, we may need to embed them even as early as primary school.  They seem to be more male than female qualities.  I am terrible at maths.  The teaching of young girls and women in this area might be approached in a more gentle and enjoyable way in order that they might develop the capacity to carry these skills through and that they will not be scared off.<\/p> <p>  A point was made about apprenticeships.  There is a push to encourage more females to take them up, but apprenticeships seem to be valued less than third level education courses.  We appear to have become a society which sees third level education as a rite of passage, as an easier life for four years, rather than actually getting out and doing the hard graft in setting up one's own company.  Apprenticeships needs to be supported and promoted because we do not all have the opportunity to meet the cost of third level education.  We need to put apprenticeships on a par and stop devaluing them in the eyes of society in general.<\/p> <p>  Not much has been said about broadband.  The fiasco that has happened and that is going to stall its provision has been touched on.  As a Dub, I cannot get over how anything is done down the country.

There is an inversion of this also, which serves us well.  We supply fully trained analysts to the same guys that we compete with.  We are a small to medium sized enterprise, SME, competing with a multinational.  The same market is taking our guys through the recruitment and we are also supplying them part of their headcount.  We can be part of the correction of that by agreements with them.  I think I speak for the industry when I say that the smaller guys find it more difficult to compete with the bigger guys in terms of security.

Under the German model, apprenticeships are a very sought after career path.  It is not only relevant to construction, it is also relevant to the health, medical and finance sectors.  It is something Ireland does not really tap into at all.  I would definitely promote this aspect.<\/p> <p>  I can make some personal comments on the issue of working remotely.  I am the director of an innovation centre in Tullamore that is owned by Offaly County Council.  The centre provides hot-desking facilities.  It is very interesting to see the number of people taking up that facility who previously worked at home but who need the social interaction of other people, while wanting to mountain their solo working.  We provide them with hot-desking, which is extremely successful.  One of the offerings is fast broadband to serve their needs.  Perhaps this is a way of rolling out broadband to the rural areas; bring it to innovation centres first before it is rolled out anywhere else.  At least then people can come together collectively and work from those bases.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred to rates.  Commercial rates are a very topical issue in the area from which I come.  We all know that councils must balance their books at the end of every year but if we lose our rate base in regional areas through major closures and so on, then the rates will be increased for those of us who are still around.  It is up to the powers that be to make sure we continue to have a set of supports.  The Senator referred to IDA Ireland and foreign direct investment in rural areas or the regions.  That needs to be maintained and increased if we are to have sustainable business plans for those of us left in the regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dominic Doheny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I wish to make a point about remote working and about Senator Devine's comments on broadband because they are completely related.  There is a cultural change happening in Irish businesses where business owners now see the value of employees working remotely, ideally from home.  It ticks all the boxes around traffic congestion, car travel and so on.  It is, however, all dependent on broadband.  I deal with companies that measure output not input.  They do not care about a person's location provided he or she does the right job and works within the parallel lines of the ethics and culture of the organisation.  Broadband is critical.  Consider where we are located in Carlow town.  We are very fortunate that we have broadband for our communication to the world.  Our company does remote video monitoring.  If I went to Tullow or Rathvilly, I would be scuttled because broadband is not available.  We have 200 people working in Ireland, of whom some 70% or 80% are working in and within 25 miles of Carlow.  I would say that 75% of those people could not work from home even if we wanted them to work from home, because they do not have the communications.  The roll-out of the broadband plan is critical.  That matter was not raised at this meeting because it has been discussed so often.  We have been beating our drum on this issue for long enough.  The roll-out needs to happen.

I thank the witnesses very much for coming and for the time they have put in.  It is important, despite the small number of Senators we have here.  The contributions set out in all their submissions are very much taken on board, as will be the case with the presentations and information they are about to share with us.  I said earlier that companies do not grow; people do.  It is all about our people.  There are a couple of factors.  I used to teach maths and I think visually.  If one thinks of three circles which interact in the middle, one will be the entrepreneur, business person or SME and the supports they get.  The witnesses' organisations support them in a key and fundamental way.  The other part of it will be the employees and the people.  An entrepreneur or SME can only do so much alone.  Support, commitment and that work ethic together are also needed.  The third area is the environment within which they work, namely the State, and the way we as legislators in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il can work proactively to help those three circles to be in sync to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to start up, run and grow a business.<\/p> <p>  We had entrepreneurs and SME representatives before us earlier, including Netwatch which employs 600 people, 200 of whom work in Carlow.  The company pays out more than &euro;8 million a year in salaries to people in Carlow, which is a major contribution.  The best thing one can do in life is give a person a job.  If one gives a person a job, one provides the opportunity for independence, integrity, choice and so on.  One gives a person options.  I am passionate about this particular aspect of the work I am doing in the Seanad, about the support and contribution of the witnesses and about those three circles working very much in synch.  My colleagues on the committee are committed to this as well.  It is not a political issue and we are all here together wearing the same jersey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#M00200","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us.  I am joined by my colleague, Mark Christal, manager of our regions and entrepreneurship division.  Enterprise Ireland's remit is to support companies engaged in manufacturing and internationally-traded services.  We also have a responsibility as an organisation for foreign direct investment, FDI, in the food and natural resources area.  The majority of companies with which we deal are SMEs across a wide range of sectors located in every village and town in Ireland.  Our focus is on helping those companies to start, develop their business and grow internationally.<\/p> <p>  We have ten offices around the country and work in close partnership at local level with a range of enterprise development partners, including local enterprise offices, business innovation centres and the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland.  Funding for those bodies comes through Enterprise Ireland.  In addition, we administer on the direction of Government various schemes, the most recent example of which is the online retail scheme introduced to support retailers to bring their businesses online.  At the centre of everything we do as an organisation is helping companies to build scale and expand their reach.  That is a focus of our 2020 strategy, which aims to help companies to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 from the existing record level of just under 210,000; increase exports to &euro;27 billion; increase annual spend in Ireland by an additional &euro;4 billion, and inspire more companies with global ambition to scale their businesses, including Netwatch, a company to which Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referred.  I am pleased to note that in 2017, the companies we work with experienced record employment growth of close to 210,000 direct jobs.  There was almost the same increase again in indirect employment.  That involved the creation of 10,300 net jobs.  That employment growth was experienced across all regions, counties and sectors.  We have 33 offices around the globe and they support our clients to build their exports.  Exports were at a record level of &euro;22.7 million in 2017, which represented an increase of 7% on 2016.  Importantly, we have been focused with clients recently on diversifying their businesses.  We have seen clients reduce their dependency on the UK, which is our closest market, from 45% to 34% over the past ten years.<\/p> <p>  Our work in the start-up area is about assisting entrepreneurs to realise their ambitions.  Through our new frontiers programme and 14 institutes of technology nationally, we have supported 326 years over the past two years.  We have also supported 91 businesses and start-ups through our competitive start fund and 90 businesses through our high-potential start-up fund.  Innovation is at the centre of most companies and we have assisted clients to build their innovative capacity.  We have supported more than 100 companies in terms of spend in excess of &euro;100,000.  We have also approved funding for 436 innovation partnerships in technology gateways throughout the country in 2017 and provided financial support for over 1,000 collaborative innovations between industry and higher level education organisations.  At the beginning of 2018, we launched an agile support under research and development to respond quickly to the needs of companies that are innovating and to provide them with support.<\/p><p>On market diversification, which is about spreading companies' risks across export markets, one of the key activities Enterprise Ireland is involved in is helping companies win new customers in international markets.  It is critical to get that first customer and we helped in excess of 1,300 companies secure new contracts in export markets in 2017 and helped 350 companies establish new presences in international markets.  We also brought 870 international buyers to the country to encourage and help them secure business from Irish companies in 2017.  At the beginning of this year, we launched a new support to help companies further drive their exports and internationalise their business and that was called the new market discovery fund.  That is to accelerate companies' efforts in trying to diversify their business with the pressures from Brexit.  Competitiveness is important in that area and it is critical that we help companies maintain their competitiveness, not just in Ireland but internationally.  In 2015, we collaborated with the local enterprise offices to pilot a lean offer for them for smaller businesses and I am pleased that the number of companies that have gone through that programme now exceeds 1,100 so that has now gone mainstream.  We also launched a new operational excellence offer at the beginning of this year.<\/p><p> On regional business ecosystems, we work closely with our parent Department on new schemes.  The new regional economic development fund, REDF, under which the Government committed &euro;60 million, was launched last year .  There were two calls in that, the first of which allocated &euro;30 million to regional initiatives and the second of which was for 21 successful projects around the country.  The second call is well advanced at the moment and is currently being assessed.<\/p><p> There are many challenges facing SMEs and we have set them out in our submission to the committee.  I highlight two that are currently relevant, namely Brexit and attracting skills and getting good people.<\/p><p> On Brexit, we have done much work as an organisation, not just for our clients but for companies to help them prepare for Brexit.  We launched a Brexit scorecard with which companies can self-assess their exposure to Brexit and more than 3,190 companies have completed that to date.  Actions emerged from that to help them respond to Brexit and better prepare themselves.  We also provide grant support in that area and we have been undertaking Brexit roadshows around the country, both national roadshows and Enterprise Ireland roadshows.  In excess of 940 participant companies in that area attended the roadshows.  The roadshows are focused on helping companies to identify the issues in their business that they particularly face and then to respond and act on the initiatives.  We back up that information in support of companies and take action on the areas of risk that they have identified.<\/p><p> Attracting and retaining skills is critical to SMEs and we are in the fortunate position now where unemployment levels are much lower than they were five to ten years ago, particularly five years ago.  What has been critical for those companies is that recently we launched an initiative called Spotlight on Skills, for example, which is a workshop to help companies identify their own skills needs and to develop a plan for addressing same.  To date, we have engaged with 140 companies on those skills workshops, representing 16,500 employees.  That helps them to prepare to secure the skills that they need today and that they will need to develop their business in the future and helps existing employees within the business, as the Senator has indicated, to grow their own capabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The ISME submission is on the record of the House and I do not intend to read it.<\/p> <p>  On the macro risks that we pointed out in our original submission, since we wrote that, the UN Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD, has confirmed an outflow of US foreign direct investment from Ireland between the first half of last year and the first half of this year of $81 billion.

We conduct primary research to address knowledge gaps in the UK which underpin enterprise policy and also knowledge curation - making knowledge available to policymakers more effectively in the UK.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that as I have to run for a plane but Ms Bourke will provide some information to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Roper"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>We thought it would be useful to make the committee aware of some new data on microbusinesses in Ireland.  This data were collected as part of an international project by the ERC.<\/p> <p>  Microbusinesses are businesses that have less than ten employees and they comprise more than 90% of businesses in Ireland.  In 2016, there were approximately 250,000 microbusinesses in Ireland, employing 27% of the workforce in businesses.  These firms are critical to future productivity and job growth.  However, we know little about microbusinesses in Ireland, because they are excluded from most Government and academic surveys.  For instance, the innovation in Irish enterprises and the Irish innovation panel excludes firms with less than ten employees.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, with support from the UK Government, the ERC undertook a survey based project focusing on the activities of microbusinesses in the UK, Ireland and the US.  This project provides new data on innovation, growth ambition and digital diffusion for microbusinesses.  Data were collected from 1,500 firms in Ireland and larger samples in the UK and the US.<\/p><p>I will talk briefly about three themes of the data, namely, ambition, innovation and digital adoption in microbusinesses in Ireland.  On growth ambition, previous research has linked owner-managers&rsquo; growth ambitions to the subsequent growth and performance of the firm.  Looking first at respondents' aspirations for their microbusinesses, we consider the proportion of respondents ranking each aspiration as important or very important.  The data suggest a sharp distinction between the 71% of Irish respondents who aim to keep their business similar to how it operates now, and the more ambitious 27% who aim to build a national or international business.  The 27% figure in Ireland compares to 22% in the UK and 18.2% in Northern Ireland.  Individuals&rsquo; personal ambitions suggest a rather different set of priorities, with a marked emphasis on freedom and flexibility.  This is consistent with much of the research literature on self employment and entrepreneurship which stresses the financial, as well as the non-financial, benefits of being your own boss.<\/p><p> Turning to innovation, we consider two indicators relating to whether microbusinesses introduced new or improved products or services over the three years prior to the survey, or new business models or forms of organisation.  On both metrics, microbusinesses in Ireland are ahead of those in the UK and the USA.  In addition, the percentage of microbusinesses undertaking innovation is relatively uniform across the country.  Another innovation indicator, the proportion of sales derived from innovative products or services, provides an indication of the extent to which firms are able to derive sales from their new products or services - a measure of innovation success.  In the year prior to the survey, Irish firms derived around 11% of their sales from innovative products or services compared to 9% for the UK and 10% in the US.  This means more than &euro;1 for every &euro;10 of sales in Irish microbusinesses comes from new and innovative products and services.<\/p><p> The adoption of information technology has been one of the key drivers of productivity across advanced economies over the last three decades.  The advent of Industry 4.0 presents businesses with new challenges relating to digitisation in both selling and operations.  Our microbusiness survey provides the first robust benchmarks for digital adoption in firms with fewer than ten employees in Ireland.  The survey focuses on five established digital technologies and two emerging digital technologies, namely, artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Generally, adoption rates in Ireland compare well with those in the UK and are markedly higher than those in the USA.  Approximately 40% of microbusinesses in Ireland are using web-based accounting software and cloud computing, compared to around 20% in the USA.<\/p><p> Our aim is not to make public policy recommendations for Ireland but to make the committee aware of the new data on microbusinesses.  If the committee would like further analysis of the data, we would be more than happy to provide it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jane Bourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Mr. Sven Spollen-Behrens is director of the Small Firms Association and Ms Rebecca Harrison is managing director of Fishers of Newtownmountkennedy Limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#O00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>The Small Firms Association, SFA, represents a diverse membership of businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

We have grown from a small country clothing shop to a multidepartment store with concessions.  I set up Food at Fishers Limited, a daytime caf&eacute;, in 2013.  We have 32 employees in total and there are five other small businesses operating on our site, employing a further 12 people.<br\/><br\/>I fully support the SFA&rsquo;s call for a national small business strategy and I congratulate this committee for undertaking a public consultation process to examine the creation of an integrated proposal document supporting the fostering, growth and sustainability of indigenous Irish SMEs.  As an owner-manager of growing businesses, I would like to see all parts of the State system get behind small businesses like mine, especially those in the regions and rural areas, so that we can scale, grow and create employment.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that there are many State supports for small firms, given by Government Departments and agencies.  I am involved in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation&rsquo;s retail consultation forum.  The forum has proven to be very successful in gaining an insight into the retail sector specifically, and we are delighted to see some real action following the forum&rsquo;s recommendations, and those of the organisations here today, such as the recently announced online retail scheme via Enterprise Ireland, and the excellent <i>supportingSMEs.ie<\/i>website.  I have also availed of the trading online voucher through the local enterprise office, LEO, to maximise our sales potential online and used the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, loan scheme for some capital expenditure.  Furthermore, I have engaged with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAl, in relation to upgrading our lighting and heating for cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency.<br\/><br\/>A small business strategy would create coherence in all policies and instil a business-friendly approach in public officials across the apparatus of the State.  As an owner-manager, I would like to see greater understanding from Government officials and political parties of how small businesses work, our concerns and unique challenges, and I believe that all proposed legislation and policy decisions must be assessed for their impact on small business, instead of just on large business.  I am a retailer and caf&eacute; owner and these sectors have come under increasing pressure from rapidly rising input costs, regulation, access to finance and taxation.<br\/><br\/>I have several key areas that I would like to address in the proposed strategy.  The first is labour.  This forms one of the largest costs, in terms of both time and money, within my businesses.  The impact of each increase in the minimum wage is felt most profoundly by SMEs.  Our staff are key people and are the most important part of our business.  They are not on the minimum wage but their rates are linked to it so our labour costs increase every time the minimum wage rises, substantially increasing our total cost base with no corresponding increase in sales.<br\/><br\/>The proposed introduction of restrictions in pay and working hours, such as banded hours, and other mechanisms to restrict allowances for seasonal fluctuations worry me greatly.  They will lead to laying off people completely or to increased labour costs, to such an extent that the business will no longer be viable.  The proposed introduction of auto-enrolment pensions would be a cost too much for my business to bear.  Access to good labour is also a problem facing many SMEs.  The welfare system, in its current format, is still discouraging employees to work more than three days a week, as their benefits will be lost.  A transformation is needed in this area to allow employers to access more hours from their trained and experienced staff and reduce the Government's welfare bill.  The impact of these issues go directly against the Government's objective of increasing jobs.<\/p><p> The cost of utilities and insurance was mentioned previously.  The high cost of energy is rightly encouraging us to become more energy efficient.  I was delighted to see grant supports through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland being made available to SMEs recently.  However, in my experience of applying, the burden of information required leads the grant to be inaccessible to many SMEs, even those working closely with a certified electrical contractor, as I was.  The need for a consultant to complete the application form defeats the purpose and negates the benefit of the grant, especially for an SME whose total spend is smaller but for which every penny counts.  This process must be made simpler and more accessible.  We have seen several key insurers leave the retail sector recently, reducing competitiveness and increasing costs.  My own business has had to move to a UK based insurer to get cost-effective cover but that relationship is now in jeopardy with the onset of Brexit.<\/p><p> On taxation reform, as a self-employed worker, I would support tax changes that allowed me to invest in my business and to attract and retain skilled employees, especially as we enter full employment.  In addition, more Revenue guidance in several areas to assist small firms like mine to reduce the cost of tax administration would be welcome.  Specifically for me in the retail sector, I would welcome an ability to pay VAT weekly or even automatically at the time of sale to spread payments rather than paying a large lump sum.  Also welcome would be substantial reformation around employer and employee taxation such as fewer restrictions on gift voucher incentive schemes, employer PRSI and assistance with PAYE modernisation.  For SMEs, cashflow is our biggest barrier to growth so any schemes that can assist with this to regulate the flow or bridge the gap would be transformative for our ability to grow.<\/p><p> Turning to the regulatory burden, there are many regulations facing all businesses and while many are excellent initiatives, it seems unfair that the burden and therefore the cost is always placed on the business.  For SMEs, this forms a substantial part of our cost base.  I refer, for example, to costs in analysing ingredients for allergen legislation, installation and high ongoing costs of health and safety initiatives, food safety paperwork and procedures and other areas, alongside continuing professional development, CPD, which we conduct anyway.  It seems that while each Department introduces new initiatives, the cost impact on the SME owner of one initiative coming on top of another is not considered.<\/p><p> It is now more important than ever that a mutual trust is developed between the Government and SME owners.  Discrimination against the self-employed continues, for instance, in the gap referred to earlier between the earned income tax credit and the PAYE tax credit as well as in welfare supports.  It seems that the Government does not trust us to conduct our business properly, yet we operate in an environment that is so burdensome that it is impossible to do anything other than conduct our businesses correctly.<\/p><p> In recent decades, Government policy has been successful in attracting foreign direct investment.  The focus must now shift to SMEs.  It is time to create a strategy for growth for indigenous small businesses with a special focus on taxation reform, competitiveness and the cost of doing business, especially considering Brexit and the uncertainties surrounding it.  The Government must deliver on this commitment to creating a small business strategy in order to gain trust among the self-employed.  Any initiatives seeking to foster growth and sustainability for indigenous Irish SMEs must also support this much-needed key policy change.  This is the biggest step the Government can take to encourage more people to go into business for themselves.  More businesses mean more jobs, greater levels of innovation, increased tax revenues and more vibrant local economies.<\/p><p> On my own behalf and that the Small Firms Association, I thank the committee for affording us this opportunity to submit our views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Harrison","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":649,"content":"<p>From IBEC and sharing their time, we have Mr. Fergal O'Brien, director of policy and public affairs, and Mr. Gerard Brady, head of tax and fiscal policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#P00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation.  I will make some brief introductory comments on what we see as the broad trends in the enterprise sector and the economy at the moment.  My colleague, Mr. Brady, will address the specifics we have laid out in our submission.  I share the view of previous speakers that while we have a very dynamic group of indigenous businesses that perform cutting-edge innovation across a range of sectors, applying world class technologies and in many cases performing very strongly on a global scale, we have no doubt that the SME and indigenous sector is not living up to its full potential.  We identify a number of policy levers that could significantly improve the environment for SMEs in Ireland.  I will comment on what we see as very significant trends in the Irish economy over the last half decade or so that I think will bring significant opportunity and challenge for the SME sector if we do not react in the right way from a policy perspective.<\/p> <p>  By far the most significant trend of the last half decade has been the hyper-globalisation of the Irish economy.  This has brought incredible success in terms of employment in our multinational sector.  We have seen the quality of multinational activity increase and strengthen significantly in terms of the nature of the roles, depth of innovation, and world-class quality of manufacturing that is happening here.  Ireland is now one of the most open, globalised economies in the world.  The multinational sector that is active in Ireland is performing at a level on a par with any other developed economy and in most cases beyond our competitors.  Unfortunately, some of this success brings us very significant challenges.  More than in any period in the last 15 years, we think the economy is now facing very significant risks.  It is facing competitiveness risks from an internal policy perspective and, as has been mentioned, some very significant external risks.<\/p> <p>  Examining the manifestation of the success of the multinational sector, one of the clearest indicators we have is that our corporate tax revenue has more than doubled in the space of four years.  This gives us a significant opportunity in terms of the resources at our disposal but it also brings us a risk if we do not apply those resources correctly.  To date, the main focus of public policy has been to put that corporate tax bonanza into the day-to-day costs of running the country.  That is adding to the cost base and competitiveness challenges of the SME sector.  We urge the committee to examine the source of the revenue from which the Exchequer is now benefitting - more than &euro;5 billion in four years - and to ask how we can use this really important source of business tax to better invest in the economy and make it more sustainable for all enterprises.  The reality for the SME sector is that the cost of business is going up because of the wider success of our economy, whether through competition for labour, the cost of rent or the cost of business services in the economy.  We are losing competitiveness very rapidly and right now we are not reinvesting the fruits of the success of the multinational sector.  That &euro;5 billion surge in corporate tax is not being invested back into infrastructure to create better business conditions for all businesses, back into an innovation environment or back into the skills that we so desperately need for this economy.<\/p> <p>  We are potentially at an inflection point for the economy.  We have performed incredibly strongly over the last years.  We have a risk around the imbalance we are seeing in this corporate tax surge and the implications for competitiveness elsewhere in the economy.  If we reinvest the proceeds properly, we can really improve business conditions for SMEs.  If we do not, we will accentuate and make worse the competitiveness challenge that the SME sector is already facing.  My colleague, Mr. Brady, will outline some of our specific solutions for the SME sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I will give an overview of the five key areas we identify in our submission to the committee.  We can get into more detail in the question and answer session.  The first area that we think is lacking in supports for SMEs is investment, including helping business and SMEs to invest as well as the environment for people who wish to invest in SMEs.  Irish small businesses, compared to their European counterparts and those elsewhere, are overly reliant on short-term bank financing and particularly on overdraft financing, which is a more expensive and more volatile source of resources.  Our equity mix is pretty poor compared to other countries, as is the availability of equity financing, which could diversify that funding source.<\/p><p>In that context, the employment investment and incentive scheme, EIIS, has taken a big nosedive, particularly over the last year or so.  A huge number of our members used it in its successful previous guise, the business expansion scheme, BES.  In the first quarter of 2018, the take-up of that scheme was down by about 50% on the previous year, despite the turnaround in the economy over that time.  There are big issues to do with state aid rulings there.  Some of them have been dealt with in the Finance Bill but there is an ongoing need to improve support for companies looking for equity investment rather than relying on short-term bank financing. <br\/><br\/>The second area we drew attention to was Brexit protection.  We are all discussing some of the things we would like to happen for our SME sector but the reality is that without at least the semblance of a deal over the coming months, it is very hard for any SME to plan.  That is particularly true of those relying on the UK in the food sector and traditional manufacturing.  Those companies will need support.  They have got some in the budget.  They have got some resources for borrowing from Government, as well as new longer-term borrowing provisions, which are welcome.  However, in the event of a harder Brexit or ongoing uncertainty, some companies will need more direct supports than are currently available.  That may require changes to state aid rules, for example allowing for a temporary state aid regime, from our European colleagues.  Another element of the Brexit issue is that a huge amount of companies will now quite possibly have to deal with the UK as a third country for the first time.  That will mean huge changes in the way they must interact with their suppliers and the people to whom they are selling.  The import VAT regime is a huge worry for a lot of our companies because it could have a significant impact on cashflow in the event of a hard Brexit. <br\/><br\/>The third area we drew attention to was the innovation performance of small Irish companies.  Particularly, we looked at mid-cap and small companies.  They have pretty good innovation performance across the board, but they are not in the top tier of European companies of their size.  This is crucial to their growth.  We can examine the mean support throughout the State for small companies, or for all companies.  The take-up of the research and development tax credit among SMEs is very low compared with what it is in the UK.  Other countries have simplified <i>pro forma <\/i>versions of the onerous regulatory forms involved in claiming a research and development tax credit.  They have separate <i>pro forma <\/i>versions for SMEs, which help them overcome some barriers, particularly the costs involved in claiming a credit when professional services must be hired. <br\/><br\/>Our fourth issue is management capacity and skills.  International research shows that Irish SMEs have poor management capacity when compared with some of our neighbouring countries and that we are in the lowest third internationally.  Growing that management capacity is going to be increasingly difficult for companies because of the tight labour market.  They will struggle to compete with the multinational sector on wages.  That has been mentioned already.  A huge amount of that is down to the fact that they just cannot afford to pay the same kind of wages on a salary basis.  The best option from the State's point of view therefore is to allow them to use their equity to try to hire key staff through improving share option schemes.  The key employee engagement programme, KEEP, has been mentioned before.  There are some improvements to it in the Finance Bill but on the other hand, KEEP has seen some reversals in other areas of the Bill.  If that scheme does not work there really is no differentiator or support for hiring when firms cannot match multinationals in competition for skilled workers, particularly at the C-suite level where mid-cap companies are trying to expand.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, I refer to a point that has been made already about regulation.  We appeal to the committee to encourage an approach of thinking small first when it comes to regulation.  A huge amount of regulation is aimed at corporates but does not take into account the impact on owners of SMEs.  That impact is felt in terms of time more than anything; owners who could be putting their time to more productive use must deal with significant regulatory burdens.  There are good examples of how regulation can be improved and made to suit SMEs, but there are other areas where we could do with more help.  In particular, by international comparisons the State is pretty poor at doing regulatory impact assessments when it comes to introducing new regulation.  An improvement in the use of regulatory impact assessments could have a knock-on impact in the time available to owners of SMEs and their ability to run their businesses and grow them for the benefit of the whole country.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Our last speaker in this session is Dr. Tom Healy, director of the Nevin Economic Research Institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#Q00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":654,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh agus a Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, go raibh maith agaibh as an deis seo chun labhairt libh.  I want to make three points in this presentation, which is a summary of many other points made in our written submission.  The first is that SMEs have been a huge success in weathering the storm of the downturn.  Many went under; many just about survived at huge personal and family cost, as was mentioned by Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh earlier.  The second point, reflected in previous comments, is that we ought not to be complacent.  The domestic enterprise sector, particularly SMEs, is vulnerable, and the performance is not what it could be relative to other northern and similar European countries.  I refer to performance in terms of productivity and global market share.  The third point is there is scope for many different approaches and many different forms of ownership.  That can include partnerships involving voluntary, for-profit and State involvement, including municipal enterprises and various different forms of entrepreneurship.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on several policy points or recommendations that ought to be considered.  The first comment by Mr. David Walsh from Netwatch was that personal risk and the punitive terms sometimes exacted by the banks from people setting up enterprises are real barriers to entrepreneurship.  I would like to suggest that an enhanced social insurance arrangement for all the self-employed would provide a safety net, a stronger protection against loss of income or business failure.  This could help entrepreneurs to fail and start again and not to be inhibited by the enormous personal costs involved in businesses that do not succeed.  <\/p> <p>  The second point I would like to make is that we have a lot to learn from other European countries, particularly Germany.  I hope we will hear a little bit more in the next session about the role of different regional banks in funding small and medium-sized enterprises.  In the context of Brexit there is an opportunity for the British and Irish Governments, the European authorities and the European Investment Bank to consider an investment vehicle that could not only lend to businesses in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but could also provide information and support services, working with Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  A third policy point to which I wish to refer is the importance of devolution or delegation of power from the centre.  The local enterprise offices could play a much stronger role in identifying supply linkages and opportunities for SMEs to develop better and stronger links with larger companies and multinationals.  <\/p> <p>  A fourth point concerns the mix of different ownership types.  I will mention the huge role of community co-operatives in generating electricity in Denmark and providing power to the national grid.<\/p><p>This was part of a carefully crafted strategy over three decades that weaned Denmark from its dependence on fossil fuel imports.  We are 85% dependent on fossil fuel imports and we must radically change that.  Small and medium-sized enterprises, including possibly community co-operatives and other joint efforts involving equity holdings, for example, by investment banks and by public utilities, could be effective in making that transition to a zero-carbon economy.<\/p><p> The final policy point is the role of education and training.  It appears from the data on workforce and management skills in SMEs in both the Republic and the North that there is a deficit.  That must be part of a long-term plan involving apprenticeship training and a lifelong learning culture that is embedded in the way institutions of education and learning link in with enterprises at a local level, creating pathways of lifelong learning and upskilling and retraining members of the workforce.  In the context of Brexit it is clear that inevitably there will be a huge loss of jobs in some sectors and regions.  We must work on replacing those jobs in new markets, new enterprises or new lines of activity. <\/p><p> M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas as an &oacute;c&aacute;id seo.

It is wonderful to hear the Gaeilge.  It is popular in this Seanad because Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh uses it on so many occasions he baffles me, but I am getting there.<\/p> <p>  I jotted some notes that occurred to me but they might not necessarily be in order.  My first question is for the representatives of Enterprise Ireland and Dr. Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute.  It is about succession plans.  A PwC survey in 2016 found that only one in seven Irish small and medium businesses had robust succession plans and half of those surveyed had no such plans.  We are approaching the demographic challenges arising from the retirement of the 1950s baby boomers.  Succession is an issue the EU has raised as a concern.  It will impact on 600,000 people per year.  France, Italy and Scotland have moved to introduce what is known as the worker co-operative buyout.  Dr. Healy has spoken about this a little with regard to different types of enterprises.  Has Enterprise Ireland carried out research on that to find out if it is possible to introduce that or strengthen it in Ireland?  What are Enterprise Ireland's views on a co-operative buyout model as a viable solution to succession issues?  I say that in a context where we are experiencing a cultural shift that will come to the fore in the next generation.  The cultural shift is towards being more socially aware of injustices and seeking social justice.  The co-operative model would dovetail with that.  Could it dovetail with small and medium enterprises as well?<\/p> <p>  Brexit is the biggest and messiest divorce around.  The news flash is that there is a text of a deal between the UK and Europe and apparently it has been agreed.  However, it is a media leak.  We have been in this position previously so we will not hold our breath.  The issue is the growth in exports.  According to the Enterprise Ireland global market report for 2017, just 1% of Irish exports go to Latin America and 9% go to southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India, despite those locations representing approximately half of the global population.  Some 34% go to Britain but that will be extremely uncertain.  It is important to diversify.  Enterprise Ireland teamed up with Google and brought Google's digital garage of free online tools to the regions.  It is a positive initiative.  Has it yielded results or is it too early to say?  Is it captivating small and medium businesses?<\/p> <p>  Returning to the cultural shift, our planet is deteriorating rapidly.  The environmental impact is bringing forward climate change as well.  If we have fewer skilled people chasing the many jobs being offered and if there is a dearth of a skill, people will have more choices and value will have to be added.  Are small and medium enterprises involved in reducing the carbon footprint, reducing emissions and opting for microgeneration of its electricity and selling the excess to the grid?  That is the added value the next generation in the cultural shift will be seeking.  Climate disaster is probably ahead of Brexit.

I come from the ranks of the self-employed.  I set up my accountancy practice when I was 28 years old.  People said I was mad but I did it for 12 years.  I am relatively rare as one of the self-employed who went into politics.  I have a background in politics, but the risks are enormous.  I was that soldier.  When I started out I heard Albert Reynolds tell a great story about pressure.  There is huge pressure with Brexit now but he was speaking in the context of the Northern Ireland talks.  He said pressure is going out on a Friday night and calling to six or seven dance halls knowing that if one does not lodge IR&pound;10,000 on Monday morning one is out of business.  That is pressure.  Will the witnesses give their views on credit from the banks?  Cash is king.  In particular, what is ISME's view of the small business sector's interactions with the banks?<\/p> <p>  This meeting is very worthwhile and we should have more of them.  I was unable to be here earlier due to commitments at constituency level.  I was interested in Mr. McDonnell's view on broadband.  Perhaps he would expand on that and on whether that train has left the station.  When Eircom was sold it was a little like buying a house when the value of the house was the copper in the roof rather than the house.<\/p><p>The value of Eircom, now Eir, was in broadband and the possibility of a broadband network.  Eir and many other operators have already invested significant sums in fibre broadband.  I am interested in the witnesses' thoughts in that regard.<\/p><p> The Small Firms Association spoke of a national small business strategy.  I do not know if Enterprise Ireland or the local enterprise offices are represented today.  Enterprise Ireland represents indigenous firms, many of which are small and medium sized enterprises that enter the export market.  IDA Ireland look after multinational and foreign companies locating here.  Typically, the local enterprise offices deal with firms which employ ten people or fewer.  Who caters for domestic businesses that have been operating for three years and are now expanding?  This cohort of firms has always felt it was being let down.

This type of engagement, whether it relates to small and medium sized businesses, mental health or other issues of fundamental importance to society, allows people to tell us what is needed.  This process is fundamental for democracy.<\/p> <p>  I was very much taken with what Ms Rebecca Harrison said.  Her family has been in business for more than 40 years.  The majority of businesses in Ireland are family businesses.  My colleague, Senator Devine, referred to research that found that one in seven SMEs do not have a succession plan.  Why is that the case?  One reason is tax which prevents people from moving on and another is that some people do not want to go through the stress that family members have gone through running a business.  There are two issues to keeping a business going.  The first, the financial side, is what everyone talks about.  However, the elephant in the room is the stress it causes because every day is about trying to survive.

Dr. Healy spoke about banks and personal guarantees.  I have been subjected to the practice to which he referred and almost lost my house.  I did everything I could to grow a business.  He also referred to an enhanced social insurance scheme.  These kinds of things are important.  Social insurance reduces the level of stress because it helps to provide for a family, whether someone is a man or woman.<\/p> <p>  The need for a much stronger role for local employment offices was raised, as were the issues of ownership types, education and training and life-long learning.

Six years ago, between 7% and 8% of the start-ups Enterprise Ireland supported were led by females.  We saw this as a fundamental issue.  Last year, we supported 181 start-ups, of which 63 - or 28% - were female-led.  We are putting a focus on the area, providing specific supports, providing a female-led competitive start fund, providing mentors who are specifically focused on female-led enterprises, providing support in terms of networks, and encouraging and putting a spotlight on the area.  Obviously, we will not be satisfied until we get that to 50% - 28% is more than half way there.<\/p> <p>  The UK is the most important export market for indigenous companies.  That will continue to be the case.  Last year, exports to the UK grew by 4%.  The good news is that over the past ten years, exports into the UK have continued to grow, but exports to other countries have continued to grow at a faster pace.  Exports to Asia-Pacific countries grew by 9%.  Our exports to the US grew by 7%.

In the case of Latin America, we are starting from a lower base and they are more challenging markets to enter.  It is about focusing on the areas where Enterprise Ireland clients and Irish companies have specific expertise and capabilities that match the needs of those markets.  For example, this week we have a trade mission in Germany led by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, focused on medical devices.  There are two leading medical device trade shows.  Last week, we had a trade mission to China which was focused in Hong Kong on financial services, led by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and also mainland China.  On Thursday evening, we have a major financial services event in London.

In managing the succession of businesses, it is key to have strong emphasis on the breadth and capability of a management team so that when owners move on, a strong management team is ready to take the business on.  In the area of training, mentoring and management capability, programmes we run, such as Leadership for Growth and Innovation for Growth, and training programmes we support with the LEOs across the enterprise spectrum are critical at that point of succession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Christal"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>We are very conscious that climate change is an issue.  Carbon costs small businesses money, but the problem is that carbon generates a lot of money for the State.  Decarbonising will need to push revenue elsewhere and everyone needs to think how that will happen.<\/p> <p>  GDPR is cost additive.  It is too early to say what the ultimate implications will be for businesses.  We do not want to see it become the next slip, trip and fall.  There is real concern that could be the case.  Nobody has absolute rights.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann allowed us to execute people up to the 1970s.  It recognised a balance of rights between public and private.  It cannot become an absolute right for privacy.  One of the big areas in which we are seeing privacy having a negative impact is on insurance.  There is push-back on a claims database because people do not want to share who all these really unfortunate people having a large number of accidents are.<\/p> <p>  On credit, everyone is saying we are too dependent on the pillar banks.  There are alternative networks that are potentially functional in Ireland, most especially the post office network and the credit union network.  We really need to think how we can use those sensibly.<\/p> <p>  The significant issue underlying the national broadband plan is the commercialisation of the last mile, especially in rural areas.  Figures in excess of &euro;2,000 per household have been mentioned.  I am not our policy guru on this, but I am rehearsing what he has been saying in the media lately.  By way of analogy to our gas and electricity networks, we have not sold those networks.  We have kept the skeleton and sold access to the network commercially.  That is why we think it is a viable proposition to purchase back the network.  It could be done without taking it on the balance sheet because there would be a ready-made customer base to do it immediately.  Despite some of the stuff in today's media that the way ahead is through 4G and 5G, we do not see that as being adequate for long-term cloud-based solutions where everything happens in the cloud.<\/p> <p>  While we may be seeing a solution to the withdrawal part of Brexit, one of the commentators last week referred to Brexit WTF - withdrawal, transition and future arrangement.  In the long term, the issue will be about the regulatory and non-tariff framework.  That will especially impact on food exporters.  However, Revenue could make a contribution.  There is no absolute necessity to collect VAT and customs duties at point of import when the UK becomes a third country.  Revenue could treat the UK in that way for tax purposes.  We understand the impact on cashflow could be relaxed if Revenue so determined.<\/p> <p>  We were asked for our top three.  A strategy is the one thing that unites all of us.  When ISME, IBEC and the SFA agree we need a strategy, we need a strategy.  The OECD will tell the State the same thing next year.  A really simple point at which to start is the German federal Government's top ten for the Mittelstand.  Second is competitiveness.  It is more important for a peripheral nation to be competitive than it is for those at the core.  We are just about as peripheral as it is possible to get now.  The third thing would be sustainability in everything - our public sector finances, value for money for same, our debt level, our environment and bringing in the circular economy.  Those would be our top three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":678,"content":"<p>IBEC is working across our membership with SMEs and large energy providers on a business roadmap for carbon reduction.

The witnesses are all welcome to this third session in our review and analysis of small and medium enterprises in Ireland.  The committee intends to draw up a White Paper that will pull together all the key strands of thinking in this area to help create a coherent strategy on the development and growth of SMEs in Ireland.  Rural and regional area are very important.  Small and medium enterprises are the key factor in sustaining rural areas because they give people a job.  The support provided by the organisations represented today is vital in helping people remain in rural Ireland.  While achieving growth in our cities is good, it is not in their best interests, by a long shot, to focus on them and allow rural Ireland to decline and decay.  The witnesses' work is critical and their feedback to the committee is essential for the creation of a national uniform strategy for small and medium enterprises.  They have already made valuable written contributions, which we have collated.  The information they will share with the committee will add to that body of work.  We hope to publish the report towards the end of January or in early February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#W00600","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":700,"content":"<p>That will depend on your good self, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#W00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I and, more important, my parliamentary assistant, will do our best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#W00800","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;in, CEO of the Western Development Commission, to make his introductory remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#W00900","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; as an gcuireadh a thabhairt d&uacute;inn.  As the newly-appointed CEO of the Western Development Commission, I am delighted, on behalf of the commission, to briefly cover some of the issues we raised in our submission.  I will seek to give a sense of the role and work of the commission and the area it covers, which extends from County Donegal down to County Clare, the key issues and challenges facing the western region and some of the solutions that arise.<\/p> <p>  The Western Development Commission is a statutory agency charged with fostering and promoting economic and social development of the region extending from Donegal southwards to Clare.  It is important to give some of the defining characteristics of the region.  Some 65% of its population live in rural areas outside centres of 1,500 people, while 80% live outside urban centres with a population of more than 10,000.  The key towns, as members will be aware, are Galway, Ennis, Letterkenny and Sligo.  This discussion is important because it puts foreign direct investment in context.  Small and medium enterprises are vitally important to the 80% of people in the western region living outside urban centres.<\/p> <p>  On the work done by the Western Development Commission, an analysis of census figures shows that in 2016, 54,000 SMEs and only 50 large enterprises were registered in the seven counties of the western region.  Between 2008 and 2016, the number of active enterprises in the western region declined by 4.3%, whereas it grew by almost 4% nationally.  Despite the recovery in enterprise numbers in recent years, all counties in the western region now have fewer enterprises than they did in 2008.  A higher share of the western region's enterprises operate in sectors that rely on domestic demand, including construction, accommodation and food services, other services, wholesale and retail.  This throws up specific challenges for medium-sized towns and villages in these rural areas.<\/p><p>We addressed these in detail in our submission so I will only briefly touch on a number of them.  As members would expect, connectivity is a key issue but we do not have any motorway north of Tuam.  On broadband infrastructure, even when broadband is introduced take-up is an issue and this needs to be addressed.  Mobile phone coverage, which is often taken for granted, is also an issue.  Other issues include funding for regional seed and early stage venture capital funding, declining populations and the demographic of the western region and pressure from online retail.  Sometimes we find that the isolation in networking opportunities is a challenge for SMEs.<br\/><br\/>Before I proceed to the work that we are doing, I will first note that the Western Development Commission is undertaking a strategic review.  In this regard, the work of the committee is timely and we will take it into account as we look to the five years ahead.<br\/><br\/>Between 2001 and 2009, the Government provided &euro;32 million for the western investment fund.  This fund has grown and in 2017 the Western Development Commission invested about &euro;4 million between seeding and venture capital funding.  There is an investment fund for the creative industries known as the WRAP fund, a micro-loan scheme for the creative industries and we support accelerators in life science and ICT.  This is almost a unique model in Europe.  Over the lifetime of the Western Development Commission, it has invested more than &euro;50 million and funded 150 enterprises, creating in the region of 5,000 jobs.<br\/><br\/>The Western Development Commission is active in policy analysis, analysing issues such as those we are discussing in this submission, on which my colleague, Ms White, worked with me.  In addition, we have the website, <i>www.lookwest.ie<\/i>, which changes the narrative around the west.  Rather than focusing on some of the critical indicators I have outlined, it sets out the key advantages the west offers in terms of work-life balance, affordable living and the opportunity the area holds.  We are also involved in sectoral EU co-funded projects in areas such as renewable energy and the creative industries as well as in new projects in tourism, the blue economy, aquaculture and business mentoring.<br\/><br\/>I will now address some of the challenges we have identified and some of the solutions we can offer.  We have been very active in addressing the lack of regional seed and early stage venture capital.  It is worth noting that in 2018, only 26% of venture capital funding in the State went outside the Dublin region.  One project in Limerick accounted for 19% of all venture capital funding, meaning the rest of the country accounted for only 7% of the national figure.  We need to incentivise risk-taking and private investment in the tax regime.  This is vital for the work of the Western Development Commission and other agencies to because we need funding to be matched or balanced.<br\/><br\/>A pipeline of talent is another key challenge.  We need to identify people who are available and match their education and skills.  This is something that has been identified by foreign direct investment and large companies.  However, it exerts pressure in turn on the smaller and medium companies because they cannot compete for that talent.  In that regard, work is being done on the issue of structured and flexible working to allow people to work from home and on a flexible basis.  This increases the attraction of SMEs and allows them to compete.  The Western Development Commission is developing a tool to ensure this pipeline is developed and can be built.<br\/><br\/>Broadband has been mentioned several times today.  I should highlight, in particular, the take-up of broadband and the options available to people when broadband comes to an area.  Sometimes it is as important to do the follow-on work to ensure that when broadband becomes available, people understand all of the opportunities it offers.  We are involved in this work.  This issue needs to be viewed in the context of the need for SMEs to be active online and to compete with international markets and large international retailers.<br\/><br\/>We must ensure the metropolitan area networks are competitive and offer opportunity.  Rural mobile phone coverage is vital and is often taken for granted.  We must ensure it is no longer an issue in this day and age.<br\/><br\/>Without labouring the point, I will address the issue of transport.  Analysis done by the Western Development Commission shows that within the western region, 72% of workers commute by car, compared with 65% nationally.  Transport links are vital, as is energy infrastructure because it also attracts foreign direct investment.  It also has a multiplier effect which gives SMEs the ability to leverage existing infrastructure to improve their opportunities to grow.<br\/><br\/>I thank my colleagues.  As I am the incoming CEO, I acknowledge the work of those who have gone before me.  As I mentioned, my colleague, Ms White, is with me today but I also thank my other colleagues in the Western Development Commission.  The challenges that face SMEs are not only economic problems.  As Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh pointed out, they are the platform on which social life and communities can grow.  Sustaining jobs is important for communities so the importance of sustainable employment cannot be overstated.  Ar an mbonn sin, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l don choiste in athuair agus a r&aacute; go bhfuil an Coimisi&uacute;n Forbartha an Iarthair tiom&aacute;nta go huille is go hioml&aacute;n chun na hoibre seo le cinnti&uacute; go mbainfimid na spriocanna seo amach.<br\/><br\/>On collaboration, I am keen to have the Western Development Commission work with other State agencies in joining the dots and communicating because many State supports are available.  The State agencies should work together to make people aware of these supports.  We should be cohesive and act in concert with each other to meet the challenges I have outlined and I am sure my other colleagues will outline today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#W01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid thar a bheith s&aacute;sta an deis seo a fh&aacute;il &oacute; na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; agus an Cathaoirleach a bheith anseo ag labhairt thar cheann &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an t-eagras forbartha r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach a bhfuil freagracht aige as forbairt eacnama&iacute;och, s&oacute;isialta agus cult&uacute;rtha na ceantracha Gaeltachta tr&iacute;d an oile&aacute;n.

I also thank Deputy O'Dowd in the Gallery and my colleagues.  I thank all for being here and for inviting Irish Rural Link.  I will not go through the full statement.  The committee already has that so it is on record.  To put it into context, Irish Rural Link is a community organisation founded in 1991.  We have the honour that one of our founding members, Michael D. Higgins, is now President of Ireland.  We are glad to say that he has kept in touch with the work we do.<\/p> <p>  In a line, Irish Rural Link is about sustainable rural communities.  If we take nothing else from that, we remember that phrase.  Under our remit we have a wetlands forum, which is designed to maximise employment and the social and economic advantage to the area from wetlands and bogs, which are now coming into the news.  We also have the scheme for refitting houses which we organise with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  This allows ordinary rural houses, which are extremely unsuited to the challenges arising from the current carbon debate, to refit under the aegis of the SEAI.  We also have the meals on wheels network, which is one of the most important groups in the country.  The incredible work done mainly by women who deliver meals on wheels to people who are housebound is to be seen on every boreen from Donegal down to Kerry.  The groups also run befriending services.  Many lives are saved by these women who, in delivering a meal, discover that a person needs a lot more.  These groups have to be brought together and we compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his work in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of digital hubs and so on, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment we run a major programme of computer training.  This provides free training on computers which allows people to go online.  It is essential given the isolation in rural areas.  We are also involved in policy advocacy, which the committee will see in our submission on banking.  We are also involved in advocacy on broadband, which as my colleagues have already pointed out, is one of the major infrastructure projects required in rural Ireland if we are to make any fist of keeping people at home and, more importantly, working because the biggest problem we face is that younger people are not staying in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>They are gravitating to where the jobs are.  The real jobs seem to be more in the cities, unfortunately; for most families, including my own, more of the younger people are in Dublin than where they were reared.  That is a real problem we need to tackle very quickly.<\/p><p> On the economic model, what we have put forward is based on our studies with the Sparkassen in Germany, which are local, regional, not-for-profit banks.  Some Members of the Oireachtas have visited Stuttgart.  It is a hub in terms of creating employment in a very wide region.  It is a hub because the 200 year old local public bank is effectively the driving force.  We have a problem; some of the figures were cited by my colleague in the Western Development Commission.  We have had a decline in small business of, I think, 4%.  Nearly every single job created in rural Ireland is in a small to medium-sized enterprise.  We are talking about as few as five people working in a business.  The worst thing we can hear is that this area is declining.<\/p><p> As the credit review report which monitors lending into the region points out, there is a high rate of credit refusal.  The figure for the exact rate varies; according to ISME, it is around 36% while the credit review committee says it is 11.8%, which is the highest in Europe.  We have to ask ourselves how long small businesses can continue to apply for funding only to find themselves refused or for the process to take so long that even when they appeal and are successful, the time for the business plan or the idea is gone.  We have had members come to us to say they cannot even get cashflow support.<\/p><p> Instead of Irish Rural Link complaining about what is not happening, we have put forward a definitive proposal on how rural banking can be established, particularly examining local banking which could apply to the Dublin area as well.  We put three years of research into this.  There is now a stakeholders forum coming together.  We believe and hope that hurries up and the terms of reference are published.  We need it now.  The gap between rural parts of Ireland and the cities is widening and will continue to widen.  <\/p><p> We have made it very clear that broadband is the infrastructure, the blood and the reality in terms of creating up to 10,000 jobs.  I think it was the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who conservatively suggested it would create 10,000 jobs per month, yet we are still not delivering that programme.  We really cannot allow any excuse, no matter what it is, to delay that process.  On economic development, we had the 2040 launch by An Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, not too long ago.  This plan goes right back to the Buchanan report, back in the 1960s under Se&aacute;n Lemass.  Had that report been implemented, it would have completely changed rural Ireland.  The 2040 plan is the nearest thing to it but it needs injection of funding.  It needs investment.  It does not always have to be taxpayers' money but we have not yet managed the mechanisms to bring funding into the regions so they can become economic hubs.<\/p><p> I ask the committee to reflect on this.  Rural Ireland is often depicted as always whinging and looking for more taxpayers' money.  We see this in the portrayal of those of us who strongly fought against the carbon tax.  It is not that we are climate deniers.  We want a taxation system that does not bleed people more than they are already bled, that does not penalise people or stop them from taking up jobs, that allows people live in homes where fossil fuel is the only cheap fuel available, and does not allow them to die with the cold.  One of the things that would have happened had it been introduced is that older people who already do not use their energy enough would allow themselves to be even colder.  The Central Statistics Office shows that four people a year die with the cold in rural Ireland.<\/p><p> Can we look at the 2040 report and get serious about developing regions?  Can we get serious about attracting investment into the regions and about reforming our banking system?  I hope the rapporteur, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, will also consider these questions in his report.  Rural Ireland does not want to be dependent on anybody but it does need support it has not been getting.  I thank the committee sincerely and hope it takes our submission into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>As I am speaking on the regional enterprise side, I am conscious that some of my submission is very much from a national perspective.  I am going to skip over some parts.  Listening to my colleagues from Donegal and Galway, we might think there are differences but there are a lot of similarities as well.<\/p> <p>  The Mill Enterprise Hub is based in Drogheda, County Louth, the largest town in Ireland.  We are not considered a rural town and should not be but we have the same issues when it comes to living and working.  It is not sustainable for Drogheda to be a commuter town.  Towns right around the Dublin region are blighted by commuting.  It affects business and the quality of life in communities if people are coming home at half past seven, eight or nine o'clock at night and are stuck in traffic for an hour and a half each way every day.  Productivity levels go down.  I am going to focus on the commuter region even though Drogheda would be considered to be in the north-east region.<\/p> <p>  The Mill Enterprise Hub was set up five years ago.  We are a registered charity with a board of voluntary directors.  We had support from Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise office and Louth County Council.  We currently have over 30 companies based with us, with 83 employees.  The vast majority are micro-enterprises, one or two-person operations.  We also have emergent foreign direct investment companies.  According to the 2016 census, Drogheda has the largest population of any town in Ireland at just over 40,000.  Until the Mill Enterprise Hub was created, there was no viable enterprise centre in Drogheda.  We have a long history of industry but we wanted to upskill and target more digital-oriented companies.  We have been very successful in that.  Drogheda is about 50 km north of Dublin.  There is still a lot of confusion about where we are based as people tend to confuse Drogheda and Dundalk.  We feel we can emulate other cities and become a focal point for entrepreneurship in the region.  The three largest towns in Ireland, Dundalk, Navan and Drogheda, are all in close proximity to each other.  We all suffer from the same issues in respect of brain drain going in to Dublin every day.  It is critical that we counteract that and the Mill Enterprise Hub has done so with various programmes.<\/p> <p>  Over the last four or five years we have developed a range of programmes.  We have pushed for the M1 payments corridor, which was in the North East Action Plan for Jobs, which aims to develop a FinTech hub in the north east right across Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  We have had the Illuminate female entrepreneurship programme, in which we partnered with DCU's Ryan Academy.  We had a Drogheda young innovators programme and have worked on a start-up gathering with Enterprise Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  I also want to compliment some of the existing supports, hubs and start-ups.  There has been a very strong support for start-ups over the past few years.<\/p><p>We work closely with Dundalk IT, DCU, the Guinness Enterprise Centre and the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres.  There is a willingness to support each other.  Even within the small area of County Louth, under the Louth economic forum we have been strong on having the key enterprise centres working with each other to make sure we are not duplicating each other's activity.<\/p><p> I want to go through some of the challenges, quite a few of which deal with funding and are national challenges and not unique to Drogheda or the commuter towns of the north east.  We have more familiarity with Brexit issues due to our proximity to the Border.  Access to funding is still the major issue.  SMEs still have a great deal of difficulty with the banks.  We have come across a few companies, across all regions, that have had issues accessing funding under the employment incentive initiative, which is taking too long, with no guarantee at the end that funding will be approved.  On the start-up tax relief for entrepreneurs, SURE, again, companies have had issues in applying and due to the criteria being too restrictive.  In most cases, they have failed to secure the funding.  Cash flow assumptions are a massive issue that was dealt with at a previous committee session.  When it comes to cash flow and cash being king, SMEs still have a poor understanding of this and we would like more support for companies.<\/p><p> With regard to management skills in regard to recruiting and retaining employees, a point raised by colleagues from the Western Development Commission, one of the issues is that SMEs have to compete with larger companies, which is not easy.  Since we made our submission, there has been some change to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, in the recent budget but it is still an issue.  Visas have also been an issue, not just for FDI companies but also for SMEs.  Where a company is looking for visas for key overseas workers, it is taking too long to get them.<\/p><p> One of the questions was about poor communications with State agencies.  In our experience, and we work with Louth and Meath LEOs, which have representatives on our board, SMEs that engage with the enterprise support agencies get support, whether that is financial or advisory, but there is still a lack of knowledge on who to go to and when to go to them.  There is still a perception that companies will be sent to the wrong person or that the application processes are too long.  This leaves an opportunity for the community enterprise centres.  I mentioned the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres.  Many of the regions have strong community enterprise centres and there is an opportunity for them to take on more responsibility.  In the past, some community enterprise centres did not receive funding grants from Enterprise Ireland for key staff, which will be crucial going forward.<\/p><p> On commuter issues, I agree with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that the cities cannot take all the business and there is a need to prioritise regionalisation.  However, I urge the committee not to group all the east cost counties together.  The issues in Wicklow, Kildare and Louth are different from those in Dublin, although, much of the time, my colleagues in those counties see the focus moving to the west or the north.  If we want to develop sustainable communities, there has to be the right work-life balance.<\/p><p> The 2016 census showed that 200,000 commuters spend an hour or more commuting, an increase of 50,000 since 2011.  In Laytown-Bettystown, an area close to Drogheda, 28% of the workforce is commuting more than 60 minutes every day while it is 42% in Skerries, 28% in Naas, and 36% in Balbriggan.  This is clogging up the systems and is bad for the environment and productivity.  It is bad for Dublin-based businesses that people are stuck in traffic, as well as being demotivational for staff.  A more proactive approach to some of the commuter towns is needed.  While the unemployment rate may be lower than in some rural towns, which is great, in the long run this is detrimental to society and to developing proper communities.<\/p><p> As a solution, we suggest the reverse commute, which is probably not too dissimilar to the WDC's LookWest scheme.  This concerns the promotion of activities and programmes across the region, whether in Louth, Meath, Kildare or Wicklow.  There is probably a little bit of fear in SMEs and start-ups that they will not get the supports if they are outside the city.  That is the crucial part.<\/p><p> I have a couple of other issues.  The question of suitable office accommodation was raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Breannd&aacute;n Casey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Mr. Casey is out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#AA00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I will conclude.

The Minister sends her apologies but she could not attend.  The Department's supports for SMEs include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion, in addition to a range of impressive regulatory and oversight functions.  The Minister stated in her speech following the budget that her three priories are Brexit, regional growth and innovation.  We are supporting her goals and supporting SMEs.  I would like to draw the committee's attention to the Department's work with the OECD on a country review of SME policies and issues which will result in a roadmap for SME policy and a subsequent SME strategy for Ireland.  I would also ask the committee to note that this review has an entire section focused on reviewing the regional SME perspective.  We will be in a position to share this report with the committee before summer 2019.<\/p> <p>  The attractiveness of the business environment for SMEs is measured in the European Commission's small business fact sheet.  Since 2008, Ireland has made substantial progress in implementing the EU's Small Business Act policy roadmap.  Ireland performs above or well above in eight of the nine principal areas, including entrepreneurship, responsive administration, public procurement, access to finance, Single Market skills and innovation. <\/p> <p>  To focus more on the regional perspective, since 2015 the regional action plan initiative has been a central pillar of the Government's ambition to create 200,000 jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these being outside Dublin.  There has been an increase in employment of almost 12% from quarter 1 of 2015 to quarter 2 of 2018.  Three out of five of these jobs have been in regions outside Dublin.  The plans are monitored and driven in each region by implementation committees made up of representatives of the private sector, local authorities and enterprise agencies, and are chaired by a senior industry representative.  In April of this year, the Minister asked the regional action plan committees to lead a refresh and refocus of their action plans.  This refresh is about introducing a more focused strategic and collaborative approach.  The plans are intended to be completed by the end of 2018 and launched in early 2019. <\/p> <p>  Regional development and Brexit are significant components of Enterprise Ireland's SME supports.  The Department, through Enterprise Ireland, has rolled out a &euro;60 million regional enterprise development fund for new initiatives in the area of entrepreneurship, clustering, innovation hubs and other enterprise infrastructures to incubate and grow new start-ups and deliver new job creation projects.<\/p><p>To ensure a balanced regional spread, the Minister is committed to ensuring that each region will benefit by at least &euro;2 million from the overall fund.  Much like the committee's focus on bringing the spotlight on to SMEs, the Department has extensive engagement with SME stakeholders.  We have increased our outreach events, such as Getting Ireland Brexit Ready and Taking Care of Business, where SMEs can find the supports available and, more important, talk to the people who operate these supports.  We have a first-stop shop, an online tool at <i>www.supportingsmes.ie, <\/i>which is very useful.<br\/><br\/>The 31 LEOs provide a first point of contact to all enterprise related inquiries nationwide.  The LEOs strive to create and maintain client centred business networks and assist in developing progression paths to Enterprise Ireland's high-potential start-ups and established industry departments.  The LEOs also run the Irish Best Young Entrepreneur competition, which has a &euro;2 million investment fund and helps young entrepreneurs turn their business ideas into reality.  As was mentioned, finance is key for the development of all stages of business, be they start-ups, expanding or more mature SMEs.  The developer is leading in conjunction with the wider government in providing a variety of financial supports to suit the needs of these SMEs.  Some of these include the Brexit loan guarantee scheme, which was launched in March of this year with a fund of &euro;300 million and operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  By the end of September 2018, 200 firms had made successful applications.  Recently the Minister announced a longer term, &euro;300 million future growth loan scheme for loans of up to ten years.  <br\/><br\/>The credit guarantee scheme incurs additional lending to SMEs by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses and qualifying loans and so far the sanctions have been facilitated to &euro;93.9 million.  On a smaller scale there is Microfinance Ireland, which is set up to provide loans to microenterprises that have been refused bank finance and as at the end of quarter 3 2018, they have lent &euro;26.7 million to individuals, supporting more than 4,400 jobs.  The Enterprise Ireland seed and venture capital scheme established to increase the availability of risk capital for SMEs and, as of 2018, it committed &euro;510 million which has raised a total of &euro;1.19 billion in seed and venture capital funding.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has a strong and burgeoning SME base, which compares well with the international counterparts in terms of entrepreneurship and innovation.  Our business environment for them also compares favourably overall.  There is room for improvement and we are aware of the issues that are raised here today.  We welcome the committee shinning a light on indigenous SMEs. The Department will ensure that Ireland has the most competitive environment for starting, growing and scaling SMEs and I particularly thank Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for his invitation to come before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoghan Richardson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

The work of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has been exceptional and they must be commended for that work and tor the commitment particularly to Gaeltacht areas in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I am bothered by the skills shortage in the west.  One knows when one leaves the road in Mullingar or when one gets the motorway to Galway but if one heads towards Tuam, one will know one is in rural Ireland.  I drove right through it in 2016 to explore the area.  One can see the villages and the towns where there are people who are committed to long-term sustainable development and one can see the towns that are dying on their feet.<\/p> <p>  I am looking at how we are tending to pull skills into an area.  I single out Michael Hannon, as the registrar in GMIT for the development of Letterfrack industrial school.  I contrast that with the former catering school up in Killybegs, which has been transferred to Letterkenny.  When one pulls out an organisations, one pulls out the economic funding that goes into the area.<\/p> <p>  The original ETB legislation provided for the type of microfinance that we are talking about for start-ups.  However, as the legislation went through the system, the microfinance element was lost, which is a pity.  <\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses see a role for ETBs in developing skills-based courses which are bespoke for the area in which they are in?  Will they provide employment for the area?  As an example one could have pottery in one area, sculpture, or something else in another, do the witnesses see a benefit in that?<\/p> <p>  I am bothered by the provision of terrestrial-based broadband.  Most advanced countries and countries that are advancing are moving from terrestrial to Wi-Fi systems.  I am interested in views on that.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the Department, which has done an excellent job.  <\/p> <p>  My background is the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI.  When we started to develop technological universities, I was deeply concerned that we were throwing out the child with the bath water.  Regional technical colleges were originally put in place with a mandate to develop bespoke programmes to develop industry in their local area.  Do the witnesses have the same concerns that have as we move forward with the new higher technological universities?  Are we leaving a gap?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#BB00300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I apologise for being not present all day, but Senator Frances Black, myself and others attended the Ballymurphy massacre inquests.

I want to ask the officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation about worker co-operatives, an issue I have raised previously.  A significant proportion of GDP in many countries across Europe benefits from worker co-operatives.  It accounts for 13% of GDP in Sweden, 16% of GDP in Switzerland and a whopping 21% of GDP in Finland.  Scotland has seen significant progress in its co-operative sector since the Scottish co-operative development unit was established.  Our co-operative development unit was closed down in 2002.  Instead, we have zoned in and focused on foreign direct investment, but that is no good to the small businesses of the indigenous population.  We need such businesses to grow.  I keep pressing home the fact that there has been a significant shift in the public mindset.  People want to reduce their carbon footprint and buy Irish products from indigenous small businesses.  That is something we need to advertise constantly, especially because the younger generation is more socially aware and more environmentally aware.  It has to be tacked onto everything the Department does from a promotional perspective.  Will the officials from the Department comment on what Ireland can learn from Scotland's positive growth in the SME co-operative sector?  Do they believe we should re-establish our own co-operative development unit to support SMEs, especially in rural areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#CC00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Richardson to respond to Senator Devine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#CC00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I will pass it onto my colleague, Ms Gray.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoghan Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Perhaps I will answer the Senator's question about co-operatives by speaking about enterprise policy in general.

Our proposal makes it clear that there is room in Ireland for eight regional not-for-profit banks, each of which would be an independent entity.  I will set out the rules that would govern how they work.  Each of them would have to serve a population of at least 250,000.  In terms of governance, each of them would have an overview board to make sure they uphold the principles of public banking, including relationship-based banking that does not necessarily rely on computer algorithms to tell people whether they qualify for credit.  I am talking about the kind of relationship-building that used to happen in the ACC, which I mention to remind the committee that we had this kind of banking in this country in the past.  We should not be afraid of it.  We should not be afraid that it will step on mainstream banking.  It will complement the credit unions.  The whole purpose of the kind of banking we have proposed would be to lend money, mainly to the SME sector but also as mortgages.  These banks should not get involved in the kind of lending, including personal lending, which is done by the credit union movement at present.  When this kind of banking has established itself - we have said that each entity will begin to turn a profit after five years - it will begin to regenerate the money into the region.<\/p> <p>  If the members of the committee cannot go to Stuttgart or any other part of Germany, I ask them to examine how just one of the many hundreds of banks in Germany has developed the economy in its local region by working with all stakeholders rather than against them.  It is on record that when the world's banking system failed, the only type of banking that still survived was local public banking in Germany.  I think Angela Merkel had to go a long way to come around to the view that this is the right system.  She realised that the German small enterprise sector was actually very lucky to have had this kind of banking.  We would have been very lucky if we had had it.  The figures outlined by my colleague from the Western Development Commission would certainly look very different if we had this kind of economic hub.  I remind Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that we are talking about creating an economic hub in each of the regions as part of the Government's Project Ireland 2040 plan.  We are proposing a similar system to that which existed some years ago with the ACC and the ICC.  It is nothing to be afraid of.  It is a challenge.  If we do not live up to this challenge, we will be talking about the decay of Ireland in 20 years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#CC00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>Would Mr. &Oacute; h&Eacute;anaigh like a brief focal scoir?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#CC00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>Ceart go leor.

A question was asked about the skills that are absolutely vital to the companies we are developing and supporting in Gaeltacht areas.  We are trying to reverse the brain drain, to one extent.  We are also trying to get young people who are still at school to focus on the careers that are coming on line through the companies we are attracting and developing through natural resources and so on.<\/p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked what we are doing to attract people back.  We have a Gaeltacht diaspora project.  We have a very good quality of life in terms of culture, environment, safe areas and so on.  We now have the companies as well.  Randox in Dungloe is a very good example of that.  It could be situated anywhere on the island of Ireland or anywhere in Europe, but those involved decided to locate in Dungloe.  Highly qualified people with good skills and good experience are willing to return home to work in Randox.  I think it is a good model to show that rural areas can support these types of companies if we work to get them in, develop the infrastructure and attract people back.  We work in close co-operation with all the education and training boards, including Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, on the development of skills.  They are absolutely vital to us.  They have a key role in working with us to provide apprenticeships and skills to companies.<\/p> <p>  We also work very closely with the institutes of technology, which are good partners of ours as we aim to focus on certain sectors.  I mentioned earlier the example of P&aacute;irc na Mara, which is a key project for us as we seek to develop added value in the marine sector through research, innovation and incubation.  We are working on that project in partnership with Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, NUI Galway, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Foras na Mara, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Galway County Council and Teagasc.  All of the stakeholders in the project are bringing their skills and their ability to develop research and skills, etc., to the table.  The partnership is there.  It is absolutely vital that we are working together to provide these skills from the bottom up.  We are working in schools and colleges.  People who had to leave are being attracted back to the region to set up their own businesses or to work in companies.  I have to say on behalf of my close colleagues in Letterkenny Institute of Technology that the facility in Killybegs is very much alive and well.<\/p><p>A great effort has gone into keeping that open.  It is vitally important to that part of Donegal.

We have all the challenges that small to medium enterprises, SMEs, have with regard to the appropriate skills.  When a promoter comes to us we must ask if we can finance them and support them and we look at how that is driven.  People do not like to mention the State-aid rules but they dictate who we can and cannot help.  The Senator asked how many we refuse.  We do not maintain that data.  If we cannot help them we try to redirect them wherever we can, perhaps to a Leader programme, and if we cannot help them financially we see if we can help them with building capability and skills.  We do not like to look at the refusals; it is about the successes and the growth and where we can support them in soft advice and supports.<\/p> <p>  Infrastructure is a huge issue, be it broadband or the road to Carraroe or the road to Gweedore.  It is a major challenge because while we can build the advance factories or offices, how do we get the product and people in or out and how do we stop people leaving and not coming back?  That is a huge issue.  This is part of our work with secondary schools and is something that may have fallen back, but we are building it again.  In the 1980s and the 1990s we did a lot of work at secondary school level to show that these were the companies in the area and the skills that were needed.  Things went awry, but now we are back with Junior Achievement Ireland and looking at STEM to show the students how they can be on a global platform in some of the companies.  We tell the students that if they do their science or their ICT, they can work on the global stage and still live in their home region.  That is where rural Ireland has to turn it on its head, so we can have companies where people can work on the global stage while living in their local environment and raising their families there.  Sin rud at&aacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach do gach duine.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the matter of the technological universities.  Coming from a former regional technical college, RTC, myself I am aware that the RTC students hit the ground running.  Growth and restructuring of the apprenticeship system will bring huge value to companies so they can develop people in their skill sets, who will then stay or if they need to go then they can come back.  This will be a great bonus because people understand the apprenticeship system.  Rural people understand that process very well and have seen people doing extremely well.  We have the entrepreneurs, including a company in Donegal that has produced two leading apprenticeships in the motor industry, which came from that process.  We need to showcase those people to highlight the importance of that element of education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad N&iacute; Fh&aacute;tharta"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":733,"content":"<p>I will address the points in sequence across the board.  There is a challenge around skills but there are some solutions in the offing.  I was the inaugural chair of the regional skills forum in the west.  While all of the institutions are involved - such as the education and training boards, ETBs, the institutes of technology, IOTs, and the universities - one of the challenges is in communicating the importance of accreditation.  Until they understood fully what the issue is it is not clear to people why the accreditation from a university or an IOT or an ETB is important.  It is because it is effectively like a passport and a person can add to it as he or she goes along.  It is very important that this is communicated.<\/p> <p>  There is also a huge shift in non-traditional entry that allows people from other backgrounds to come in.  This is vitally important because it allows those people in who have fallen through the cracks the first time, or who do not get initial opportunities to come back.<\/p> <p>  On the broadband issue and the move from wireless to fibre broadband, some of the work done by the Western Development Commission has identified the importance of future proofing the use of fibre so that it is not only for the here and now, it must also give the long-term viability.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the data kept on those who are refused funding, there is certainly anecdotal data.  If one looks at it in terms of what lending devices or products we offer it is very important to learn where people are not getting the funding and then to examine why.  I would certainly be looking at putting in place a more structured way of capturing that data and seeing what we can learn from it.  I agree with Ms N&iacute; Fh&aacute;tharta that there are no failures in the sense that people are triaged and sent to other areas.  It is, however, important to examine some of the reasoning behind it and see what we can learn.<\/p> <p>  While not commenting specifically on the co-op development unit, one of the areas we are looking at is social enterprise.  This is important because it goes to the area of sustainability.  This is not just in the context of sustaining communities as communities, it is also about the broader issues around sustainability such as the green economy and climate change.  We are examining the social enterprise model in that context.<\/p> <p>  We would face the same issues around finance as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in that we have to operate under State-aid rules and we have to make sure we identify matching funding.  As I highlighted earlier, a key issue is the ability to attract other investors and private investment and I believe there is scope to look at solutions around the tax regime in that respect.<\/p> <p>  Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked about attracting people back to the west.  I deliberately wanted to finish on this issue because I believe it is absolutely crucial.  Work has been done by the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with an INDECON report on returning emigrants.  The report looked at what the issues are.  Information and insurance are key issues.  There are also practical concerns such as getting driving licences and so on.  More fundamentally, I believe that we need to change the narrative.  We need to move away from the region or the rural areas comparing themselves to other places and saying that we are not good enough.  That perspective does not hold true when we look at the fantastic physical beauty and the natural attributes of many of the regions we are discussing today.  There is also the fact that the very mobile workforce of returning emigrants bring fantastic skills with them.  Given the opportunities in remote working I agree with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that the diaspora is a key one-to-one unit in bringing people home.  There is an onus on all of us to work together to make sure that when people do come home it is less of a challenge than it currently is.  This should be addressed in the key areas but especially in the context of SMEs.  There is also a role for mentorship because when a person has an individual that he or she can work with and contact it allows that person to come back and hit the ground running.<\/p> <p>  Across the board it is very important that the conversation shifts to emphasise the positive.  This will be the key area.  We would be bringing people back home to a very attractive option in the context of work-life balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542119400,"counter":734,"content":"<p>Tendering is an issue that SMEs always struggle with.

The Government could look at that straight away.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate some of my colleagues' comments about the challenges.  I was at the launch last week in Dundalk of an apprenticeship scheme for software development and network management through Louth-Meath Education and Training Board and Fastrack to Information Technology, FIT.  This rapid response from industry and training, and the involvement by the institutions such as the Dundalk Institute of Technology and other institutes of technology is the model going forward.  We worked in the M1 Payments Corridor with Dundalk Institute of Technology on a new data analytics course.  Whether it is a large or a small company, that speed of response to training needs is required.  They cannot wait two, three or four years for a college to do it.  That has moved completely and we are seeing a much quicker turnaround now.  Reference was made to network clusters.  We are seeing that increased co-operation right across Ireland.

As I said earlier, this is the first time that SMEs have enjoyed such a public forum to air concerns in public and bring a cohesiveness to the debate.  There are many similarities between all of the witnesses have said.  We have heard some interesting ideas and thoughts that we would not have got in another forum or format.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations and comments.  We have had 15 organisations and businesses with about 20 different contributors, which is quite significant.<\/p> <p>  I thank my colleagues who came here and contributed, some of whom are not members of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  I thank Ms Doody and Ms Judge for their assistance.  They are the key to helping us to make these meetings happen.  I thank my personal assistant, C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh.  N&iacute;l fhios agam bhfuil s&eacute; ansin, C&aacute;it.  Go raibh maith agaibh.<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Majella Giblin from the National University of Ireland, Galway.  She is helping us to co-ordinate and put everything together in a structured and professional manner for what we believe will become a robust document.  Hopefully, it will help with the roadmap going forward.  I know that the witnesses and their colleagues will help implement all of that.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I thank the Cathaoirleach.  He has supported me in this endeavour from day one.  I publicly acknowledge and appreciate his support.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2018111300002#EE01500","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1542119400,"counter":751,"content":"<p> On behalf of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee I thank all of the witnesses who contributed to this session.  We have had a very informative and productive session.  We have all learned a lot from the insights and observations made by the witnesses.  Full account will be taken of today's discussions when the draft report is being prepared.  Copies of the final report will be sent to all contributors.<\/p> <p>  Before the public hearing on this topic concludes I wish to put on record my gratitude to all the members of the committee for their hard work over recent months.  In particular, I thank Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh who proposed this topic for discussion.  He has worked extremely hard in the background in preparation for these hearings, which I am sure everyone is well aware of.  I sincerely thank all  he people who made submissions to the committee and the witnesses who appeared before the committee today and at the two earlier sessions.  I wish to express my gratitude to the secretariat in the Seanad Office.
