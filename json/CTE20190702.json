I am here today to seek approval from the committee for the introduction of the Animal Health Levies (Pigs) Regulations 2019.  Under section 26(3) of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, draft regulations relating to animal health levies must be approved by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As such, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad have referred this matter to the committee for consideration.<\/p> <p>  The draft regulations for which I am seeking approval will introduce a levy at a rate of &euro;0.04 per porcine animal slaughtered or exported live from the State.  If approved, I will commence Part 5 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which relates to animal health levies.  The regulations are proposed to come into operation on 1 September 2019.<\/p> <p>  The Irish pig industry is the third most important agrifood sector, after the dairy and beef sectors.  It accounts for 8% of gross agricultural output.  There are approximately 440 commercial pig producers in Ireland producing about 4 million pigs annually.  The total number employed in the industry, including those employed on-farm as well as in associated sectors such as pig meat processing, feed manufacture, haulage and services, is estimated at 8,300.  In 2018, the value of pig and pigmeat exports amounted to approximately &euro;832 million.  After a number of difficult years, recent months have seen a welcome increase in prices to &euro;1.73 per kilo, up from a low of &euro;1.39 per kilo.  This is due to reduced European production and increased demand from China due to the outbreaks of African swine fever in that country.<\/p><p> As Ireland seeks to grow its pig and pigmeat exports, the imperative to maintain high standards of pig health also grows.  The moneys raised by the levy will directly fund Animal Health Ireland&rsquo;s activities in these areas.  To date, Animal Health Ireland, AHI, has made an important contribution to cattle farming in Ireland.  Government funding for AHI is provided on the basis of strict matching funding with private sector contributions.  In July 2017, I pledged &euro;125,000 per annum for three years in order to allow AHI commence work in the pig sector on the strict understanding that the pig industry would contribute a similar amount.  <\/p><p> A key recommendation of the 2016 report of the pig industry stakeholder group is the expansion of the AHI model to the pig sector.  The chair of the pig industry stakeholder group, Dr. Se&aacute;n Brady, strongly supported the initiative and in October 2017, agreement was reached for the imposition of a levy on pigs presented for slaughter or export in order to raise the industry&rsquo;s &euro;125,000 contribution.  In February 2019, the pigs committee of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, unanimously endorsed the introduction of such a levy.<\/p><p> Following agreement on funding, the AHI undertook a competitive recruitment process for a pig health expert.  An experienced person has been appointed pig health check programme manager.  They will take up their position with AHI at the beginning of September 2019.<\/p><p> I strongly believe the introduction of this levy is in the interests of the Irish pig sector.  Outbreaks of disease in Europe and further afield have highlighted the requirement for high standards of pig health.  It is a small but important contribution as we seek to exploit the opportunities arising out of the challenges facing pig health elsewhere around the globe.  I very much welcome the support of the industry and the IFA for this levy.  It is recognition of the need for a partnership approach between Government and the private sector towards matters of pig health, and the safeguarding of this important agrifood sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#C00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.

This measure has emanated from agreement between the farm organisations and the Department.  It appears approximately &euro;250,000 will be available and it will apply per animal, regardless of its value.  It will be strictly curtailed in that regard.  What will that money be spent on with respect to the identification of potential diseases that may well give rise to issues?  We must be mindful of swine fever and the development of various mutations of it at various levels in terms of bacterial and virus-induced diseases.  Pig farmers have had a difficult time during the past two or three years.  We talk about other sectors but pig farmers have been on the ground for the past two or three years and it is only in the past four or five months that things have started to pick up for them.  That is excellent.  There are three or four pig farmers based in Westmeath.  I would make the point that they maintain high standards of hygiene and animal welfare.  They are excellent in the work they put in and are a source of employment across County Westmeath and extending into Longford.  In this context, what work will Dr. Carla Gomes, as a pig health check programme manager, be doing?  With respect to the Government input and that of the pig producers and exporters, it is important they get a return from this money and that it is not a contribution on which there is no return.  Every penny should be earmarked for positivity in this respect.  One of the reasons we are discussing this sector is that China has suffered outbreaks of the African swine fever and that is partially why the prices in our pig industry have risen.  What can happen elsewhere, however, can happen here.  What protective measures to deal with the investigation of animal diseases, particularly those impacting on pig health, will be put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#D00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>A number of members are offering.

The levy will be 4 cent per animal.  I read in other documentation that a larger levy of 10 cent or 12 cent per animal was mentioned.  Was that a previous proposal?  With respect to the proposed levy before us, I assume the key objective in introducing it to ensure the sector continues to maintain a disease-free status.  Many of our competitors throughout the world have issues with disease and that inhibits the marketability of their product.  It is proposed this levy will be placed on each pig which will generate the contribution from the industry.  What will be the Government's contribution to the work involved and the research?  Is there scope to expand our pigmeat industry?  It has gone through a difficult time in recent years.  Many farmers involved in the industry thought hard about whether they should continue in the business but the sector is doing well at present.  We need to build a sustainable future for the pig industry.  While we recognise much of it is related to scale, we need to explore if there are opportunities for new entrants to that industry.  If it is run properly, I believe it has big potential for expansion, particularly given that many of our competitors have not been able to achieve the disease-free status we have in Ireland.  I welcome the concept of what we are trying to achieve.  The quantity of pigmeat we export is a reflection of the good work that has been done in the past, particularly by an industry that has been innovative and has been focused on delivering a high-quality product.  Anything that can drive that forward further is welcome and from that point of view I welcome the concept of what has been proposed.

It has been questioned whether the contribution would simply go into the AHI's overall budget and whether it could end up benefitting other sectors.

If I omit to deal with anything, I would be happy to come back to it.<\/p> <p>  This is trying to build on the template that Animal Health Ireland has brought to the livestock sector.  As alluded to by Deputy O'Keeffe, that has ten years under its belt.  It has been a significant success.  I appreciate that the Deputy zoned in on one of the sticks used to beat it.  Broadly speaking, it has been quite a successful endeavour in dealing with BVD, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR, Johne's disease and somatic cell count and has contributed to the public good for farmers.  For example, on BVD the private gain to farmers, if I may put it that way, has been estimated at approximately &euro;85 million.  As a model it works because it is owned by the industry stakeholders and facilitated by the Department, which puts some money into it.  We are trying to do the same thing for the pig sector.  I confess that this is somewhat later than I would have liked.  As I said in 2017 we hoped the matter would get under way, but we are getting there now anyway.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Pringle's question, it will deal with welfare issues.  It will deal with a host of other efficiencies, delivering on biosecurity issues through a targeted advisory service to be delivered through private veterinary practitioners to individual pig producers.  AHI has been successful in a tendering process under the rural development programme in that area.  That will be a critical part of it.  Hiring somebody to lead the effort in this area is really important.  I believe we have got a really credible internationally recognised expert in the field to drive this significant agenda.<\/p> <p>  We are developing a database to map the status of all producers' efficiencies, looking at things like lean management practices.  We are more familiar with that in its application to industry.  In the past 12 months I have seen its application in the dairy sector.  We are working on driving that efficiency programme into the pig sector.<\/p> <p>  Welfare will form a critical part of it.  It is an holistic embrace of the industry, driven as much by the industry itself as by the expertise that AHI or the new programme manager brings to it.<\/p> <p>  Somebody asked about what we are doing about African swine fever on which much remains to be done.  While I am somewhat slow to say we are prospering on others' misfortune, it is critical that we do everything we can to protect our own biosecurity here.  We are fortunate that, as an island nation, it is somewhat easier than it is elsewhere.  However, there is no room for complacency owing to the amount of traffic into and out of the country.<\/p> <p>  A disease information leaflet went out with the annual pig census letter to all registered pig farmers last autumn.  We are preparing some messaging on food waste, which is a critical issue particularly for smaller farmers.  A biosecurity leaflet for non-intensive pig farmers was distributed at the ploughing championship last year.  A biosecurity leaflet for hunters travelling to African swine fever areas was sent to the National Association of Regional Game Councils in April.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport sent a leaflet to international hauliers on our behalf.  Members will be familiar with a new poster campaign at point of embarkation from the State, whether airports or ports.  We are working with individual pig farmers to address their own biosecurity issues.<\/p> <p>  Considerable effort is going into African swine fever issues to create awareness not just within the industry, but among members of the public because an accidental or inappropriate disposal of salami, ham sandwiches etc. could expose the entire sector here to African swine fever.  Some of the recovery in the market is as a consequence of problems other countries are experiencing in this area and we want to ensure we have no own goals in that respect.  It is a complex multifaceted approach to try to create awareness of the appropriate biosecurity measures, not just at the industry level but among the broader public travelling abroad.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Paul Daly, it is 4 cent per animal slaughtered or exported.  The collection will be primarily through the slaughtering plants.  There is agreement between the producers and processors on this issue.  It will raise approximately &euro;125,000 for AHI and we will match that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of market potential, we obviously see significant market potential in China, which is our second biggest market after the United Kingdom.  We also see opportunities for increasing exports arising from EU-Mexico and EU-Thailand trade deals.  We have agreed veterinary health certificates for pigmeat with Ukraine recently.  All those help to contribute to a positive market situation, which has seen the price rise from about &euro;1.39 to about &euro;1.70 in recent months.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill is correct that it is a difficult sector and is a capital-intensive sector.  I believe Senator Mulherin asked about the possibility of new entrants but it is a capital-intensive sector to enter.  It goes through cycles of challenge in terms of returns.  It is not an industry for the faint-hearted in that sense.  People need to be able to ride out the downturns while waiting for the upswing.  The upswing is significant now and there is a level of confidence about the sustainability of that in the medium term for reasons I have just alluded to.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that Deputy O'Keeffe would know more about this than any of us in the room.  While there is potential for new entrants the numbers have been reducing steadily.  There are about 440 commercial pig farmers in the country, but 19% of them produce more than 40% of the total output.  Some of them are very big by any international standards.  As I said, it is a very capital-intensive industry to get into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#E00400","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>What about the issue of the money being ring-fenced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#F00100","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Within Animal Health Ireland, the industry is its own policeman in that sense.

Our most recent engagement with the committee was in January, when it was updated on how the negotiation process had evolved up to that point, the key issues of importance for Ireland, indicative timings regarding the development of the proposals and where matters stood as regards the funding of the next CAP.  Since then, negotiations have progressed under the Romanian Presidency.  Only yesterday, the incoming Finnish Presidency set out its priorities for the next six months.  My intention today is to update the committee on the negotiation process over the past six months, the developments at Council and European Parliament level, the indicative timing for agreement on the legislative proposals, the Department&rsquo;s consideration of the proposals and the next steps, both at EU and national levels.  Since the committee was last updated, the Department has refined some of its thinking in respect of the legislative proposals.  In that context, I will also provide a brief update on the key issues from Ireland's perspective.<\/p> <p>  The CAP legislative proposals have been discussed at length during the Romanian Presidency, with a total of 22 separate working group meetings taking place, that is, 16 meetings of the working party on horizontal agricultural questions, which dealt with the CAP strategic plan regulation, and six working party on financial agricultural questions, AgriFin, meetings examining the financial management and monitoring elements of the new CAP.  Specific elements of the CAP post-2020 proposals, guided by Presidency policy papers, were also discussed at 14 Special Committee of Agriculture meetings.  EU Agriculture Ministers also discussed the proposals at each of their Council meetings during the Romanian Presidency. <\/p> <p>  The Romanian Presidency adopted a thematic approach to the negotiations, discussing a different theme each month.  The themes focused on the new delivery model and the performance framework, indicators, rural development, greening and interventions.  The Presidency&rsquo;s ambition was to achieve a partial general approach on the proposals at its last Agriculture and Fisheries, Agri-Fish, Council, in June.  As part of that ambition, it presented a ten-step roadmap at the Council meeting in May.  This included holding technical bilateral meetings with member states in a bid to identify their key issues, as well as areas of mutual understanding.  Ireland presented its key issues to the Romanian Presidency at its technical bilateral meeting, and I will come to these issues later.  Despite the Presidency&rsquo;s best efforts to achieve a partial general approach, it was not possible to do so.  The complexity of the proposals and the number of outstanding issues that were still to be agreed upon ultimately led our colleagues to downgrade their expectations.  Instead, they presented a progress report and state of play on each of the three regulations at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 June.<\/p> <p>  On the CAP strategic plan regulation, the Romanian Presidency presented several versions of revised drafting suggestions.  The first two versions focused on some politically sensitive aspects, including definitions for permanent pasture, young farmer and genuine farmer, capping of direct payments, complementary redistributive income support for sustainability, natural or other area-specific constraints, establishment of the performance framework, and annual performance reports.  The second revision of drafting suggestions involved a comprehensive redraft of the entire proposal.<\/p> <p>  In the case of the horizontal regulation, the Presidency presented a consolidated text and considered that the current redrafted text was mainly fit for purpose.  The redrafted text tries to address member states&rsquo; concerns and also provides clarification on the integrated administration and control system, conditionality and the control and penalty system.  However, concerns remain among member states regarding the new delivery model and the alignment of the horizontal regulation with the CAP strategic plan regulation.<\/p> <p>  The Romanian Presidency also presented revised drafting suggestions for the amending common market organisation, CMO, regulation in March.  The majority of the amendments related to the wine sector, with additional amendments made for hemp imports, marketing rules for wine to the olive oil sector and prolonging national aids in Finland until 2027.  All provisions with budgetary implications or of a horizontal nature were set aside pending further progress on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and currently appear in square brackets.<\/p> <p>  At the Presidency&rsquo;s last Agri-Fish Council of Ministers meeting in June, member states considered its progress report.  While member states acknowledged the work done and the progress made, all were agreed that there were a number of issues still to be resolved before agreement could be achieved.  This also included the need to have further progress in the MFF negotiations.<\/p> <p>  The negotiation process will continue under the Finnish Presidency.  The Finns have outlined their objectives for the CAP post-2020 negotiations, namely, to advance the negotiations as far as possible - taking into account the uncertainties linked to this process, including agreement on the MFF budgetary proposals, Brexit and the European Parliament&rsquo;s consideration of the proposals - and to at least produce an updated set of draft legal texts by the end of their Presidency, and, if possible, to reach a Council general approach.  This last objective is likely to be very much dependent on the outcome of the MFF negotiation process.<\/p> <p>  In parallel to the Council's deliberations, the European Parliament has also been considering the CAP legislative proposals.  Both the EU Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, COMAGRI, and the Committee on Environment, Public health and Food Safety, a committee of the European Parliament, have considered the proposals in detail.  The ENVI committee adopted its position on the CAP strategic plan regulation on 14 February 2019.  COMAGRI voted on the three legislative proposals in April - on the CMO regulation on 1 April, the CAP strategic plan regulation on 3 April, and the horizontal regulation on 8 April.  All votes were passed.  However, they are not legally binding at this time.  As there was no plenary discussion before Parliament rose for the European elections in May, the Parliament could not formally adopt its position.<\/p> <p>  Department officials have also been considering the CAP legislative proposals in detail since their launch last year.  This involves regular and ongoing consultation with relevant farm bodies and stakeholders.  Following on from the CAP consultative conference in July of last year, the Minister, Deputy Creed, has recently established a national CAP consultative committee to facilitate ongoing consultation with key stakeholders regarding the reform of the CAP post-2020.<\/p> <p>  I would now like to address some of the key points of concern for Ireland that have arisen during the negotiations to date.  Ireland has outlined its concerns on a regular basis during the negotiation process, and reiterated them at the technical meeting with the Romanian Presidency in May.  It will come as no surprise to hear that the majority of our concerns relate to the CAP strategic plan regulation, and I will come to these shortly.  I would first like to address our concerns with the amending CMO regulation and the horizontal regulation.  First, the majority of changes to the amending CMO regulation relate specifically to the wine sector, and we do not have a difficulty with these.  More generally, however, we consider that it is essential to maintain the existing market support measures within the CMO regulation in order to ensure continued market stability and to protect producers.  We continue to see the traditional market support mechanisms such as intervention and aids to private storage as an important safety net, in addition to the ability, as at present, to respond to exceptional market disturbances.  In the case of the horizontal regulation, there are strong linkages between this regulation and the CAP strategic plan regulation, in particular with regard to the performance framework.  We think that joint consideration of both regulations is therefore required in order to provide clarity on a number of areas, including the level required for performance reporting, the level of detail required explaining variations on annual performance reporting, and the role of the certifying body at a practical level.<\/p> <p>  On the integrated administration and control system, we consider there is a need to have a transitional period for the area monitoring system in order to facilitate the development and implementation of the system.  We also consider there should be a uniform approach across member states in identifying non-compliances at farm level and implementing associated penalties so as to ensure a level playing field.<\/p> <p>  For the CAP strategic plan, we continue to have serious concerns regarding the implementation of the new delivery model and consider that significant further work is required on this at a technical level.  The changes to the direct payments system are also of concern to Ireland.  The Minister has already said that we can support the mandatory capping of direct payments and mandatory eco-schemes.  However, we consider that capping should not apply to eco-schemes or the direct payments top-up to young farmers above the capping limit.  With regard to the mandatory requirement for member states to deduct labour costs before capping, we consider this to be an unnecessary administrative burden and that it should be voluntary.  As regards coupled support, Ireland has no difficulty with the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to reduce this from an envelope of 13% plus 2%, to 10% plus 2%.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the planned crisis reserve, which proposes that the financial discipline in 2020 be the primary source of funding for the reserve, we consider that the use of all other funds, including assigned revenue, should be drawn on first for setting up the reserve in 2021.   In the case of risk management tools, Ireland&rsquo;s preference is for this to be a voluntary option for member states.<\/p> <p>  On environmental conditionality, we have already said that we are supportive of the increased environmental ambition in the next CAP.  We consider there should be a common set of standards for member states to which to adhere.  However, implementation of environmental measures may require different practical actions to be undertaken in each member state, and these should be established on foot of an evidence-based assessment of the conditions in each member state.  The requirement of 15% expenditure for environmental actions to be undertaken by producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector is challenging for Ireland as it presents technical difficulties for us.   We would like to maintain the current 10% level in the next CAP.<\/p> <p>  We have highlighted our concerns to the Romanian Presidency in the area of definitions, in particular for the young farmer, genuine farmer and eligible area.  The genuine farmer has again proved problematic to reach agreement on and we consider the Commission&rsquo;s definition to be unworkable for us.<\/p><p>Ireland has supported the Presidency&rsquo;s proposal that this be voluntary for member states.<\/p><p> For the young farmer, we have supported the increased level of ambition by the Commission to attract young farmers into farming and to encourage generational renewal.  We see education as an essential requirement for young farmers, but would like to see additional flexibility being provided to member states to set down further criteria as required.  With regard to the 2% financial target to support young farmers, we are strongly of the view that we should be allowed to count our top-up investment grant support to young farmers as part of this 2%.<\/p><p> In a broader context, and following my earlier references to the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, negotiations, the committee will be aware of the proposed 5% cut to the CAP budget after 2020.  The proposed cut is unacceptable for Ireland.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has been working hard with his EU ministerial colleagues in garnering support for maintaining the CAP budget at current levels for the EU 27 in the next period.  Agreement on the MFF post-2020 proposals is a necessary component towards achieving agreement on the CAP post-2020 proposals.  The MFF post-2020 negotiation process was recently discussed at the European Council, where the Romanian Presidency presented a progress report on the work carried out to date.  Negotiations will continue under the Finnish Presidency and the Finns hope to present a first set of figures for member states to consider in October.<\/p><p> Ultimately, agreement on the MFF proposals is a matter for EU finance ministers and Heads of State and Government.  We are aware that there are diverging views among member states at this level as to the level of funding that should be attributed to the CAP in the next programming period.  This is a challenge for Ireland that is compounded further by Brexit issues.  The Commission&rsquo;s objective was to have the proposals adopted by the co-legislators in spring 2019, prior to European Parliament elections in May.  However, this was not possible to achieve.  Trilogue discussions between the Council, Parliament and the Commission will not commence until the Council position and Parliament position have been agreed.<\/p><p> The European Parliament&rsquo;s COMAGRI, Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, has voted on the three CAP legislative proposals.  However, as there was no plenary before the European Parliament rose for the May elections, the Parliament could not formally adopt its position.  The Romanian Presidency had been hoping to achieve a partial general approach on the CAP proposals by the end of its EU Presidency.  However it downgraded its expectations ahead of the June Council.  Instead, it presented a progress report on the work done over the past six months at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 18 June in Luxembourg.  Discussions will continue under the Finnish Presidency.<\/p><p> Until the position of the newly elected Parliament is known, it is difficult to have a clear timetable for the CAP reform process.  Agreement of the MFF post-2020 proposals, which sets out the EU budgetary allocations for the period from 2021 to 2027, is not expected to be achieved until autumn 2019.  The Finnish Presidency indicated its ambition to achieve that in the outline of its working programme yesterday.  This adds another layer of complexity to reaching agreement on the CAP post-2020 proposals.<\/p><p> We still have some way to go before agreement on the proposals can be achieved.  We need to have some idea as to what the final shape of the proposals will be before we can commit ourselves to undertaking the SWOT - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats - analysis and needs assessment required before developing our strategic plan.  The Department is continuing to engage, however, with stakeholders through the CAP consultative committee, as well as through regular meetings with key stakeholders.  This is a key priority for the Department and will continue to be so until agreement has been reached on the proposals.<\/p><p> I look forward to addressing any questions the members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Savage for his detailed update.

As I mentioned earlier, the Commission&rsquo;s original attention was, essentially, to have the positions of the Parliament and Council agreed before the middle of this year and have trilogues commenced in order that we would be able to launch CAP strategic plans by 1 January next year.  Then the Commission would have assessed those in time for September of next year in order that the programme could start in January 2021.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, that timetable has slipped somewhat in terms of progress in the negotiations to date.  There is still much work to do over the next six months.  The doubt over the timing on the MFF is causing a further unpredictability, as well as the Parliament&rsquo;s position being unclear.  The Parliament indicated today that several options were being considered.  It could refer its position back to COMAGRI and start from scratch.  It could give COMAGRI the option to add further amendments to the position which the Parliament established several months ago.  Alternatively, it could go back to the start.<\/p> <p>  With all of those uncertainties in the pot, it looks like a challenge to stick to the original timetable.  There has not been any formal addressing of the issue from the point of view of the Commission in terms of any extension or otherwise.  All we can do ourselves is engage in the process as best we can, move it on as quickly as we can and respond to developments as they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Savage for his presentation.  I do not mean this as an insult or a criticism but there were not too many answers in it.  I agree with the Chairman that I cannot see how we can get to the envisaged finish point in the timetable.  Until Brexit is finalised, there will be little movement in the CAP negotiations.  The first point is to get agreement on the budget.  I cannot see how a budget can be agreed while Brexit is still up in the air.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Savage stated that we should be allowed to count our top-up investment grant support to young farmers as part of this 2% financial target.  In the present seven-year CAP budget, how will this break down?  Were the TAMS, targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, included in the young farmer allocation?  If they were, what was the percentage breakdown between the top-up on the single farm payment and TAMS?  If Mr. Savage does not have figures for this, will he pass them on to me?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Savage referred to an extension of national aid to Finland.  Will he expand on this exemption and what relief it is getting in that regard?  On several occasions before, I have raised market support schemes and aids to private storage, APS, and how disappointed I was to see the rules on intervention change in the middle of a CAP agreement.  We had a fixed purchasing price for a certain tonnage of skimmed milk powder but it was suspended for 2018 and 2019.  In 2019, the market recovered and the price of skimmed milk powder went back above intervention prices, although farmers paid very much in 2018 when the price was significantly under the intervention price.  Would the fact the market returned to equilibrium with no intervention influence the Commission&rsquo;s thinking in future interventions?  I have never seen an agreement suspended midstream.  It was a serious departure that set a precedent which I would not like to see occur again.  Private storage is important to seasonal producers on the dairy side and APS is essential.<\/p> <p>  It is a detailed presentation but it does not give any definite answers as regards young farmers or the definition of genuine farmers.  I am not criticising that as I accept where the negotiations are at and no definite decisions have been taken.<\/p> <p>  It might be an unfair question for a civil servant, but does Mr. Savage believe the new European Parliament will have a greater or lesser green influence than the outgoing Parliament?  Will the new Parliament try to have a larger proportion of the CAP budget devoted to greening measures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#M00400","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The fact the timetable for negotiations has not been achieved with the budget and Brexit emphasises the point I made earlier that there is significant uncertainty around all of these matters.

We are in a unique situation nowadays in comparison with what would have been the case in the past when we were negotiating reform packages.  <\/p><p> On the 2% for young farmers and the inclusion of the grant support, the young farmers scheme comprises 2% of the basic payment ceiling.  Currently, it does not include TAMS payments.  TAMS payments are not used to calculate that 2% overall.  It is effectively driven by the demand for young farmer top-ups.  In regard to the breakdown of the figures, I will follow up with the committee in that regard because I do not have them to hand.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I would not expect Mr. Savage to have them to hand.

From our perspective, to ensure that we can meet the 2% we need to acknowledge the grant supports that are available under Pillar 2 and take account of all payments to young farmers rather than only top-up payments under Pillar 1.<\/p> <p>  On national aids to Finland, I do not have the details on that to hand so, again, I will follow up with the committee on the issue.  It is essentially a CMO issue.  It could be wine or sectoral grant aid.  I will come back to the committee on it.  <\/p> <p>  On the market supports, aid to private storage, APS, intervention, Deputy Cahill mentioned the change in regard to the skimmed milk powder, SMP, price when the price was suspended for 2018-2019 and he asked whether the fact that the market recovered might influence the Commission's thinking in terms of the way forward and the market supports in the new programme.  I do not think that is evident at this stage.  In regard to the proposals that we have, it is clear that the intention is to continue the suite of measures that are in place in terms of market supports.  The Commission has been clear in setting that out, which we welcome.  There are not a lot of issues in the single common organisation of the markets, CMO, regulation for Ireland.  There are not many changes that directly affect us.  Our primary concern in the context of the CMO regulation is to ensure that the range of measures currently in place, including APS intervention, the provision to intervene in exceptional circumstances, continue into the future.  This is the intention under the Commission's proposals.  If it was influencing the Commission, we would have evidence of that by now.  It is not something that we have seen as part of the negotiation process thus far.  I would be confident that the range of measures as outlined in the proposal will be maintained.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also mentioned young farmers and genuine farmers.  Again, we are still dealing with those issues in the context of the negotiations as they are ongoing.  On young farmers, there have been various proposals from member states on this issue over the past while.  Our concern from an Irish perspective is that we have as much flexibility as possible in the definition of young farmer, not just in regard to, for instance, education requirements, as is provided for in the regulation, but also in terms of the flexibility to apply other conditions.  In other words, whatever we feel is appropriate in terms of training or otherwise for young farmers.  This is an issue that is still in discussion in the context of the negotiations.  We are not at the end of that as yet but we have made clear our view on it.  <\/p> <p>  On genuine farmers, the Deputy may be aware that the proposed definition of genuine farmer does not work for us.  There is also an issue in terms of, for instance, the deduction of labour costs and other aspects of it which do make sense from our point of view.  We do not believe that the current definition is workable.  From our perspective, we would like to have it as an optional provision for member states.  This would allow member states to come up with a definition which would be based on objective criteria from a member state point of view.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's final comment in regard to the European Parliament and having a greater or lesser greening influence, it is not really a matter for me to comment on.  On the basis of the results of the elections, there is certainly a stronger green presence in the Parliament than has been the case previously.  I think it is inevitable that this will influence the direction the Parliament takes into the future, but to what extent, we will have to wait and see.  It is still early days.  The new Parliament convened this morning.  We will have to wait and see what way the structure and the machinery of the new Parliament is put in place and what the green component of that will be.  Undoubtedly, more generally, the green developments over the past while serve to heighten the fact that even within the CAP, increasing pressure and responsibility are being pushed on member states to achieve a higher level of climate ambition.  This will find traction in a Parliament which has a greater green presence in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>It might help in defending the CAP budget if they are genuine in what they are trying to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#N00400","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy referring to the green representatives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Yes.

Every time there is a CAP review, the talk is of a more straightforward and simpler CAP.  In his opening statement, Mr. Savage mentioned changes to direct payments and new delivery models.  How will that circle be squared to make CAP simpler and less bureaucratic for the individual on the ground who was hoping for this to happen?<\/p> <p>  On the reserve fund, is it being replaced with a new risk management tool?

We take it as a given that we are endeavouring to be as simple as possible in the way that the CAP is structured.  We have said in the past at member state level that it would be simpler for us to implement the CAP if we were given more subsidiarity and more responsibility for carrying out and controlling the measures.  One could say that the Commission has called our bluff on that in setting out a new approach under the CAP.  It is giving member states more responsibility in terms of carrying out controls and we have to do it within the broader framework that has been created at European level.  Notwithstanding that, there are still a number of elements of the proposals that will not reduce but in many ways intensify the complexity of the measures that we will have to put in place and the systems we will have to put in place to monitor that.  I will return to this in a moment.<\/p> <p>  In an overall sense, the Commission has called for, and member states have repeated, the need for simplification in the CAP.  This should underpin all of the discussions we undertake in regard to any aspect of the CAP.  As far as the new delivery model is concerned, the question is how do we make it simpler.  From our point of view, the new delivery model is the key to our approach to the overall CAP negotiations.  We are moving from a compliance model to a performance model where we are required to come up to a certain standard in terms of how we implement the CAP and then we have to demonstrate that.  We say that member states have to be allowed to do that in a simple way and not an overly complex way.<\/p><p>Part of the Department's issue about the proposed new delivery model is that there are a number of very complicated elements to it which we feel are almost unworkable.  For instance, there is a question as to how we establish unit amounts for non-area or non-animal based interventions to measure the impact of different actions in the delivery model.  It is easy to establish unit amounts in the case of, say, direct payments, or in cases where one is talking about the number of payees, or the area to which one is applying it but, in the case of other schemes which are demand-led, for instance those under Pillar 2, it is not always easy to set out those amounts in advance because one does not know what level of response one will get, or how much money one might spend on different measures.  To ask people to come up with annual unit amounts, monitor that and potentially pay penalties for deviations beyond it, seems overly complex.  We must come up with a solution as to how we even set indicative targets for annual unit amounts for non-area schemes and maybe allow us, for instance, to notify those to the Commission outside the strategic planning and amendment processes in a way to allow us to identify those amounts after we have got the response to the programme from people who are applying for it.  In other words, when the scheme has been established, we will then be in a position to set those figures.<\/p><p> There are a number of other issues around the delivery model including, for example, reporting requirements.  There is a raft of result indicators and other indicators with which member states must comply.  We are asking for that to be simplified.  The Commission proposal talks about result indicators and annual milestones being reported on across the board.  We are saying that, in the case of, say, result indicators that might apply to multiple interventions, we might only have to report on one key result indicator and not across the full range that apply in a particular scheme.<\/p><p> There are also issues regarding the minimisation of the reporting obligations by the 15 February deadline every year.  From our point of view, there is potential for information technology to be used to a greater extent, for instance in supporting inspection activity on the ground.  That is not particularly well facilitated in the proposals at the moment.  <\/p><p> There is also a need for much more targeted measures.  If the complexity of the model being used to oversee things can be reduced, then those measures can be targeted much more effectively.<\/p><p> From our point of view, the new delivery model does not satisfy the simplification criterion in many ways and that is something on which we have been working.  To be honest, part of the problem with not achieving a partial general approach during the Romanian Presidency at the end of June was this very problem about the new delivery model and the performance framework.  Many member states, including Ireland, had serious questions about that, felt the Presidency was moving too fast, and it still needs much technical discussion.  We are hopeful we can make more progress on that over the next number of months under the Finnish Presidency.<\/p><p> On the issue of the crisis reserve, the Commission is proposing that the funds that would be used to create the crisis reserve would be from the financial discipline that would be applied in 2020, carrying into 2021.  We are saying that we should have recourse to other unspent funds which would allow us to avoid taking that financial discipline from farmers in 2020 and carrying it forward into 2021.  We again think it would be fairer and simpler to continue on with that and try to establish the reserve from other sources.  All other sources should be used before we revert to the financial discipline that has been there in that past.  We should then look at our options beyond that.<\/p><p> There was mention of replacing the crisis reserve with a new risk management tool but it is not so much about that.  The proposal, as it stands, talks about a mandatory requirement for risk management tools on the part of member states.  We would prefer risk management tools to be voluntary and we have repeated that in discussions to date.  We still maintain that position.  Reference was made to insurance and other potential options.  That would allow us to assess what might be feasible at a member state level but it would be underpinned by a voluntary provision in the regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I apologise to the representatives from the Department for the fact that I have been in and out of the meeting because of how the voting fell in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  I thank our guests for their presentation although I did not quite catch it all because I was in and out.  Could I ask the Department to come back and talk about the budget, where it is and where our guests feel the budget is going to sit?  The presentation mentioned that there was originally a proposed cut to the CAP.  Our guests might elaborate on where they think that actual budget is going to fit in.

Will there now be renegotiations on the beef element of the CAP?  Beef was a major part of the deal announced at the weekend.  Will issues regarding beef be looked at again in the CAP to take into consideration the political agreement on Mercosur that happened over the weekend?

I mentioned earlier that the proposal at the moment is for an overall 5% cut in the CAP budget.  That affects both direct payments and rural development.  We have said that is not acceptable, particularly given, as I mentioned earlier, that we are in the midst of CAP reform which calls for greater climate ambition to be achieved and for greater ambition on the parts of farmers and others to achieve those higher environmental targets.  If we are asking people to do more, we should have a CAP budget commensurate with that.<\/p> <p>  The Department and Minister have been active in getting member state support for the maintenance of the CAP budget as it stands at the moment.  We have had initiatives with other member states.  For instance, last year we co-signed an initiative in Madrid with Spain and other member states to call again for the maintenance of the CAP budget at its current level.  That had built to include the support of 20 member states.  We have been actively lobbying on that issue and trying to ensure we try to restore the budget to its current level beyond the time period proposed.  <\/p> <p>  We will have to wait and see what happens with negotiations over the next few months and how that fits with the overall CAP process.  The Senator might have seen that, as part of the discussion in June leading up to the adoption of the Presidency's progress report, a number of member states were saying it was too early to go for the partial general approach, which the Presidency was hoping for and much of the argument on that was to do with the fact that we need more clarity on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the budget before we can finalise what we will do on the CAP.    Consequently, the timing of the negotiations over the next few months will be important because it will affect the timing of the development of the CAP reform proposals.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of a hard Brexit, the proposals as they stand simply do not take account of Brexit when it comes to funding.  If the UK leaves and takes its net contribution with it, that will create an issue and a hole in the budget for the period beyond that.  The question then will be how, and to what extent, we fill that hole.  Will it be from member state contributions or cuts from expenditure in other areas?  That question will be raised in the context of how the Commission and member states will deal with that.  The impact of a hard Brexit would mean, essentially, that this hole would emerge much more quickly than would be the case if there was an orderly Brexit over a period of time.  We must wait and see how that process unfolds.<\/p><p>I am not sure what the Senator means by the beef element of the CAP after Mercosur when he speaks about renegotiating it.  I would be inclined to focus on the market support measures in the CAP under the Common Market organisation regulation.  A suite of measures is available which, as the Senator knows, has recently been deployed in response to the uncertainty created by Brexit and the recent drop in beef prices.  Part of the motivation for us to continue that suite of measures under the Common Market organisation, CMO, is to give us the wherewithal to respond to shocks to the system, no matter where they might come from.  We can deploy aids to private storage, intervention or exceptional aid in circumstances where that is necessary, if there is a particular market disturbance.  The package of market support measures within the CMO is something that we would be happy to have continued in order to have a mechanism to provide support where necessary.<\/p><p> More generally, the Mercosur agreement is not a good outcome for beef farmers here, as the Minister said.  We will have to assess where we go from here.  It is happening despite the efforts we have made over many years, which have been effective to some degree in trying to mitigate the impact of a potential Mercosur deal on the beef sector.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the definitions of young farmer, genuine farmer and land eligibility.  It is hard to say how far we are from finalising it.  The definition of young farmers is still under discussion.  The process still has some way to go over the next months.  Different member states disagree on what they would like to have in the definition.  Many member states would be happy with simply having the reference to education requirements that need to be satisfied by young farmers.  We would be happy to see more flexibility in order that we potentially could add more criteria if we wish, to try to improve the quality and to get a better return on the kinds of qualified people who are coming into farming.  There is still a little to be done on that definition.  It is the same for the definition of a genuine farmer.  We have made clear our unhappiness about the proposal as it currently stands.  We have called for that to be voluntary for member states because we do not think that the current definition is workable.  We would like it to be voluntary so that it would be up to us to come up with objective criteria to define a genuine farmer.  There is a significant degree of disagreement about where that should go.  We will have to see how the technical discussions evolve.<\/p><p> There is a broader issue relating to land eligibility, which is still outstanding in negotiations.  Some technical discussion is still required.  It is difficult to be certain about the timing of the resolution of the definitions of land eligibility, young farmers or genuine farmers.  We will have to continue to input to the process and hope that we can get to a conclusion on those quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I have few questions, as I missed the presentation.

Is it here or in Brussels that it will be handled?  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's definition of a young farmer is 40 years of age or under, whereas for Revenue it is 35 years when transferring land.  Could that be tied up and could the organisations work together?  The witnesses might be able to inform us about the incentive for the older farmer to get a retirement scheme such as existed previously.  Is there something on the horizon in this regard?  There is a category in Ireland called the forgotten farmer.  Those are people who missed out on payments but who were under 40.  They were not involved in the reference years or they had low numbers in the reference years.  My understanding is that the Department and Brussels have cleared the hurdles for those individuals to be included.  Are they being included now?  Will farmers who started farming over the past five to ten years and who would not have received any payments be included in it?  Are there initiatives for the family farm or will it be up to the member state to decide if it will front-load to protect the family farm?<\/p> <p>  Will there be a proper environmental scheme?  The witnesses have pointed out that Mercosur is a bad deal for Irish beef farmers.  Will supports come in for suckler cows?  Is there any environmental proposal in Europe for those farmers farming in designated areas who are not able to farm in the same way as other, undesignated areas with fewer restraints?  Is there a separate package, although not one outside the CAP, for the environment that will help those farmers?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the definition of a farmer.  Is that defined under the CAP or do world trade agreements decide this?  Will we still have the situation where people might sell the grass off land and have a good single farm payment?  Will there be a stocking rate or such that a farm will have to have for the whole year, rather than having donkeys for five to seven months and still being covered?  I acknowledge that is for schemes such as areas of natural constraint, ANC.  My understanding is that for the CAP at present, one does not have to have anything at all on one's land, which is unusual.  We will probably be told that under world trade agreements, one cannot promote farming.  One would imagine that we could have some minimum requirement, such as we had for the ANC.  On the definition of a farmer, in many farms around the country, a farmer has to work on the farm part-time.  Do the witnesses see problems coming from that?

It is more about complexity than anything else.  The more complex monitoring and control systems are, the more demanding of resources they will be.  We do what we can with our IT support systems to support our inspection and control regimes.  Our payment mechanisms are acknowledged as being among the best in the EU.  We pay our farmers more quickly than most member states.  We have a good record for the administration and making of payments.  If, as we have been, we are presented with a performance framework and new delivery model that we feel introduces a new layer of complexity and new requirements which we would have to incorporate into the system, whatever about the question of resources, there is a question about the practicality and practicability of what is being proposed.<\/p><p>In many cases, it is not about the availability of resources.  I mentioned the setting of annual unit amounts, but it is not certain that such a concept would even work.  We do not think it would work effectively or that it would stand up to robust analysis, so we have asked for a different means of complying with the requirement to measure the impact of these things.  Resources are always a part of it and we try to combine physical manpower resources with the IT systems we have put in place.  However, a complex model such as this is beyond resources.<\/p><p> There was a question about greening.  A new green architecture is proposed under the regulations, comprising three layers.  A basic level of conditionality would have to be met under Pillar 1, which is for direct payments.  There is also a proposal for an ecoscheme payment in Pillar 1, which would mean taking a proportion of the direct payment envelope and returning it to farmers who voluntarily decide to participate in such a scheme.  An ecoscheme should have an environmental benefit above the baseline that has already been established by conditionality, and conditionality is established by good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, requirements.  The greening components in the maintenance of grassland, crop rotation and ecological focus areas are being carried forward into the new regulations under the GAEC provisions.  There are additional requirements for GAEC, and statutory management requirements are there at the moment.  Together, they raise the baseline from the level of the current CAP.<\/p><p> Ecoschemes will add a bit more in Pillar 1.  The third layer is the additional benefit from environmental schemes under Pillar 2.  We have to look at what will be in there and the results will come out of the SWOT analysis, the public consultation and the needs assessment, which will happen over the next number of months.  We have given thought to what the options might be.  It is about striking a balance between meeting the basic level of conditionality and getting the maximum benefit by allowing the maximum number of farmers to be involved in the ecoscheme.  We will try to keep it as simple as we can and to add another layer in Pillar 2 to achieve further environmental objectives.  We have to think how this differentiation takes place in reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am always struck by the contradiction in which, in Pillar 1, the farmer sends in an application, which is done according to plots.

Alternatively, he could be told of a clump of whins in the corner of the field and that his payment is being docked accordingly.  There is an environmental benefit, from the point of view of biodiversity, to have a clump of whins in the corner of a field which means it is a good thing to let hedgerows grow out.  All over the country farmers are cutting their hedges down to the size of the desks in this room for no other reason than that they have had such torture from the Department, which has docked money from them because they had let the hedges grow out.  One thing that would immediately resolve a lot of the issues, for the farmer and the environmental scheme would be to allow flexibility in growing hedgerows.  In general, the cattle eat what is underneath them and the hedgerow does not inhibit them in any way.  It is better for the cattle and the farmer because it creates more shelter and the cows can be left out for longer, yet the Department insists that, even if the satellite photograph is out by just a little bit, the farmer is penalised.

This arises in the context of the proposals around convergence and the redistribution of payments within the CAP direct payments structure.  In addition to the capping and convergence that are proposed, there is also a proposal in respect of redistribution of payments.  That is still under discussion among member states and is yet to be agreed.  We have asked for that provision to be voluntary but the main mechanism for front-loading would arise in the context of convergence and redistribution.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we would have a proper environmental scheme.  We have to consider this in the context of the overall requirement imposed on us as far as this greater climate action ambition is concerned.  I have mentioned the three layers of the green architecture.  There will be greater environmental conditionality in Pillar 1, so for direct payments people will have to do more than was the case previously.  There will also be the provision for farmers to participate voluntarily in an ecoscheme which would provide further environmental benefit under Pillar 1.<\/p> <p>  Under Pillar 2, there would be a scheme that would provide even further climate results.  In the old structure, as it was up to now, there was greening, as there is under the current CAP, in Pillar 1 and additional measures under Pillar 2, such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which is available to all farmers and in which at least 50,000 farmers participate.  We have to consider what is the best combination, how we can achieve the maximum environmental benefit from CAP, and how we best resource it to get further benefit for Pillar 1, and then consider what the further environmental benefits might be from Pillar 2.  The question is what the options are.  We can return to that in the context of the public consultation and our needs assessment.  Where there are large schemes such as GLAS, which are open to many farmers, it is more wide-ranging, broad brush strokes.  It is also possible, however, under European innovation partnerships, EIPs, and other measures, to have more targeted, locally led schemes, which combine the various actors on the ground as we have done with the hen harrier and the freshwater pearl mussel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019070200002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Savage"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Does the Department promote locally led projects?

The Burren has been held up as an example of the kind of scheme we would consider replicating, but there is the question of how to pay for that.  It is much more expensive to support locally led schemes because of the range of actors involved and the particular circumstances in those areas.<\/p> <p>  It is a question of striking a balance, to get the maximum possible environmental benefit out of our expenditure next time around, and to what extent we mix the components to achieve a broader scheme or a more targeted scheme that would achieve particular environmental benefit in certain years.  That will be subject to public consultation and our needs assessment in the next few months in the context.  It is certainly a challenge for us.  At the very least we will have an approach that allows us to achieve that basic environmental conditionality in Pillar 1, add a little bit in the context of ecoschemes and add further in Pillar 2.<\/p> <p>  Suckler support comes up in respect of coupling.  We can accept the Commission's proposals on coupled supports.  It is talking about reducing that from 13+2% for specific schemes such as protein schemes to 10+2%.  We have a long history of applying payments on a decoupled basis.  The decoupled element which provides the income support to allow farmers make the choices they need to in terms of production, combined with the targeted measures we can put in place under Pillar 2, achieves the kind of ambitions we want to achieve.  We would not be considering a greater level of support as far as coupled supports are concerned.

I am the chief executive of Sightsavers Ireland and a member of the board of D&oacute;chas.  I am accompanied by Ms Fatoumata Diouf, Sightsavers' regional director for west Africa, who oversees Irish Aid projects on the ground.  She will present our position to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Sightsavers Ireland fully endorses the submission made by the D&oacute;chas group with which we have worked for several years to promote disability inclusion in Irish development policy.  For too long disability has been an afterthought in development policy, which has had the paradoxical impact of leaving people with disabilities in developing countries even further behind their peers.  The policy document, A Better World, combined with Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, better known as the UNCRPD, offers us a golden opportunity to address this issue, not only to hardwire disability into Irish Aid programmes but also to allow Ireland to be an example in encouraging others to follow suit.  As the D&oacute;chas submission highlights, we warmly welcome the acknowledgement of disability in A Better World.  In that regard, we would be particularly grateful for the committee's support in clarifying that disability, especially in the case of women and girls, is included within the policy's overarching commitment to reach first those who are furthest behind.<\/p> <p>  Under the theme of no one will be left behind, I amplify the asks in the D&oacute;chas submission surrounding engagement and the participation of people with disabilities who must be at the heart of the policy's development and implementation.  I highlight the critical need for a rights based approach consistent with the UNCRPD and the sustainable development goals.  I also hope the committee will work to ensure an integrated approach to the collection of data for disability inclusion in the areas of development and humanitarian assistance that commits to the collection of disaggregated data, research and learning and reports, including on the adoption of the Development Assistance Committee's disability marker.<\/p><p>In June 2018 the OECD released the DAC disability marker to track implementation of overseas development policy.  The Government has a key role to play in ensuring data for persons with disabilities are collected and used to inform the mainstreaming of disability inclusion across its development and humanitarian assistance programming and funding streams.  To ensure international comparability over time, we recommend the application of the short set of questions developed by the Washington group.  In implementing its policy Ireland should adopt and use the OECD DAC disability marker when reporting on expenditure and establish internal disability reporting mechanisms for partners.<br\/><br\/>In order for Ireland to be clear on how it will achieve its ambitious vision in the new policy, there is a need for a clear process for accountability such as the framework of action which accompanied the previous policy One World, One Future.  We also recognise the crucial role of this committee in ensuring accountability.<br\/><br\/>On Ireland&rsquo;s role globally, we call on all of its relevant stakeholders to play a leading role in delivering disability inclusive development globally.  Through its policy, the Government should consider how it will support the UN disability inclusion strategy which was<b><i><\/i><\/b>recently launched at the 2019 Conference of States Parties to the UNCRPD and use its membership of the Global Action on Disability Network, GLAD, to support global initiatives such as those made at the Global Disability Summit in London in 2018.<br\/><br\/>We would be extremely grateful for the committee&rsquo;s support as it carries out its work in this area.  We would like to offer our ongoing assistance in any way we can, including an invitation to visit our projects in Senegal and Cameroon to enable members to see the challenges people with disabilities face on a daily basis, as well as the support we are working to provide for them.  <br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.

Through this work I am able to see for myself day in and day out the impact Ireland&rsquo;s assistance is having across a number of countries in west Africa.  I will share some highlights with members.<\/p> <p>  In the area of education we have rolled out a pan-disability approach in our inclusive education programme, which means that we are admitting children with all types of disability into mainstream schools.  These are children with visual impairments, hearing impairments and intellectual or physical disabilities.  It also means that we are training teachers to be able to address the needs of these children.  We have also improved accessibility in our pilot schools to make sure the school environment is friendly for children with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Through our advocacy, we have put disability on the agenda of the government.  We have either supported the development of or contributed to inclusive education policies in our countries of intervention.  In the area of social inclusion in Cameroon, for example, we have successfully advocated for the inclusion of questions on disability in the ongoing national census.  In addition, Cameroon is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that has disability status recorded on voters' registration cards.  In Senegal we established the debates on inclusion during the presidential election in February and have had adherence by 13 political parties to include disability in their agendas.<\/p> <p>  In the area of eye health we have embedded a system strengthening approach in our eye health projects, with a focus on strengthening human resources for eye health, improving infrastructures and strengthening policy and planning.  I was delighted to be in Dublin in February to speak at the launch of Sightsavers Ireland&rsquo;s Put Us in the Picture campaign which included a photographic exhibition of our work, in partnership with Irish Aid, to improve political participation for people with disabilities in Cameroon.  However, as the exhibition highlighted, for people with disabilities, there is still a lot that needs to be done to ensure equal rights and equality of opportunity.  <\/p> <p>  In my speech in February I spoke about the key role Ireland had played in 2015 in co-chairing the negotiations that delivered the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as the sustainable development goals and how we hoped that this proud tradition could continue in helping to ensure disability was put at the heart of international development.  As my colleague said, we view the publication of A Better World as an opportunity for Ireland to be a champion of disability inclusive development, not only in its own programmes but also in its work globally at UN, EU and other international bodies.  Through our campaign, we hope to engage with the Government of Ireland, Deputies and Senators, Irish civil society and members of the public to make them aware of how they can be a catalyst for change and make a profound difference to the lives of literally millions of people who have been left behind for too long.  I am delighted to be back in Ireland this week to make that case.  We very much appreciate being given the opportunity to present to members and be of any assistance we can to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019070200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fatoumata Diouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Diouf.

I am the programme director at Oxfam Ireland.  My purpose is to share some insights with members of how a mainstream aid and humanitarian organisation can work to ensure the rights of people with disabilities in our programming.  More than 1 billion people in the world today live with some disability, accounting for approximately 15% of the global population or one in seven individuals.  Disability disproportionately affects people living in poverty, as 80% live in low and middle income countries.  Decades of work in the disability sector led to the formulation in 2006 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, which was adopted by the United Nations to protect and reaffirm the human rights of people with disabilities.  The Government signed the convention in 2007 and ratified it in March 2018.  In 2015 the sustainable development goals came into force to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The goals aim to mobilise everyone in the fight against poverty and inequality and ensure no one will be left behind.<\/p> <p>  As many of my colleagues have stated, the principle of inclusion of people with disabilities laid down in the convention and the sustainable development goals is reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s new international development policy, A Better World, which was launched earlier this year under the banner Reach the Furthest Behind First.  This development is welcomed by Oxfam Ireland and we look forward to supporting its implementation.<\/p> <p>  As Oxfam&rsquo;s mission is to fight poverty and inequality, we strongly support the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the focus the sustainable development goals place on people with disabilities.  Oxfam&rsquo;s code of conduct and our partnership principles protect and affirm the rights of the vulnerable people we seek to benefit, including people with disabilities.  In addition, in 2018 we signed the Charter for Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action.<\/p> <p>  With the support of Irish Aid, Oxfam Ireland&rsquo;s work focuses on the poorest and most marginalised communities in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe.  Within these communities poor women, unemployed youth, people with disabilities and people living with HIV are our primary targets.  Our goals are to provide humanitarian assistance and protection, for economic empowerment, gender equality and essential services for all.  We know that in these contexts very few people with disabilities access employment and that women with disabilities are two to three times more likely to face gender-based violence.  Literacy rates are as low as 3%.<\/p><p>In response to all of this we aim to create economic opportunities, increase gender equality and improve access to essential services for people with disabilities.  We also seek to amplify their voices by facilitating the influencing of policies and legislation relevant to them.<\/p><p> We have conducted research with Trinity College Dublin into the most effective HIV policies and programmes for people with disabilities in sub-Saharan Africa, using it to influence state and non-state actors on the need to design and implement these types of policy and programme.  More recently, in Malawi we conducted research into the lack of participation of people with disabilities in the formulation and implementation of health policies.  This is significant because Malawi has some of the best health policies in the world, but insufficient public funds means that they are not put into practice.  This negatively impacts on everyone, but for people with disabilities, it makes life even more challenging.  Take, for example, Mr. Peter Simoni, a wheelchair user and member of a local disability committee in a community where we work in Malawi.  There is no wheelchair ramp in the local healthcare centre and he is forced to crawl on his hands and knees to get into the building to access the healthcare he needs.  With the support of Irish Aid and through our work with local partners, he has been able to reclaim his rights and demand quality healthcare for himself and his community.  It included ensuring an ambulance designated for his local healthcare centre was made available for him and others who had previously been denied the service.<\/p><p> Through our humanitarian programme work on water, sanitation and health promotion, we provided dedicated latrines at household level for people with disabilities.  The facilities include improved access, handrails, raised platforms and combined bathing and sanitation units.  Households with people with disabilities are the focus of our emergency food security and vulnerable livelihoods work.  They receive unconditional assistance in line with the lack of mobility of people with disabilities and the burden of responsibility on carers of people living with disabilities.  Through our protection work, we seek to ensure the identification of those who are most vulnerable in a crisis.  People with disabilities are often the least visible and rarely heard.  We strive to ensure their needs and rights and those of their families are respected.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, we are working with Oxfam&rsquo;s global learning and humanitarian teams to understand better approaches to identifying and defining disability in development programmes and emergencies.  Oxfam Ireland aspires to being a champion of disability inclusiveness in the wider Oxfam confederation.  We work with local partners who have experience of working with people with disabilities to develop inclusive disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction guidelines.  More than that, we want to ensure all of our programmes and technical guidelines are updated to include the needs of persons with disabilities.  This will involve assessment protocols and accountability and feedback processes accessible to people with disabilities.  We also want to see consistent reporting of data and taxonomy for disability across all of our programmes, with disability responsive budgeting.  Ways should be found to ensure persons with psycho-social and intellectual disabilities &ndash; the ones most left behind &ndash; participate meaningfully in development and humanitarian action.  This will not be easy, but we are working with our colleagues in the D&oacute;chas disability inclusiveness working group, including CBM Ireland, to make progress.<\/p><p> Oxfam Ireland is fully aware that failure to do what I have outlined will result in leaving persons with disabilities behind.  It will also mean a failure to realise the commitments made in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and ultimately a failure to achieve the sustainable development goals.  We stand in solidarity with people with disabilities and greatly appreciate the support of the committee on this important matter and the requests made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019070200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Carty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to speak to it.  I will follow what my colleagues have mentioned, taking in policy issues and the pragmatic mainstreaming issues surrounding disability.  I will explain a little about how we work in CBM Ireland.  I work with it as international director for the inclusive development initiative, which is our work on a global level in the areas of advocacy for disability inclusive development technical advice.  CBM Ireland is an international disability and development organisation focused on creating an inclusive world in which all persons with disabilities can enjoy their human rights and achieve their full potential.  We work with over 350 organisations implementing more than 600 projects in 59 countries throughout the world.  I will speak about the very practical work we do in making inclusion a reality.  Much of what sits at policy level is rarely translated into implementation.<\/p> <p>  A core area of our work is concerned with disability inclusive development, DID, technical advice.  This is enabling the development sector to make progress in achieving inclusion through a global, regional and national advisory approach.  Within the disability sector and the movement there is a recognition that not everything can be achieved on one's own and that it is really about collaboration and partnership.  DID technical advice looks at meeting the technical needs of a global movement committed to inclusion.  As our colleagues in Oxfam and others in the D&oacute;chas working group have committed to disability inclusion, there is a need for advice on it.  DID advisers are a team with varied expertise applied specifically to identifying how development sector policies, programmes and organisations can become more inclusive of people with disabilities using the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, as a basis to ensure a rights-based approach.  Advisers come from a range of educational backgrounds with a disability focus, with some coming from health, legal and disability rights perspectives.  They all come together in an holistic approach to disability inclusion.<\/p> <p>  Technical advice also looks at providing practical support in achieving inclusion to support organisations to embed inclusion into their work and bridge the gap between intention and practice.  We have seen over the years that it has gone across a range of sectoral areas such as water and sanitation for health and different themes.  Advisers draw on each other and knowledge and staff from the broader CBM federation, where relevant, to strengthen the quality of advice.  The technical advice also looks to support development agencies to work with the disability movement in mutually beneficial ways.  For example, CBM Australia in its ten-year partnership with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs is looking to work on inclusion and with the partners of the Department on inclusion also.  Technical advice also looks at providing advice for a range of development actors, including supporting governments in policy and policy reviews, with other sectors in development.<\/p> <p>  I will speak broadly about how we have worked the advisory process for the past few years.  It has been done primarily in partnership with the disability community.  If we are not working with the disability community, we will not respond to the needs of the community and could easily co-opt such a disability movement.  For most, the partnership piece is really integral to doing development better; we are working with local and national communities on what inclusion means.  In any of the advice and support we give, whether to governments, embassies or donor agencies, we ensure people with disabilities and disabled persons' organisations are included in the team providing the support.  We prepare meetings and work with the disability community in advance to identify issues and deliver technical advice.  This process has been happening for a number of years, mainly within the Pacific region but also in other areas.  We are now looking at how it looks in Ireland.  There has been increasing demand in the past while and it is coming from Irish Aid's commitment to disability inclusion and the policy context of the CRPD.  There is increased demand for inclusion and technical support advice.  At CBM Ireland we have had a number of non-governmental organisations coming forward to discuss these matters.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of CBM Ireland have just returned from the UN Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities annual meeting in New York, where we led a side event on how to bring inclusion to a reality.  The key messages coming from it were about how we implemented the CRPD and the mainstream development and humanitarian actors could become involved.  There is an ever-increasing demand for support on how to be disability inclusive from development and humanitarian partners.  That is key.  Ms Carty spoke to it from Oxfam's perspective and other development agencies are also looking at it.<\/p><p>This represents a new way of working for all of us in the disability sector and requires us to think about new ways of collaborating to create change, because we cannot do it on our own.<\/p><p> Finally, I echo my colleagues&rsquo; key messages to the committee.  In order to not leave persons with disabilities behind, the Irish Government needs to materialise its commitment to the full implementation of its domestic policies such as A Better World, combined with Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  In the global scenario, it needs to support the implementation of the recently launched UN disability inclusion strategy at the 2019 conference of states parties and use its membership of the Global Action on Disability Network to support global initiatives.  Irish Aid needs to support civil society on its increasing demand to foster DID into their programmes and to support and enhance partnerships which acknowledge the need for mainstreaming disability into civil society.  Following the release of the DAC disability marker, it needs to ensure the data related to persons with disabilities are collected and used to inform mainstreaming of disability inclusion across its development and humanitarian assistance programming and funding streams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019070200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Keogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their detailed presentations on the many challenges that need to be confronted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019070200002#E00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The committee should have a meeting at least once a year on the whole area of disability, with the witnesses coming back before us to tell us of the progress that has been made.

They really brought home the reality of life for people with disabilities.  Disability cannot be an afterthought or tagged on to the end of things.  I have two suggestions.  First, budgets should be disability-proofed.  We already gender-proof and climate-proof them so disability-proofing should be seriously considered.  Second, a certain percentage of aid, whether bilateral or multilateral, should be directed towards the disability area.  We could have a campaign to achieve this as it is a very practical way to get funding.  There are many positives in A Better World but I am disappointed that disability is not on the priority list.

We should not be talking about what other countries are doing but should do it ourselves because anybody listening to this meeting who has a family member with a disability will know the hurdles people with a disability face as they try to get the supports they need.<\/p> <p>  The groups here today are dealing with the poorest and most marginalised in society.  How do their representatives believe Ireland can play a leading role in ensuring disability inclusion is at the heart of aid policy and the development agenda?

Other groups to have come before the committee dealt with the response to hurricanes and climate change and it is important that the sector represented here today is involved in those things.

These are basic needs but they are often left behind in a crisis.<\/p> <p>  Disability sometimes comes from a lack of healthcare, such as is sometimes the case with sight loss.

Our focus is making sure that is woven throughout that policy.  It is a great question to ask and we would certainly be collectively enthused about exploring that.  That is where we stand at this point.<\/p> <p>  On Sightsavers work and how we engage at state level, our focus as an organisation is on bringing about real sustainable development.

What I have learned is that we need to work at different levels.  There are many lessons that we can learn from our experiences of working on other issues.  I am thinking particularly of our work on gender justice, for example.  There is a real need for service provision at local level for people such as Peter who I mentioned in my presentation.  We can help to facilitate those services to be made available to the people who need them.  That, in itself, is not enough and it is not sustainable.  Working with local civil society in those countries where we work, it is a matter of capacitating them to deliver the services themselves.  It is also a matter of being able to advocate at national level for the changes that are needed from a legislative point of view and, critically, for budgeting decisions to be made that will support decision-making that is beneficial to people with disabilities.  Probably the most important ingredient in all of that is the inclusion of people with disabilities in those conversations.  It is not about any of us sitting here or in programme countries making decisions on their behalf.  We need to talk to people with disabilities, hear the reality of their lives and their stories and respond accordingly.

I apologise for arriving late; I was attending another meeting.  I can stay for the remainder of the meeting, however, as I do not have to leave at 3 p.m.<\/p> <p>  It was valuable to hear the emphasis on disability in international development.  I commend all the witnesses and D&oacute;chas on co-ordinating the briefings we have received.  We were all glad to hear the references to A Better World, the Irish aid policy.  The committee fed into the development of the policy and held hearings on it.  It was extremely useful for us to hear how much work is going on in so many areas under the umbrella of Irish Aid.  I note Irish Aid funds all sorts of programmes run by different NGOs and development organisations, which is positive.  I was also struck by the witnesses' emphasis on the practical implementation of and approach to policy.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple observations or questions, partly because last week I was honoured to be on an Oireachtas delegation to a conference of women political leaders at which over 80 countries, both developed and developing, were represented.  The delegates were all women parliamentarians.  Our focus was on how to work with the UN as women parliamentarians to implement the sustainable development goals.  One of the key points that came out of that conference was the intersectional nature of inequality and the importance of having an intersectional approach to working on sustainable development and on the goals.  Obviously, we talked about goal 5 on gender equality.  However, many references were made to the intersection of gender and disability, the particular challenges faced by women with disabilities in developing countries and the need to ensure that programmes recognise the intersectional challenges.  How do we all ensure not only that we are disability-proofing and gender-proofing but also that we are recognising all those different ways in which people experience inequality or oppression?  It is difficult to achieve that in a practical sense.  If only one of us had the answer, it would be great.<\/p> <p>  At the conference, we learned from many other countries, including in respect of best practice in some countries.  In Sweden, for example, the Government is explicitly feminist and every programme, including international development, is gender-proofed by somebody in-house in the relevant department.  It was useful to learn about that type of practical model.  I ask the witnesses to comment.<\/p> <p>  Another issue to emerge at the conference, one that is increasingly evident if one looks at UN programmes under the sustainable development goals and World Health Organization programmes, is the emphasis on public private partnerships.  This is interesting.  As parliamentarians, our focus is on the State response and what the Irish Government and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are doing.  According to the delegates from developing countries at the conference, developing companies are increasingly working closely with big corporations to try to achieve practical implementation of poverty eradication programmes, programmes tackling disability, etc.  Two examples we heard about were a big pharmaceutical company funding a major maternity healthcare programme in India and, probably better known, the major announcement by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation only two years ago of a plan to eradicate river blindness.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  Obviously, ethical issues arises, particularly where a pharmaceutical company is becoming involved.  That would certainly have been my view prior to the conference.  However, having listened to women MPs who were delegates to the conference and who have been trying to work practically and with limited funding in their home countries to eradicate river blindness or ensure that women do not die in childbirth, this type of programme has major attractions.  I do not know whether the witnesses can comment on that from their own experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019070200002#F00600","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Senator.  It is interesting because Sightsavers is directly involved in the programme for the elimination of river blindness.  Picking up on some of the comments made by Ms. Carty, the focus has to be on the local if one is to eliminate inequality or the imbalances, which our organisations are doing increasingly through a partner-driven approach.  Rather than implementing it externally, it is working very much through those partners.  As part of that partnership, we are always looking to work with more and more explicit guidelines to promote equality and so many of the different themes.  It is something on which we have been working very closely.  By the same token, when we look at the top-down approach which we take in working with Ministers for health and education, if we are talking about disability, gender equality or such issues, the challenges can also be approached from state level.  Between the two, from my experience of having travelled in Sierra Leone and having seen it being implemented, it is having a very profound impact, but it takes time to bring about changes.  There are cultural norms and things that need to be shifted, as they do in Ireland and other states, but there is positive momentum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019070200002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charlie Lamson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>On the point about women with disabilities, they have a double vulnerability.

The historical context is that the organisations were mainly dominated by males.  We have ensured there are women's bodies within the disabled people's organisations, DPOs, that we are strengthening to raise their capacities and training to be able to fight for themselves in order to have access to education and economic empowerment and to be able to advocate for women's rights, specifically, disabled women's rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019070200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fatoumata Diouf"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>In a final comment on private public partnerships, the reality is the problems we are trying to overcome are huge.

It would be naive of us to suggest there is not, but we have to be very careful about how it plays out.  Pharmaceutical companies' involvement in maternal healthcare which has been mentioned is compelling if one is sitting in a country where the maternal mortality rate is high and somebody is offering assistance that is very appealing.

My PhD was all about intersectionality, but trying to move it to the practical piece is the real challenge.

On this occasion we do not have to travel so far to be with them.  On a more serious note, I pay tribute to everybody present from D&oacute;chas and my own organisation, the Disability Federation of Ireland, which has been a part of this issue during the years.  I hope it will continue to be.  That is an expression of the responsibility we generally have in Ireland.  My organisation is about people in Ireland with disabilities, but one cannot be blind - if I can use the term - to the fact that there are people all over the world who are disabled.  I have read that 80% of the world's population of disabled people live in the developing world, not the developed world.  We have enough issues to be put right.  What must it be like for the others?  <\/p> <p>  I recall meeting a few years ago a lady from South Africa at an international summer school in Galway.  She told me that both of her parents were deaf but that she could use Irish sign language.  I asked her how this was so and she said the Dominican Sisters had taught both her father and mother.<\/p> <p>  Ms Diouf, or perhaps it was someone else on her side of the table, referred to maternity care and care for women.  The Medical Missionaries of Mary did huge work - most of the sisters were trained nurses and consultants -  in the area of maternity care.  What I am doing is drawing on the long-term interest Ireland has shown and the way in which it is now expressed.  I am referring to the fact that the Government, through Irish Aid, is more involved in this critical and important work.  I have used two examples of women's organisations to underline this point.<\/p> <p>  Sustainability is mentioned throughout the presentations.  We now have the issue of climate change strongly in front of us.  This has happened very quickly, but the issue has been around for many decades.  From my study of development economics, the way the First World deals with the developing world has ramifications for its progress as we tend to take cash crops.  Cash crops are grown in the developing world because we want them.  This results in land erosion and the movement of people into cities which impoverish countries that are trying to develop.  This has to have ramifications for people with disabilities and families on the margins.  That is a point on which people may want to comment.  How critical is the broader issue of sustainability and the interaction between the north and the south before one even gets down to granular level and specific programmes to support people with disabilities?  What series of actions or behaviours on the part of Ireland, in the opinion of our guest speakers, would give sustained hope to the people with whom they work?<\/p> <p>  To refer to some of the presentations made, Mr. Lamson mentioned that disability was an afterthought in development policy.  I have said many times before that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 should have done the business.  We are all human and have rights simply because of our humanity, not because we are women or men, boys or girls, come from different ethnic backgrounds, are disabled or whatever else.<\/p><p>It was not until almost 60 years later that the UN had to issue what I see as an apology, stating that it had not made that real for people with disabilities.  We have been involved in development aid since before the foundation of the State through religious orders, philanthropic groups and so on and, more recently, through our foreign policy, Irish Aid, and so on.  However, it seems that it was only yesterday that somebody figured out that people with disabilities should figure in disaster relief, development work and so on.  There is a cultural or other issue that makes it difficult for human beings and states to identify that.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses in that regard.<\/p><p> Ms Diouf gave a specific example in regard to education, mainstreaming and support for teachers.  Efforts such as that are magnificent in the sense that we put people away and we have had to try to unpack that.  On data and the census and so on, it is only in the past 20 years or less that the Irish census has had very specific questions about the extent of disability.  It is magnificent to have information on the number of kids and adults with disabilities in various counties in terms of participation, employment, education, housing and so on.<\/p><p> Ms Carty stated that people with disabilities are often the least visible and are rarely heard.  Even if that was the only thing said today, there would be very many threads to be pulled from it about what it leads to.  Each of the witnesses expressed how they stand in solidarity with people with disabilities.  The question for the committee and the State, which may not be answered today, is how we can stand in solidarity with people with disabilities and their families around the world.<\/p><p> Dr. Keogh and I have known each other for some time.  She carried out a significant amount of work in raising issues of disability and disability inclusion and the voice of people with disabilities in Ireland through the 1990s and into the 2000s.  I have a tricky question for her.  She has a sense of the difficulty and challenges of doing so in Ireland and is now doing something similar in the developing world.  What are the similar or different challenges in that regard?<\/p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who is coming into the room on cue, referred to a yearly meeting.  What would be a good and sustainable structure or agenda for that?  There would only be one or two meetings per year.  Other work must also be done.  What might be a good structure or some key themes for the committee, of which I am not a member, to consider in terms of making it useful?

In Ireland, there is an expectation for that not to be the case, but it still is in some respects.  In some of the countries in which we work, the available budget impacts on that because governments or the private sector do not have funding to invest in this area or doing so is not a priority.  There is also a similarity in terms of cross-impairment or cross-disability solidarity.<\/p> <p>  A difference I have noted through the years is how accountability is viewed.  In Ireland there is a strong disability movement which holds the Government to account and, in some cases, is adversarial in so doing as it may be warranted.  In some of the countries in which we work, there is no space to take that approach or it may not be appropriate because it is about how it is possible to work together for solutions.  That is a difference in approach arising from different contexts and different socio-economic, political and cultural backgrounds.

I often think about this topic, if one would call it a topic.  How are we doing as a society?  Are we caring?  Unless we have a caring society, all of these issues will become greater.  My fear is that, when the economy is improving and everybody is better off, we tend to move on and forget about many of these issues.  To establish concern, it is vitally important that people are continually made aware through our schooling system of the issues and the efforts needed to deal with them.  We should not deal with these issues today and forget about them tomorrow until they come up again in six months, when we will think about them again.  By and large, the Irish people are very caring.  I believe that is because of where we came from.  We were a very poor country.  We had to learn to survive and we cared for each other.  That was built up through the family unit.  I look around myself today and wonder whether we are as caring as we used to be as a society.  Those are the questions we have to keep asking ourselves.  Are the witnesses happy, unhappy, or somewhere in the middle about the manner in which these issues are dealt with through our educational system?<\/p><p> We owe an awful lot to the religious orders who were so deeply involved in the education system in this country.  The numbers in those orders are decreasing continuously.  That will have a bearing on our awareness of all of these very important issues.  We have underestimated the value of the religious orders that were involved in our education system.  They have taken some stick from various groupings down through the years with regard to interference and all the rest of it, but we owe an awful lot to the people in the religious orders who made us aware of a lot of these problems.  They also brought home to us, because of their missionary work abroad, what was happening in other countries.<\/p><p> It seems that, as a society, we are not as aware as we used to be of many issues, including not only social problems but issues with sight, which we are talking about here, and hearing.  As a politician, I do not hear people raising these issues as much as I used to in the greater scheme of things.  It is only when we meet people, such as the witnesses, who are concerned and involved that we get the opportunity to discuss these issues.  That creates a massive awareness, at least as far as I am concerned, about what we are doing about these issues and about whether we are slipping or getting careless or are not getting as involved in making certain that all of this training is provided and awareness is raised, particularly through our schools.  Do the witnesses have any recommendations in that regard?<\/p><p> I find that the social aspects of education have taken a back seat in our system.  People are more concerned about examination results and the standard of education at the expense of overall education in living, life, standards and beliefs.  I have 14 grandchildren, so I have a fair amount of dealing with the youth, and in my experience there are some tremendous examples of caring among younger people.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses as to whether there is something we could do to make certain that we never lose that and that it is part and parcel of the agenda when we are teaching our children at an early age.  We must create an awareness.  Things learned in primary school tend to stay with a person throughout life.  They certainly have in my case.  I was taught by the Christian Brothers.  They took a lot of stick, but they did an awful lot of good in terms of making us aware of our other responsibilities in life.  I am interested in the witnesses' views in that regard.

We found that Ireland still has a very proud position in the world with regard to its long engagement in overseas aid.  This engagement continues from the missions of the past into today.  With regard to the issue of disability within the State, we found that the issue has not really been brought to people's attention to the extent to which it could be.  People essentially left that part blank.  They were not quite sure and had not thought about it.  To me that represents a tremendous opportunity.

Last week, some of us met a senior UN official.  She spoke about disarmament and constantly spoke of the initiatives of Irish Governments, back in the early days of the UN, which led to non-proliferation treaties that were important for disarmament.  This committee engages regularly with Irish and international NGOs and a huge part of our work relates to development aid and humanitarian assistance.  In a report we produced on Irish Aid more than a year ago, the committee sought submissions from Oxfam and others and highlighted the need for disability-inclusive development.<\/p> <p>  The contribution of each witness has been welcome.  Ms Diouf spoke about the double vulnerability of a woman with a disability and the statistics she gave about women with a disability being two or three times more likely to face gender violence were frightening.  Disability cannot be an afterthought in development policy.  We do not have an executive role but we will engage with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State, as well as with Irish Aid, directly on the issues the witnesses raised.  We will ensure that these important issues are brought directly to the T&aacute;naiste, the Department and Irish Aid and in our future discussions, at official and political level, we will raise the dialogue we had today.  These issues concern people in the developing world, particularly those with disabilities.

The new double taxation agreement with the Netherlands was signed by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, on behalf of Ireland and Foreign Minister Stef Blok on behalf of the Netherlands on 13 June 2019 as part of the state visit to Ireland of Their Majesties, the King and Queen of The Netherlands.  The protocol to the double taxation agreement with Switzerland was also signed on 13 June 2019 by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Swiss ambassador to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will recall, arising from the OECD BEPS process, Ireland ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, last year.  The convention was discussed at this committee and in D&aacute;il Eireann and was included in the Finance Act 2018.  The BEPS multilateral convention updates the majority of Ireland's existing double taxation agreements.  However, as was indicated to the committee last year, our existing double tax agreements with the Netherlands and Switzerland were not updated by the convention but will instead be updated bilaterally to reflect the BEPS changes.  That is what these two agreements before the committee now seek to do. <\/p> <p>  We also indicated last year that the double taxation agreement with Germany will be updated bilaterally in due course.  Discussions are at an advanced stage with Germany in that regard.  As for those partner jurisdictions that have not yet signed the BEPS multilateral convention, Ireland has written to them to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  We are committed to ensuring that all of our double taxation agreements meet the minimum standards agreed in the BEPS process.<\/p> <p>  A common feature of both the agreement with the Netherlands and the protocol with Switzerland is the incorporation of strong tools for tackling tax treaty abuse and anti-avoidance measures.  Both contain the minimum standards committed to during the OECD BEPS project as well as a number of measures that are recommended best practices under BEPS, as agreed bilaterally.  The effectiveness of the anti-avoidance tools contained in the BEPS multilateral convention has already been demonstrated with the shutting down of the so-called \"single malt\" structure.  The Maltese and Irish tax authorities signed a competent authority agreement at the end of 2018 that will achieve this by outlining the common understanding of both tax authorities as to how the changes introduced by the convention to the Ireland-Malta double taxation agreement will impact this structure.<\/p><p>Ireland first signed a double taxation agreement, DTA, with the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 11 February 1969.  It is one of Ireland&rsquo;s oldest such agreements.  Throughout the past nine years Irish and Dutch authorities have been discussing replacing the existing agreement.  In February 2017 discussions were held in Dublin to agree on how best to incorporate the BEPS-related measures into the replacement agreement, as agreed to bilaterally between the two countries.  The negotiations were successfully concluded and that agreement is now before the committee.  <\/p><p> The new DTA with the Netherlands performs two primary functions.  First, the original DTA was agreed to 50 years ago in 1969 and the new agreement which is based on the OECD model tax convention modernises the double taxation relationship between Ireland and the Netherlands.  Second, the replacement agreement contains a number of provisions to deal with BEPS which makes the new agreement fully compliant with the standards under the BEPS project.  The primary changes in the agreement are, therefore, of an anti-avoidance nature.  In particular, the new agreement includes a principal purposes test as agreed to under BEPS action 6.  The test ensures any benefit under the double taxation agreement is denied if one of the main purposes of any arrangement is the avoidance of tax.     <\/p><p> Similar to the agreement with the Netherlands, the primary purpose of the Ireland-Switzerland protocol before the committee is to update the existing Ireland-Switzerland double taxation agreement to incorporate on a bilateral basis BEPS-related measures.  Ireland signed an agreement with the Swiss Confederation on 8 November 1966.  It was updated in two protocols, signed in 1980 and 2014.  Owing to procedural and legal issues in Switzerland which prevented it from modifying its double taxation agreements through the BEPS multilateral convention, it was agreed that the BEPS measures contained in the convention would be introduced bilaterally.  The protocol contains the minimum standards to combat treaty abuse and improve dispute resolution.  It also provides for arbitration when the two treaty partners are unable to reach a solution.  As with the double taxation agreement with the Netherlands, the principal purposes test is incorporated in the agreement.  In effect, the protocol changes the double taxation agreement in the same manner as if the agreement had been modified by the multilateral convention.  <\/p><p> The DTA network is an important aspect of our competitiveness in attracting investment.  In addition, the agreements are a cornerstone of Ireland's trade policy and stimulate trade and investment flows between countries.  They provide for greater predictability and fairness for taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations and are key to the prevention of double taxation.<\/p><p> The benefits of double taxation agreements are well known, but concerns have been expressed that treaties may inadvertently facilitate aggressive tax planning.  This concern was central to the BEPS project and the BEPS multilateral convention.  Updating our existing double taxation agreements, whether via the multilateral convention or bilaterally, helps to ensure they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning.  As has been shown in the competent authority agreement with Malta, the Revenue Commissioners will use the new provisions, where appropriate, to prevent aggressive tax planning.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the OECD BEPS process since its inception and continues to engage positively at EU and OECD level.  Proactively updating double taxation agreements is a key example of that work.<\/p><p> If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the making of the orders by the Government, I will include them in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by way of an amendment in the upcoming Finance Bill.  That will enable Ireland to complete the necessary notifications to finalise the ratification of both agreements.  I commend the draft orders to the committee.  I am happy to answer questions from the Chairman or members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019070200002#A00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.

It has long been known that the Netherlands tax regime in areas such as copyright earnings from music, etc., is far more favourable to taxpayers such as music groups which might have very significant earnings from royalties.  It has been well known for many years that U2 transferred a significant portion of its activities to the Netherlands because of the favourable tax regime.

Is it still advantageous for groups such as U2 to use the Netherlands extensively?<\/p> <p>  On countries which may have avoidance or reduction mechanisms built into their systems to attract investment and so on, a great deal of material published online via Wikileaks and the Panama papers which was published by an international consortium of journalists disclosed significant international tax avoidance by very wealthy individuals, banks and so on in various countries.<\/p><p>What has Revenue done to examine the situation of persons or corporations of significant wealth who may have been identified or related to some of these information dumps about tax avoidance?<\/p><p> Does the Minister have a view on how our tax structures compare with those of Switzerland and the Netherlands?  There is obviously significant competition for international investment and such but I think that most people, including in Ireland, want to see corporations and wealthy individuals paying their fair share of tax.  I do not think that is happening in a complete way yet.  How are tax authorities in different jurisdictions co-operating?  Much of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process is the publication and sharing of information and data.  Will the Minister share what has happened in this field that may mean that very wealthy individuals and corporations do not have the same arrangements available to cancel their tax payments entirely?  We saw one case mentioned prominently in the papers today about arrangements related to Luxembourg, although we are not talking about it today.  Effectively, by off-shoring property and other assets from Ireland, those involved could reduce their tax bill significantly, especially corporate tax bills, though I do not know about personal tax liabilities.  Much worrying information came through in the disclosures about tax avoidance.  What have Revenue and the Department of Finance done to stop the Irish taxpayer from being taken for a ride?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019070200002#B01000","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy, who will appreciate why I will not comment on the affairs of any particular taxpayer or commentary about them.  The Deputy asked if the ratification of this treaty would change tax laws for copyright or any earnings from music.  I do not believe they will although I do not have information in front of me about how the Netherlands taxes copyright or income from music.<\/p> <p>  With regard to how the ratification of this treaty will deal with the issues to which the Deputy referred, much of the answer is contained in Article 22 of the treaty, which is also referenced in the protocol for Switzerland.  In Article 22, we are introducing what is referred to as a principal purpose test, PPT.  This will deny treaty benefits to taxpayers when one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction carried out by the taxpayer is to obtain a treaty benefit unless it is established that granting the benefit would be in accordance with the provisions of the double taxation agreement, DTA.  This seeks to give more power to tax authorities to ensure that the interaction and engagement between different tax jurisdictions does not create an opportunity for highly aggressive tax planning or some of the issues the Deputy has mentioned.  Revenue's investigation division has reviewed the material that has come from the various leaks the Deputy has referred to and information that has come into the public domain.  I am always willing to make available any resource or additional power that the investigations division of the revenue needs to pursue this work because I know how important it is.<\/p> <p>  There are two significant changes in dealing with the issues the Deputy referred to but we are only in the early part of them.  The first is the exchange of information between different tax authorities that is now enabled by more countries ratifying the OECD convention.  I believe it will be a substantial development in ensuring that taxpayers meet the commitments that they have in different countries.  It is too early to put a figure on the additional revenue that it has brought to us but I am confident that, over time, that change will make a significant difference to the issues the Deputy raised.  The other thing that will accompany that is the global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, provision under President Trump's corporate tax reforms and the requirement that it now has for American companies to have a minimum tax rate of 13.125%.  If one combines that change with the work of the BEPS process, I believe there will be a significant change in the coming period in the ability to evade tax commitments and a consequent increase in tax revenue in different jurisdictions across the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019070200002#C00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>A concern that tax justice activists and academics have about double taxation agreements is that they often do not function to avoid double taxation but instead function to, in effect, enable double non-taxation, for corporations to avoid paying tax here when they would have to but also to avoid paying tax in another country because that country does not tax that activity in that way.

The preamble is now different to the texts that the Deputy would have seen in the past.  It is clear that not only is its purpose to eliminate the risk of double taxation and it is also clear that it does not want to create opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance, including through treaty shopping arrangements.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, that preamble was the text that the Revenue Commissioners then used in dealing with some issues that were identified with the use of the so-called and alleged \"Single Malt\".

I do not believe that competitiveness in the use of tax policy is only the prerogative of large countries but, I as I have argued in this committee in the past, I accept that big and small economies alike need to adjust policies to meet new international standards and respond to issues such as have been raised both here and abroad.  I have made the point that not enough recognition is given to Ireland for the change that it has made, in the person of myself and the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, in response to these issues whether through the OECD or with changes we have made ourselves.  I am sure that finance Ministers of the countries in question would make a similar point about the changes they have made.

It is important to recognise that credit unions, as volunteer-run financial co-operatives, provide an invaluable service to both rural and urban areas in Ireland.  As Minister for Finance, I am keen to continue to support the sector, and this is reflected in the regular engagement I have had with it.  In February, I invited a number of credit union stakeholders to an engagement session in the Department and it is my intention to continue this active engagement with credit union representatives.  I hope to hold more of these sessions in future.<\/p> <p>  In terms of regulation, the committee is aware that credit unions are regulated and supervised by the registrar of credit unions at the Central Bank.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions to maintain sector stability and protect the savings of credit union members.<\/p><p>Section 32(d) of the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended, provides that the Central Bank of Ireland may, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, make regulations prescribing an annual industry funding levy to be paid by regulated financial service providers to the Central Bank of Ireland.  The industry funding levy is not specific to credit unions and there is no statutory requirement under the legislation for the Central Bank to consult the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, or any third party other than the Minister for Finance.  However, it is worth noting that the final report of the CUAC implementation group, published in January 2019, makes specific reference to the Central Bank's intention to increase the industry funding levy for credit unions to 50% on a phased basis.<br\/><br\/>Since 2004, the amount of the industry funding levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01%.  Consultation paper No. 95, a joint paper of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland entitled &quot;Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation&quot;, was published in 2015.  It set out proposals to move from partial to full industry funding, noting a proposal set out in an earlier consultation conducted by the Central Bank, which was entitled &quot;Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters&quot;, or CP61.  This proposal was to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  Importantly, the Central Bank&rsquo;s feedback statement on the consultation process for CP61 noted the feedback received from the credit union representative bodies.  In its &quot;Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy&quot;, the Central Bank set out its intention to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs for industry, to increase the overall recovery rate and address funding gaps in specific areas of the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulatory activities, with a view to achieving full industry funding in the medium term.  In terms of credit unions, the Central Bank set out an initial target of 50% to be implemented on a phased basis by 2021 to 2022. <br\/><br\/>Having taken into consideration the unique and important role that credit unions play, I recommended to the Central Bank that credit unions be provided with a specific exemption<b><\/b>from the 100% target - the only part of the financial services sector to have such an exemption.  Instead, credit unions will be set a target of 50% by 2021 to 2022.  It is projected that this will be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis, with recovery rates to increase to 20% of the costs of regulating the credit union sector for the 2019 levy, moving to 35% for 2020 and to 50% for 2021.  Credit union recovery rates from 2022 onwards will be subject to review and a public consultation to guide strategy once 50% recovery rates have been achieved.  In contrast, the banks have been subject to 100% of financial regulation costs since 2012.<br\/><br\/>The committee members may also be interested to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, has now issued a public consultation paper on potential changes to the credit institutions resolution fund levy, which is expected to reduce materially from 2020.  This paper is open for consultation.  The deadline for submissions is Friday, 9 August 2019.  I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee and look forward to responding to any points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019070200002#F01800","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":243,"content":"<p>To clarify, the Minister said that in February of this year, he invited a number of credit union stakeholders to an engagement session.

The representative bodies, including the league which is represented here today, have pointed out to us and, I am sure, to the Minister, that they really should not be treated like banks.  They are not banks; they are not-for-profit organisations.  They believe and I agree that the Minister has not placed sufficient value on the social capital, the work of their volunteers, their community base or their democratic structure.<\/p> <p>  It is evident from the Central Bank paper, \"Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation\", that it is its intention to move to 100% beyond 2022.  The paper states that credit union recovery rates from 2022 onwards will be subject to review and a public consultation to guide strategy once 50% recovery rates have been achieved.  The Central Bank is very clear that this is its intention.  Why did the Minister not push back against the Central Bank and say this is completely the wrong time to impose these extra costs on credit unions?  Other levies are winding down but the big one, the credit institutions resolution fund levy, is still at a very elevated level at about &euro;7.5 million a year.

It will be a matter for the Minister for Finance of the day to decide when this period comes to an end and to decide the appropriate threshold for the next phase of the levy.  I have a clear sense that the appropriate threshold should be and is lower than what our banks are paying at the moment - they pay 100%.  I urge the committee to see this change in light of what will be happening with total levies in 2020.  Our judgment and analysis indicate that in 2020 there will be a reduction in the levies due to be paid compared to where we are in 2019.  While it is correct to say that the industry funding levy will be going up, it will take place at a point when the resolution levy will be coming down significantly.  As I mentioned earlier, there will be an open opportunity for the Minister for Finance in 2021 to review the future of the stabilisation levy.  My argument and contention to the committee is that, in the round and in light of all the levies that the credit union movement is paying or is due to pay, there is an appreciation of the challenges and pressures the movement faces and of the value the movement has for our economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019070200002#H00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The resolution fund currently holds &euro;268 million.

Significantly, the credit union movement is operated by volunteers.  Admittedly, there are professional staff in credit union offices, but the overall management structure is on a voluntary basis.  Credit unions offer banking facilities on a community basis not only for individuals in local communities but also for voluntary and sports organisations.  Will the Minister re-examine this until such time as there is a clearer pathway as to the impact?  The material I received from the credit unions indicates that they could be severely affected.  The Minister is now stating that the impact may not be as negative as feared.  If that is correct, then it is welcome.  Is my understanding of what the Minister said correct?<\/p> <p>  Comparing credit unions to banks is rather unfair, particularly in light of the credit unions' voluntary and community nature.  Moreover, they are heavily constrained, as the Minister is aware, in where they can invest because of their particular community and voluntary nature.  On the other hand, they represent vital financial infrastructure especially to the many communities where there are no longer banks or where, in future, there may well be far fewer ATMs.<\/p> <p>  The Minister should bear in mind the role credit unions play and the significance and importance of that role.  Is he stating that on account of other payments the credit unions are making for stabilisation, the levy will be mitigated?  Is he stating that he believes credit unions will pay less overall?  What if credit unions end up paying far more or, as the note before us indicates, are compared like for like with commercial banks?  I do not believe that is an entirely appropriate comparison.<\/p> <p>  The Minister needs to provide more information.  I am not sure whether the Department has carried out an impact assessment of the likely changes in the levy.  If the Minister has the details set out, can he supply the impact assessment to the committee?

We have approached this by putting in place a 50% recovery rate.  This means that credit unions are treated strikingly differently, as should be the case, from the other bodies to which Deputy Burton has referred.  This is precisely in recognition of the point the Deputy made about the capital or funding needs that credit unions have and the nature of the organisations.  That is why they are subject to a 50% recovery rate compared to the banks, which are subject to a 100%.  Those involved in insurance are subject to a 100% rate while moneylenders and bureaux de change will be levied at 75% in 2020.  We are looking to treat the credit union movement in a different way to other bodies regulated in recognition of the points Deputy Burton has made.<\/p> <p>  A point was made regarding the impact of the industry funding levy.  It would be fair and accurate to say that the increase in the funding levy is of course going to have an impact on credit unions - I acknowledge that.  Our analysis indicates that over a three-year period when the rate moves up to 50%, the figure will be a little under 3% of the current overheads that a credit union may be dealing with.  It will have an impact and I have no wish to create an impression otherwise, but I call on the committee to evaluate the decision I have made in the light of recognising the reduction in the resolution levy.  Notwithstanding the point Deputy Michael McGrath made, there is still a reduction in that levy and the stabilisation levy will be up for review in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019070200002#H01100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Minister is aware that I have already raised the issue of the credit union levy in parliamentary questions.

I am glad that this is now taking place.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, the Minister said he recognised the unique nature of the credit unions.  It is important to define that unique nature.  The stand-out difference between a credit union and a bank, a moneylender or a fund, is that the credit union is not-for-profit, community-run and volunteer-led with no big bonuses for board members.  Rightly so, the cost of regulating banks, funds, major insurance companies and moneylenders should be paid by the industry itself as opposed to from the public purse.<\/p> <p>  However, as a society, we have recognised there are important sectors whose regulation should be paid from the public purse.  We do not ask charities to pay for their regulation.  Accordingly, the State pays for the Charities Regulator.  Likewise, Sport Ireland regulates sporting bodies and organisations.  This is all paid for from the public purse because it would be wrong to ask local sports teams to pay for it.<\/p> <p>  While they are involved in lending money, the fact is that credit unions are not-for-profit, community-run and volunteer-led, which distinguishes them from the rest of the sector.  Outside of talking about rates and so forth, there is a question as to why we are applying this additional burden on them and putting a figure on their worth for society, as opposed to accepting they are unique in that they are not banks, moneylenders, funds or insurance companies.

We have already placed many additional responsibilities and burdens on credit union boards through legislation on skills bases, qualifications and so forth.  If we really value the work done by these credit unions, their not-for-profit nature where they lend money, as opposed to banks which are trying to suck the blood out of people, and their response to community needs, why would we even put them in the same category as the other banks?

The reality is that the Minister has a role and can take a role if he wants.  We can introduce a provision in the Finance Bill placing a cap on the amount the Central Bank can apply in terms of regulation of credit unions.

However, as consultation is ongoing we have not seen the outcome of that.

Perhaps he could inform the committee what that reduction will be.  The credit unions might be able to sleep easier tonight if they knew that levy was to be significantly reduced.  I understand they have been engaging with the Minister and wrote to him in April, but he has not responded to them.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, the Minister mentioned he proposed to introduce a credit unions and loans Bill in 2019.  He will be mindful of the moneylenders Bill that I introduced to reduce the APR that moneylenders can charge.  Some of them are licensed to charge up to 180% at the moment.  That Bill has passed Second Stage and is before the committee.  It was also signalled, because it is part of the same report, that it should be accompanied by an increase in the levy from 1% to 2%.  As I signalled on Second Stage, would it not be appropriate for that to be included as a Committee Stage amendment as opposed to introducing a different Bill to address it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019070200002#K01400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I did not say that the Deputy did not make recognition of the fact that the industry rate is half of that which the banks are paying.

What brings us together and unifies us is a common commitment to support people in need of housing.  The six organisations are actively involved in developing significant numbers of houses at scale.  We are here to talk about the fact that up to 18 months ago, we were classified as non-profit institutions serving households.  As a result of a recommendation by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and EUROSTAT, we are now classified as part of the local government sector.  That has had an impact on us in terms of our potential to borrow funds and build housing for people who need it urgently but not on the Government's balance sheet.  We now find that the debt we incur becomes part of the Government debt.<\/p> <p>  When this issue first arose 18 months ago, it was not a cause of major concern because the view was that there was adequate funding for at least two years to allow us get on with building houses at scale.  The general consensus was that we would look at this to see what we could do to get ourselves back into the position where our debt was off the Government balance sheet.  The reality is that matters have changed significantly in that time.  As 18 months have passed, we have used up 18 months of that two-year window we had identified.  In that time, a good deal of work has been done both by the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Housing Alliance to study the arguments, understand the issues and develop proposals to address this issue.  A positive development is that, in the meantime, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has supported our efforts to address this issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has specifically said he would like to see us overturn this classification as being on Government debt.<\/p> <p>  The most important aspect at this point is where we find ourselves in the country now, both in terms of housing need and homelessness, which are bigger issues than ever, but, importantly, in terms of macroeconomics.  We now find ourselves facing into a summer economic statement and pre-budget preparations that envisage two possibilities, one of which is that if Brexit turns out in the worst possible way, we could end up with a deficit of 5%.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, other issues have arisen that no one could have foreseen in respect of the cost of the provision of hospitals, broadband and many other demands on the Government's capital expenditure programme.  There is a particular concern that at this time, that fiscal space will be significantly reduced.  The State must examine how it can meet all those competing demands in terms of providing hospitals, healthcare, roads and all the other infrastructure that is required, including housing.<\/p> <p>  We are now at the point where a certain amount of urgency is required.  It falls to us to flag that it is important we are in a position to continue to provide the houses people seek, need and deserve and, by going back to the position we were in previously, can access finance that does not form part of Government debt.<\/p><p>That provides an avenue for significant delivery of housing in Ireland.  <\/p><p> The good news is that the work the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Housing Alliance have done allows us to take the positive view that we now have good arguments to address this issue significantly.  We are asking all arms of the State to come together to address it.  We will bring to the forum the information we have to address the issue clearly and effectively.  The time is right, but there is urgency too to assist the people the organisations were set up to help.  They were established as social justice organisations and charities.  Our wages are paid by our tenants, for whom we work.  Our purpose is to provide housing not only for existing tenants but also for others.  We are here to flag what is an urgent need and state there is no difference of opinion between us and the Government on the need to do this, but if action is not taken as a matter of urgency, it will not happen.  There is a need for engagement by all arms of the State to make sure it will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>As I do not have Mr. Dunne's fluency, I will read my written submission, a lot of which is similar to what our colleagues in the Housing Alliance have submitted.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the joint committee for inviting the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, to engage with it on one of the most significant issues affecting the sector.  I am joined by two colleagues, Ms Karen Murphy, director of policy, and Ms Tina Donaghy, elected vice president at the ICSH and head of development at Fold Ireland, a tier 3 body.<\/p> <p>  The ICSH is the national federation of 260 housing associations that collectively own and manage over 35,000 homes provided at affordable rents for families, older people, people with disabilities, the homeless and single people.  The housing association sector in Ireland is part of the wider social housing sector in Europe which has over 22 million homes throughout the European Union.  A common factor within these jurisdictions is state support, directly or indirectly, to house people in the social housing sector, including through housing associations or approved housing bodies, as they are referred to in Ireland.  Without state support, it is unlikely that many of the households in the social housing sector would be housed in accommodation with affordable rents.  Members of the ICSH include larger tier 3 bodies which are managing over 300 to 6,000 homes such as the Housing Alliance and local and regional tier 1 and tier 2 approved housing bodies which provide housing and related support services for vulnerable groups in local communities and respond to specific local housing needs.  Overall, the sector is committed to developing and managing social housing in the long-term and addressing the changing needs of the population.<\/p> <p>  I turn to classification.  It is now almost a year and a half since EUROSTAT reclassified 14 approved housing bodies, placing them within the local government sub-sector.  At the time and repeatedly since, including at this Oireachtas committee, the sector has stated its major concerns at this development for housing associations and welcomed the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, to work towards the return of all approved housing bodies to off-balance sheet status.  Since 2018, the CSO has begun the process of examining tier 2 approved housing bodies which include a mixture of approved housing bodies which are providing general needs housing, as well as those which provide more specialist housing for the homeless, older people and people with disabilities.  However, in the 18 months since the CSO's decision and its subsequent confirmation by EUROSTAT, there has been little concrete progress in the undertaking of a thorough review of the decision or a change management programme to reverse it.  The ICSH and the Housing Alliance have made proposals to assist a policy review and requested the establishment of a working group comprising departmental representatives and with an input from sector representatives.  However, that has not happened.<\/p><p>As a sector we have been working on proposals and have also commissioned research to assist in our work in this and related areas, including examining the scope of social and affordable housing as a service of general economic interest, SGEI, under EU rules.  In addition, the ICSH undertook, with Housing Europe, in 2017, a survey of the classification status of the housing association sectors in other EU member states and found the vast majority were off balance sheet.<\/p><p> In our view classification remains a significant issue, which will have long-term effects on the sector.  For now, the sector's ability to deliver homes under Rebuilding Ireland has not diminished in delivery terms, but this is under the current capital plan and in the context of a housing crisis.  Our concern is that in the medium and long term, the current on-balance sheet status will restrict ability to deliver social housing in the event of either a sharp restriction in the availability of public finances and a lot of other competing Exchequer demands, or in the event of a shallowing out of the political support for social housing provision.  It is our experience that the provision of homes for vulnerable and low-income households is a continuous requirement and the severe reduction of capital funding for social housing during the financial downturn has contributed to the lack of suitable, affordable housing now evident.  As a spillover effect from classification, a number of other public bodies are making public policy decisions based on the sector being controlled by the State.<\/p><p> We are grateful to the committee for this discussion today and propose that a working group be established to report within a six-month timeframe on a change management platform, which will work proactively towards reversing the classification decision, in co-operation with the sector, within a reasonable timeframe of 18 months to two years.  This would help to set a target to take approved housing bodies, AHBs, off balance sheet by budget 2021.<\/p><p> This change management programme could address contractual agreements, degree of financing and risk exposure, and will involve consideration of changes to legislation, regulation, financing, and housing management reform.  In doing so we will be helping to build further the capacity of an independent, well-regulated AHB sector that provides quality housing for the long term.  We are committed to working with all the key stakeholders to ensure the best outcome for social housing delivery.<\/p><p> Last year the sector provided 3,219 social homes, 38% of the national total, and took more than 4,000 households off the social housing waiting list.  A total of 54% were new build social homes provided by ICSH members to households on the social housing waiting list, 33% were acquisitions and 13% were leased.  As a sector, we have delivered 6,700 homes since Rebuilding Ireland was launched and we hope to reach our 2021 target of 15,000 social homes.  Our current pipeline is almost 5,000 homes or projects actually on site and funding approved to go on site.  This does not include many more homes currently planned and further back in the development pipeline.<\/p><p> The target for 2019 is approximately 2,500 homes, excluding leasing, which we expect to achieve.  As a sector there are challenges to the continued delivery at a high level, including the classification issue, high concentration of one lending source, access to land for continuous delivery, and the need for additional affordable rental options beyond current pilots.  The classification issue is the central part of these other key issues.  The publication of the regulation Bill is expected shortly and we look forward to that.<\/p><p> As a sector we are committed to the provision of permanent, affordable homes for people whose needs are not met by the private housing market and for people with special needs requiring housing and support.

I know the witnesses' organisations share that view.  I share and hear their frustration that, 18 months in, there does not seem to be much progress.<\/p><p>I am a little disappointed that we were not able to have representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with us today, but we will pursue the matter and have them here at the earliest opportunity, either before or after the recess.  We can only have half the conversation if they are not in the room to answer some of the questions raised by members and the panel; it is not a properly rounded conversation.  The committee has made a commitment to pursue that matter.<\/p><p> We did ask the Department of Finance for a written submission, which it gave us, and we are happy to share it with the panel.  I am disappointed with two parts of it. The Department of Finance states it has no direct involvement with approved housing bodies, that their outputs are outside the scope of its responsibilities and that its main involvement is in the direct collection of the necessary financial data to ensure the public finances are compiled and reported on accurately.  That point is repeated at the conclusion of the short submission which goes on to state an outstanding action point remains to review the remaining AHBs which were not encompassed in the 2017 exercise.  The only thing on its radar is whether the approved housing bodies that remain off the balance sheet should be brought onto it.  That is worrying.  While strictly the Department is correct - it does not have a direct departmental role with the approved housing bodies - it is central to working out the best way to solve the problem alongside the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the sector.  If the statement is a reflection of the Department's thinking, it gives me great cause for concern.  I wanted to share that view with the panel.<\/p><p> My questions are as follows.  In as much detail as possible, will the panel outline how often the ICSH, the Housing Alliance or individual AHBs have met the Department of Finance and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on this issue in the past 18 months?  The committee should know what level of engagement there has been and whether representatives have been brought in for meetings.  Is there a sense that the two Departments are co-operating?  I am not trying to get anyone into trouble with either Department, but the last time we discussed this issue it was clear that there was a level of frustration on the part of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government at the lack of information flowing from the Department of Finance.  It was quite open about it.  Has the position improved?  Are the Departments engaging with each other in any way?<\/p><p> I hear clearly what is being said about the supportive position of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, but does the panel have a sense that this issue is not a priority for the Department of Finance?  Without wanting to cause a row with one of the two Departments that are necessary to assist in dealing with this issue, is that where the blockage is?<\/p><p> I would like to know a little more about what both organisations mean by a \"change-management programme\".  Mr. McManus touched on some of the headline items, but what needs to happen to ensure the 2021 deadline will be met?  What does that change look like?  Both organisations are engaged with the Department on the regulation Bill, but is that change reflected in the legislation or will it need to be added on Committee or Report Stage?  That stretches a little beyond what this meeting is about, but it would be helpful for the committee to know where the regulation Bill is and what needs to change to meet some of the concerns expressed.<\/p><p> With the indulgence of the Vice Chairman, I have one last question.  The other big issue we are all keen to resolve is getting the special purpose vehicle up and running to access alternative sources of finance, including credit union finance.  There have been some exchanges between Deputy Darragh O'Brien and the Minister of State, Deputy English, on this and I am very sympathetic to Deputy Darragh O'Brien's position.  The Minister has said help and funding have been provided but that the rest is up to the approved housing bodies sector as a vehicle that can borrow and the credit union sector as a vehicle that can lend.  There is a lack of urgency in that regard, in the same way as there is in reclassification.  Perhaps the panel might update the committee on that issue andm in particular, tell us what the approved housing bodies sector needs from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Department of Finance to assist in gaining access to funding.  It is crazy that since the Central Bank changed the lending rules for credit unions, not one single cent has been made available from them to the sector.  I am a member of a credit union, as I am sure are other members.  We want credit unions to lend to the approved housing bodies sector for social housing provision.  Will the panel give us its view on that matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#J00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>We will start with Mr. Dunne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#K00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I propose to address the point about urgency and then hand over to my colleague, John Hannigan, who is also the CEO of Circle Voluntary Housing Association and chairs the sub-committee within the alliance that deals with this issue.  My colleagues can then join in as necessary.<\/p> <p>  The urgency is very real and immediate.  It is fair to say that when this judgment came down initially, many people, including ourselves, were of the view that we had time and that money was available for that year and for the following year to do what we are doing.  Significant work is under way and the funding is coming in for us to do that work.  However, we now find ourselves in a situation where that window is closing and many other factors, which I mentioned before, are now kicking in.  We are in a changed world and it merits a changed response from both Departments to recognise the need to do something immediately.  I am referring to the impact of Brexit, the potential for a deficit in the budget going forward in the worst-case scenario and the demands for other capital projects such as hospitals, overruns and so on.<\/p> <p>  Those are significant developments since that occurred and the other part of that is that the need for housing is so pressing.  People urgently need to access housing and that need increases every day of the week.  We put it to both Departments that we understand how we all started from a view where we believed we had time.  That time has now gone, circumstances have changed and we are at risk.  Delivery of the programme is at risk in the future if we do not address that.  That 18 months has not been wasted because from our side, the ICSH and ourselves have done a lot of work.  We have commissioned work, we have done investigation and we have got material.  The time is right and we are ready.  We need formal engagement and we need all the arms of the State to engage actively and to show how the commitment that has been made by both the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, to achieve this.  The time is right.  It is in the interests of people who depend on housing and it is urgent.

We have received information since that.  As Mr. Dunne said, we have done much work but we do not have a platform to share it on.  It is like <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>.  We are speaking about this issue again 18 months after we had this initial discussion in March 2018.  We would like to share the point to where we think matters could progress.<br\/><br\/>On regulation, we had initially mentioned that one of the issues with regulation was control.  If a regulator was controlling the sector that would have an impact on the classification.  The regulation Bill will be produced soon so we will see what happens with that.  The problem about contracts was one the points we made.  Any regulator should not be able to control housing bodies because in Britain they are seeing as controlling the sector from a public point of view.<br\/><br\/>That is the number of meetings we have had.  We have done quite a bit of work but the difficulty is in trying to follow up on that and to have an engagement.  It is difficult to have an engagement on that at a distance.  As Mr. Dunne said, matters have moved on in the last 18 months.  It is on the agenda for a lot of the housing bodies.  We still need to classify what will happen.  It is taking up headspace for many housing bodies both in the process and for new bodies as well, such as the tier 2 and the tier 1 approved housing bodies.  They will also have to think about it.  We are just trying to have dialogue with them on that since we have come up with the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I can speak to the Deputy's question about the change management programme and give some further detail on that.  As Dr. McManus and Mr. Dunne have alluded to, the first question would be whether it was a cross-stakeholder working group that was leading on it.<\/p><p>The first job would be to scope what is required and what that change management programme might look like.  We have drafted proposals containing our own ideas and submitted them, but it is somewhat of a vacuum at the moment in terms of the ones that would need to be progressed or what might need to be added.<\/p><p> In terms of our proposals, we would be looking at legislation.  The regulation Bill is a significant part of that but other legislative change may be required, for example, in respect of approved housing body status, which will be dealt with by the regulation Bill, but also other aspects of funding that may need to be dealt with through legislation.<\/p><p> Another one is looking at the financing, for example, a move towards a greater stream of affordable rental coming into the sector.  We can look at whether that would help in terms of the overall position and the criteria on which the CSO came to its decision.  If we had a greater degree of rental income from affordable rents, for example, would that change the position?<\/p><p> These are our proposals or areas for discussion.  We do not know, because we do not have any feedback, the extent to which one criterion is more important than another.  Much of the ruling was quite subjective.  It is about engaging with the other parties so that we know which elements of a change management programme should be prioritised.<\/p><p> There are other areas such as reform of the rental scheme.  The CSO pointed to the differential rents and the fact that they were guided by local authorities, which would be similar to housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, rents, for example.  To what extent is that a significant factor?  If change is required in that respect, we need to deal with that.  We would not see that as an insurmountable problem.<\/p><p> Another is in respect of the nominations process, which was pointed to in the decision.  We have suggestions in our proposals around choice-based lettings, which are used in HAP.<\/p><p> Looking at dealing with the individual criteria the CSO ruled on and the extent to which we may or may not need to make changes, we need to have that conversation and scope out the elements that need to be addressed and those that are less important.  There were some changes to the funding systems that we thought may need to be addressed also.  For example, the CSO criteria looked at the degree of risk the State held through contractual agreements.  Our view is that there is quite a lot of risk on the approved housing body, AHB, through some of the more recent agreements.  However, we would need to consider whether any further changes are required to balance out that perceived risk in the CSO criteria in respect of the financing.  There are some areas we believe could be on the table such as the historic debt and whether that could be dealt with in a way that would change the perception of the CSO and EUROSTAT of the way our sector is perceived to be controlled by local government.<\/p><p> Those are detailed, technical aspects of the programme that we believe could be brought in to address the CSO's concerns.  One or two of those elements may be enough to deal with the reclassification decision.  What we need to do is get into the detail of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Housing Alliance has met the Department of Finance once, specifically on classification, in the very early stages of the considerations, and there has been nothing since.  Along with our colleagues, we had two meetings with the Department, specifically on classification.  Obviously, other meetings take place regularly on other issues.<\/p> <p>  In terms of whether there is a sense of co-operation, there is a sense of wanting to co-operate but we have not seen any actual evidence of action.  There has been no action, as has been highlighted.<\/p> <p>  The change management programme was spoken about in some detail.  It is fair to say that a significant proportion of that will not require legislation but will require some rethinking, none of which would affect the status or ethical approach we would take as not-for-profit organisations.  From that perspective, we believe we can see reclassification happening without changing fundamentally what we are here to do and how we provide support and housing for our tenants.<\/p> <p>  The regulation Bill is an interesting question.  We have not seen the regulation Bill.  There has been no consultation with us in respect of it so we cannot tell the Deputy specifically what is in it.<\/p><p>What I can say is that in discussions with the regulator, it says it has seen it and does not believe there will be any additional impact in respect of classification.  The regulator will have learned from the changes in the UK to regulatory requirements which impacted specifically on classification.  In respect of what else is in the regulation Bill, I have no idea and most of my colleagues will be in the same position.  We have not seen it.  It raises questions that the sector it is likely to impact most is not being consulted directly in respect of its content.  That is a concern.<\/p><p> On the questions on credit union finance and the special purpose vehicle, SPV, a significant level of work has been done in our sector on the creation of vehicles to enable borrowing to occur with credit unions and other third party funders, including pillar banks.  We have been out to the market, as the Department and, perhaps, the committee have been advised, and terms of lending have been received from one of the credit union bodies.  We have not pursued that at this point in time for commercial reasons because currently we have nobody and nothing to borrow from.  My understanding is that the credit unions have not created a vehicle which is regulated by the Central Bank and which can enable borrowing to occur.  Discussions with credit unions are active from our sector's perspective, in particular with individual members of the sector, but nothing is being done in terms of a deal that would see borrowing come through to the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hannigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>There are different players on the pitch here.

Approved housing bodies are playing a massive part in Rebuilding Ireland and in the local authority sector.  Last year, they provided 3,219 social homes.  Local authorities are no longer building, which is a massive issue as we need to build local authority housing.  Reference was made to the number of meetings which had taken place with the Department.  My understanding is that approved housing bodies themselves meet with developers and revert to the local authorities.  Most of the work is done through local authorities and it then goes back to the Department.  Sometimes the local authorities do not even go back to the Department.  That needs to be clarified.  It is definitely the case that a lot of the work is done through the 31 local authorities with which approved housing bodies engage.  The bodies then work with builders before going back to the local authorities.  It is an issue I encountered recently.  It is important to build the houses.  The more we build the better.<\/p> <p>  I note that the ICSH and the Housing Alliance proposed that a working group be established to report within six months.  We need to do that as soon as possible.  The houses approved housing bodies provide are of excellent quality, which is important also.  It was stated that a local authority can nominate 75% or more of the tenants of an approved housing body.  My understanding is that local authorities nominate 100% of the tenants.  There is a bit of confusion there and it is important to get that clarified.  The approved housing bodies work through local authorities which give the names and then the meetings take place.  All AHBs go through the local authorities.  It is important to look at all areas, including bungalows for elderly people or people with disabilities.  It is important to build more of them.<\/p><p>When the Bill addresses building, it should envision a lot more bungalows as people are living longer.  I find it very hard to find a house for people with disabilities who are on the housing list, particularly a bungalow that is wheelchair accessible. <\/p><p> The delegates spoke about guidelines, rents and settings.  Only last week, a lady appeared with me on our local radio station, KCLR 96FM.  There is a beautiful housing estate which was built by one of the approved housing bodies and I have to say it is excellent.  Two local authorities, those in counties Carlow and Laois, worked together.  I note, however, that the rent for someone on the Carlow local authority housing list has been capped at &euro;180 per week, whereas in County Laois it has been capped at &euro;92 per week.  Some people are paying double the amount their neighbour is paying.  It is becoming a huge issue.  We have to be very careful where neighbouring counties are involved, although I know that the matter has to go back to the Department.  I have approached the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, about the matter, about which I am very concerned as it is causing hassle in estates.  We need to be wary of it. <\/p><p> Recently an approved housing body scheme fell through because the developer pulled out.  I do not know why, but he had his reasons.  Seemingly, 36 houses were left in Wexford.  What happened in that instance?  I think the houses were put up for private sale.  Perhaps the delegates might give me more information.<\/p><p> Lately a lot of local authorities have started to buy houses.  What is the reason for this?  Is it because they are cheaper?  Sometimes buying houses is fine.  However, we have to make sure people who do not qualify for inclusion in the local authority housing list or find it hard to get a mortgage will be in a position to buy a house.  Will the delegates update me on that matter?<\/p><p> There is a question I wish to ask again.  What have been the main impacts of AHB reclassification?  It is something about which I am very concerned.  Overall, great work has been done and there has been great management.  That has not been mentioned this morning, but the Housing Alliance has a great management team, which is so important and on which I compliment the delegates.  It is doing a really good job, whether the issue is anti-social behaviour or help with payments.  Perhaps they might come back to me with the answers to some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#N00800","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>A lot of what Senator Murnane O'Connor said was not directly related to the reclassification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#O00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>No, but it is part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#O00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Yes, I am just giving the delegates the option.

The current figure for the capital assistance scheme is 100%.  Under the capital loan subsidy scheme and the leasing schemes, all of the tenants are drawn from the local authority waiting list.

We could do nothing without them.  The councillors or members set the development plan for each county and we work with the executive.  Councillors decide the priorities.  The local authority is the planning authority for the area and makes allocations.  We play a small part in supporting it to achieve its objectives in the county and are very happy to do so.

We share her concerns about the rent caps.  A different differential rent rate applies in each local authority area.  There is a real issue of equity.  There should be one differential rent scheme for the entire country.  Whether a tenant is in County Donegal or County Wexford, he or she should be charged the same rent, based on his or her income.  That is the system we all want to have in place.  Having a system with a rent payment that is fair and affordable would be preferable for everybody, but we see a significant disparity because ours are national organisations.  However, it becomes much more immediate and pressing in the Senator's constituency where the counties of Laois and Carlow are literally across the river from each other.  People know that their neighbours are making different rent payments, which is a real problem.<\/p> <p>  We acquire units on the open market.  Most of us have programmes which include both acquisitions and developments.  We acquire some properties and build and develop some.  We do not see ourselves as competing with the private sector.  In fact, we enable it to do more as we can make deals with private developers.  Because developers have a guaranteed sale on a portion of a development they can fund the rest of it through the private sector.  We see ourselves as facilitating the private as well as the social sector.  The last thing we want to do is to encourage the idea that social housing is competing with private housing.  We need more of all forms of housing. <\/p> <p>  It is fair to say classification has not had a huge effect, as Mr. Dunne and Dr. McManus pointed out in their submissions.  That is because as a country we are doing a lot better than we were during the recession years.  As such, the impact has not been felt.  We are trying to prevent an impact in the future.  We are trying to plan for a situation where there will be many more demands on Government finance and the same level of funding will not be available for housing.  That is of what we need to take care at this stage.  If money can be sourced outside the public sector, the Government will be enabled to do more with the funding it has available.  I am just repeating what others said.  We have done a lot of work in the 18 months since classification, but we cannot do it without the help of the Department of Finance and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  To come back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, the Department of Finance has stated it is the lead Department in dealing with this issue.  It is a whole-of-government issue.  While the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government can do a certain amount, the Department of Finance is the lead Department.  Without its active involvement, we will not be able to do this.  As Dr. McManus said, if we can collaborate, liaise and work with the Department, we can reverse the classification decision.  In the North of Ireland and throughout Britain the regulator, the housing associations, or registered social landlords as they are called, and the Government have worked together to reverse the classification undertaken in 2015.  They were taken off the balance sheet in 2017.  We can do similar things but only in collaboration with the Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Gorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>On the impact, I would like to provide clarity on the figures in order that members know what they mean.  Until the classification deadline was set and while we were on the balance sheet, we were able to generate &euro;3 from the private sector for every &euro;1 we received from the State.  At that point the borrowings of the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, were considered to be off-balance sheet.  They are now considered to be on the balance sheet.

It is shocking that if Brexit hits us hard or some economic downturn hits us, the State could be prohibited from building public and affordable housing.  We need to say loud and clear that it is outrageous and unacceptable.  Because we are in that space, the housing bodies are being put under pressure to find other forms of financing and essentially fragment the social and affordable housing system, which fundamentally has to be about subsidised housing and has nothing to do with the market.

The more housing bodies have to do to get this off their balance sheets, the more they potentially come under pressure from private financial lenders on which they must rely in order to improve their balance sheets.<\/p> <p>  While I do not doubt the bona fides of the AHBs, there are questions regarding their becoming corporatised in other jurisdictions.  I was in a bar in D&uacute;n Laoghaire when I was approached by a man who told me that he is involved with a hedge fund in New York that is considering moving into social housing in Ireland.  The alarm bells started ringing as to what its agenda is in wanting to move into social housing.  By moving into this space, housing bodies are opening up the danger of affordable and social housing becoming corporatised where profit motives come into play.

A serious debate is starting on how capital expenditure generally is treated under the fiscal rules.  It is not working.  It is not necessary to be a left-winger; very mainstream people are saying there is something wrong with how they are designed and particularly with how they treat capital expenditure.  Nowhere is this truer than in the area of public and affordable housing.  We need to say that.

We had done some work at European level.  What is called social and affordable housing comes under the service of general economic interest rules.  Those are the rules that determine what member states can spend on social housing.  How is social housing defined?  In Ireland it is quite narrowly defined for people incomes below a particular level and certain vulnerable groups.  In other countries social housing is defined much more widely.  For example, in the Netherlands and Sweden it includes much higher income groups.<\/p> <p>  A number of years ago a few private companies in those countries took cases against the governments' social housing sector suggesting they were being blocked out from providing social housing.  There are many affordability problems throughout Europe not just on the social side but on the affordable rental side with people who do not qualify for social housing side but do not want to get a mortgage.  There has been discussion between all our federations in Europe on this issue.  The SGEI rules are very narrowly defined.  They are becoming more narrowly defined into targeting groups under certain income and vulnerable groups.  With the whole push on cost rental and affordable rental, there is a chance to widen those rules for not just social but for cost rental and affordable rental.<\/p> <p>  We have done some work on that with some of our colleagues in Europe.  We are a small country and other countries believe we are unusual in providing a very targeted social housing sector; other countries provide a much wider sector.  With the problems with affordable rental for middle-income groups, there is momentum at European level.  We made submissions at European level that the SGEI rules on social housing should be re-examined.  They will be reviewed.  There is a consultation up to mid-July on the service of general economic interest rules.<\/p><p>They determine the rules by which member states can allocate or notify the Government on social housing.  That is the area that can be examined.  We are interested because we are now charged with cost rental and affordable rental.  On service of general interest, SGI, rules, Ireland and other parts of Europe are moving into that space where we are talking about not only lower-income groups but other groups whom the market has failed.  The market has failed more people just outside social housing, which is why we are talking about cost and affordable rental.  There is momentum for that.  We have been pushing at European level for the SGI rules to be widened on that.  It is on our radar, where it would not have been so much in the past.  It would also be in local authorities' interest if the SGI rules were more flexible.

Taking an overview, Ireland as a country is facing a significant challenge.  The housing market can be broken into different sectors, and I often consider three of them, namely, people who want to get mortgages, many of whom cannot get one, people who want to access social housing and are waiting many years to access it, and people in the middle who would like to have a rental option and have certainty about rents and so on, which I would describe as intermediate housing.  There are affordable and cost rental models, and we, T&uacute;ath and Respond, which I also work with, are involved in trying to make that happen.  It has taken a lot to get to that, with 40-year money or cheap money and so on.<\/p> <p>  Ireland as a country must think about housing generally being provided.  All forms of houses are needed.  As long as housing is a commodity rather than a social good, we will remain in difficulty.  We have problems in all three classifications.  I have two sons and I have aspirations for what I would like for them.  I live in Clondalkin, which is an ordinary place, and I was able to buy a house.  As I get to the age I am now, I have started to wonder whether I will need a nursing home later and how that will be funded.  What happens to someone in a long-term rental with a private landlord when they no longer have an income?  The State already has difficulty paying old age pensions without creating another social transfer for housing on top of everything else.  There are fundamental policy issues which must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about our orientation.  We have two challenges.  We would like to support housing policy development because it has evolved over the years and can evolve further, but we also have a requirement to build now and to deliver for people now.  We tend to be pragmatists and solutions focused, trying to do something in the short term, but we would also like to see the bigger picture addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett to respond briefly, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin wishes to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#S00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>That is very positive.  It does not surprise me that Mr. Dunne would say that and it echoes the points I put to him.  It is important that that statement comes out.  What the witnesses have said here is very stark and very worrying.  We must say in the loudest possible way that the Government must go to Europe and make it a priority that public and affordable housing would be treated differently under the fiscal rules, because otherwise we could find ourselves in a position where we are not allowed to spend money on public and affordable housing.  That is just unacceptable.  Arguably, about 70% of people are being left out of the market and there is no chance that the private market will deliver for them.  That number is rising, whether it relates to affordable, public or intermediate in terms of controlled rents.  That is the space we are in.<\/p> <p>  The proportions in Rebuilding Ireland are the opposite way around in what it hopes to deliver, as was noted in the opening statement.  Would Mr. Dunne agree that is a message?  Perhaps the witnesses are careful about what it tells the Government to say and do, but we really need to send out that message.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about the pressure the associations are under.  I qualify everything by acknowledging they are trying to do the right thing and have a record of doing so.  In my area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it seems that, whether it is the local authority, the Government or whoever else is making the decisions about whether things should go to approved housing bodies or the local authority, a big and growing proportion seems to be loaded on the AHBs.  Certainly in my area, there is a reluctance on the local authority's part to do it.  I am worried that the pressure is building.  Does it put the associations under new pressures?  It seems that it does.  <\/p><p> A big issue in public housing provision is welfare related matters.  Local authority welfare teams are under-resourced and barely able to cope.  I suspect that the AHBs have even fewer resources to deal with welfare issues.  One ends up with tiers of support because of the pressure being exerted and the lack of resources.  It all becomes more fragmented.  There is even a problem in arranging transfers.  One association might have particular housing stock that has one or two bedrooms and there is the question of whether someone who has children can secure a transfer.  It proves difficult because the system is fragmented.  It is a big problem and I am interested in learning how the delegates see it.  There is a need for much more integration and consistency in the provision of support and resources.  There are those who are above the thresholds which are ridiculously low and who are caught in no man's land.  Last week I put the following point to representatives of the National Development Finance Agency.  They did not disagree, although it was obviously difficult for them to say things, that affordability should be based on a proportion of income and that the affordable scheme should be back fitted to ensure that would be the case, rather than being dependent on site-specific costs, specific servicing costs or whatever else.  It is crazy.  Something is either affordable for ordinary people on average incomes or it is not.  Surely it cannot be dependent on peculiarities, geographical position or specific site characteristics or from where the finance is coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#S00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

That is a group that was established by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to examine ways by which private sector real estate trust investment in social housing provision could be facilitated.  In an equivalent period it had over 25 meetings.  I know this because I submitted a request under freedom of information legislation.  I received over 32 records or documents in response to that request.  It was a stack that was inches thick.  The delegates have had three meetings with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, while the Housing Alliance has had one meeting with the Department of Finance.  It has submitted documentation but received no response.  That says a lot.  The Department of Finance had no difficulty in being part of the inter-departmental group, contrary to what it has stated in its submission today that the AHB issue is not one for it.  When it was an issue of private finance coming through a different mechanism, the Department had no difficulty.  That highlights the problem.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett made an important point.  The CSO set out concerns in its initial determination with which EUROSTAT agreed, namely, issues related to financing, contracts, regulations and risk exposure.  However, EUROSTAT went one step further.  It was concerned not only with governance issues but also the relationship between rents - social rents and the level and movement of market rents and how they affected the AHB sector's investment decisions.  That is a much bigger issue than that raised by the CSO.<\/p><p>There are ways of tackling that first group of issues that the CSO highlighted without undermining the body's ethos.  I worry about the mistake that British AHBs made, which was to tackle the issue of rents, market fluctuations and investment decisions, they went further and they have gone down a trajectory of undermining their ethos.  The jury is out and, depending on what the Minister comes back with, we can make some judgments.<\/p><p> Has the Housing Alliance of Ireland has made proposals to the Department or does it have a view on the second to last paragraph in the conclusions of the EUROSTAT document, regarding the additional criteria?  That is a worry.  Even if the AHBs do not want to, they may become sub-market operators as they are in Britain rather than not-for-profit and voluntary social housing providers.  I have not heard anybody coming up with a way of responding to that.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the witnesses said there has been no impact on delivery.  One of the main worries many of us had when the AHBs were put on balance sheet was that they would have to jump through the same hoops and four stages in the development pipeline as local authorities.  I take from the comments that, so far, the Departments dealing with housing and finance have been pretty hands-off in how they do their business once they get approval.

That is my experience in Respond! at least.  We all have to think about the market and economics but we need a functioning housing market.  How will we retain young people in our country otherwise?  Why should they stay here?  How will we get key workers in cities when their rent or housing costs are so high?  How will we attract the large intellectual property companies on which we depend?

Our hand is stronger than it was 12 months ago in trying to reverse this problem.  We have a common cause.  It is important that homes are seen as lifetime homes and such issues are not commodified.  The market should not suck out large lumps of profit while providing people with homes.

When we go to meetings they do not speak about this.  In fact, they do not want to get involved because they do not want to get dragged into this Irish problem.  They are keeping their heads down and stating the Irish are up to something but they do not want to get involved in it.  There are various traditions in the history of social housing throughout the European Union.  Many of them have focused on rent type structures, such as cost rent or economic rent, that allows the provision of State support but also means income is received from tenants and there is a HAP-type support for tenants who cannot meet the rent level.<\/p><p>By and large, this is not an issue.  I am not aware of a campaign by EUROSTAT throughout the European Union to target social housing to put it on-balance-sheet.  We were annoyed when it happened.  We thought we were unfairly picked out as a sector for this classification.  This has not been a widespread issue throughout the European Union.  Social housing provision in Ireland has become narrow.  It used to be wider with council housing back in the 1950s and 1960s when income groups were housed.<\/p><p> The rules at European level are a big issue.  There is exemption from the notification of state aid if there is a targeted social housing definition.  This should be re-examined and widened for Ireland and for other countries as there are real affordability problems in other major urban centres.  There is momentum throughout Europe to look at the service of general interest, which are the rules by which a country can allocate state funding to social housing.<\/p><p> Aligned to the classification issue, which is what we are focusing on today, is seeing whether there could be a re-examination of the definition of the services of general economic interest rules in the current European climate, where housing affordability is a major problem, to allow more targeted social housing and to allow for a new income group.  We must appreciate that affordable housing is a slippery term.  Sometimes it is 35% of income and there is a question of who qualifies.  Where the European Union rules come into play is where the market has failed and it is incumbent on a member state to be able to provide state aid, whether through subsidies or land.  This issue could be grappled at the same time as the classification issue.  It is a wider issue, as Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned, but it is one that could be looked at here and at European level where there is common interest.<\/p><p> We provide a lot of capital funding for social housing, unlike the UK which moved into the private financing of social housing 30 or 40 years ago.  We will shift from 100% capital to 30% capital in between five and seven years.  This is a record change for any sector in Europe.  In one sense we are working our way through it.  We are not experts but we have made a fair stab at it to get to this stage, working with local authorities.  There are a few things we could look at, including the European rules on services of general economic interest.  They could certainly be explored so we can have a discussion and speak to people about them at European and national level.  Conversations on classification and the services of general economic interest rules could certainly be had in the current housing environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019070200002#W01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":380,"content":"<p>The 30% capital is practically non-existent when purchasing within Dublin because of the high cost of rent.

I thank the committee for inviting us here today to talk about how Ireland's birds are faring.  The primary objective of BirdWatch Ireland is the conservation of wild birds and their habitats and biodiversity.  Our organisation is the largest independent nature conservation charity in Ireland with 15,000 members, a network of 25 branches nationwide, and more than 1,500 volunteer surveyors who contribute thousands of hours of survey time to collecting information on our wild birds.  We are a science-based organisation and our staff include internationally recognised experts.  We are the Irish representative of BirdLife International, the world&rsquo;s largest conservation partnership, and we collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders to achieve our goals.  Today we will outline the conservation status of Ireland's wild birds, the pressures and threats they are facing, what we are doing to help, and what else needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  The D&aacute;il declared a biodiversity and climate emergency on 9 May 2019 and called for biodiversity loss to be addressed by a citizens&rsquo; assembly.  This indicates that, as a nation, we recognise that urgent action is needed to protect and safeguard our environment into the future.  This year is BirdWatch Ireland&rsquo;s 50th anniversary.  In the past 50 years Ireland has seen dramatic changes to its landscape and to its biodiversity.  Birds are key indicators of the health of our environment and they face many challenges.<\/p><p>Significant changes are evident in bird populations, most sadly for the worse.  There are some good news stories, but the trends for some key species groups are very worrying.<\/p><p> With our mild climate and vast, abundant wetlands, Ireland attracts thousands of migrant waterbirds every winter.  For the past 25 years, we have monitored their populations through the Irish Wetland Bird Survey, I-WeBS, funded by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and co-ordinated by BirdWatch Ireland, with help from our volunteer network.  Each year, approximately 11,000 volunteer hours are contributed to the survey by irreplaceable, skilled individuals who care about, and want to protect their local birds and wetlands.  Our most recent I-WeBS survey analyses show that Ireland has lost in the region of 500,000 waterbirds, almost 40%, in less than 20 years.  In detail, the analysis shows that over half of the 15 wader species that regularly winter here have declined.  For example, the number of wintering lapwings has decreased by 67% in less than 20 years.  Mallard &ndash; a duck so familiar to everyone that it is often overlooked &ndash; has declined by over 40% in the past 20 years.  Habitat loss, climate change and cumulative impacts represent the main pressures on and threats to our wintering waterbirds, and urgent action is needed to protect areas important for them and to maintain this diversity of species.<\/p><p> Farmland in Ireland has changed dramatically in the past 50 years.  The Countryside Bird Survey, a BirdWatch Ireland-led citizen science-based survey, funded by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, has been running since the late 1990s and monitors the most common breeding birds in the Irish landscape.  Results indicate that although many common species, such as goldfinch and blackcap, are stable or increasing, about a quarter of familiar farmland birds, such as stock dove, swift, greenfinch, stonechat and kestrel are exhibiting serious declines.<\/p><p> More detailed knowledge of longer-term trends in all bird populations comes from another volunteer-based survey, the Bird Atlas, the most recent of which was completed in 2011.  Bird atlases allow us to monitor change over the longer term and are particularly important in highlighting declines indicative of dramatic changes in the Irish landscape.  The atlas shows that our once biodiversity-rich farmland landscape has become less hospitable for wildlife as agricultural methods and technologies have intensified.  This is clearly reflected in the almost complete extermination of farmland birds such as the corncrake.  Once widespread, corncrakes are now confined to the most marginal areas of the west and north west as late-cut hay meadows have been used for multiple-cut silage.  Similarly, severe declines have been recorded in most of our breeding waders, including the curlew, the lapwing and the snipe.  These species, once widespread and familiar to many farmers because they nest in damp pastures, traditional hay meadows and bogs, are disappearing.  Curlew is one of the most severely impacted and is now on the verge of extinction, with only about 150 pairs remaining of the 5,000 pairs that nested here in the 1960s and 1970s.  Once, not long ago, the famed cry of the curlew was literally the sound of wild Ireland.  However,  most of the curlew's former strongholds have fallen silent.<\/p><p> The main reason for the declines of many farmland birds is habitat loss - the widespread drainage of wetlands and damp pastures and the more intensive management of agricultural grasslands through reseeding and increased fertiliser use.  Other factors include industrial-scale extraction of peat bogs and afforestation of habitats.  Remaining populations of many farmland species, particularly ground-nesting birds, are now much more isolated, and are affected by predation.  The loss of mixed and arable farming has also affected species such as the yellowhammer and the skylark.  This resulted in the extinction of the corn bunting in Ireland in 1991.<\/p><p> While agri-environment schemes such as GLAS, through which farmers are incentivised to work the land in an environmentally friendly way, have gone some way towards maintaining or, in certain cases, improving bird habitats on farmland, such schemes do not go far enough.  Activities such as inappropriate hedge-cutting and the burning of scrub and upland habitats are detrimental to our native wildlife and affect our carbon stores.  The changes to the Wildlife Act contained in the Heritage Act, passed last year, have sadly weakened the protections afforded to breeding birds of uplands and hedgerows and must be repealed.  Water quality in lakes and rivers affected by nutrient run-off and other inputs can reduce the number of invertebrates, which in turn has a knock-on effect on birds living in these aquatic habitats, such as the dipper, the kingfisher and the grey wagtail.<\/p><p> Raptors are apex predators at the top of the food chain and hence can be affected by a range of changes and pressures in the environment.  There have been several positive conservation success stories, such as the return, through reintroduction, of species such as the eagle and the red kite.  Buzzard and peregrine falcon populations are recovering in the Irish landscape after almost disappearing.  Unfortunately, however, many of the issues that have caused the declines and extinctions of birds of prey are still present in the countryside.  The illegal killing of birds of prey, through shooting and indiscriminate poisoning, remains prevalent and affects a wide range of species.  To tackle these wildlife crimes, there is a need for greater emphasis on investigation and enforcement of the legislation, including better resourcing of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and greater collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Raptors can also be exposed to other poisons that are legally used, such as rodenticides, which are targeted at controlling rats and mice.<\/p><p> The barn owl is a red-listed species of conservation concern and its population has declined dramatically, largely due to land-use changes and the intensification of agriculture, which has caused the reduction in the extent and quality of habitats available to it.  Hen harrier populations have also declined for similar reasons.  Much of its upland nesting habitat has been lost to the planting of non-native conifer plantations<\/p><p> There are many species of birds that coexist with humans, living among us in our cities, towns and villages.  We often refer to these as &ldquo;urban birds&rdquo;.  The swift population has undergone a 50% decline in the past 20 years.  Factors include the loss of nest sites in the fabric of our older buildings, where access to the roof space and gaps in masonry have housed their nests for generations.  The demolition, renovation and retrofitting of old buildings displace nesting swifts by removing the vital access they once had.  Once a swift loses its nest site, it can mean many lost breeding seasons before the monogamous pair finds new suitable nest sites and can breed again.  Other impacts include climate change and, in particular, the decline in insects, which the swift solely relies on for food.<\/p><p> A familiar visitor to Dublin from Arctic Canada is the brent goose.  Ireland hosts a high percentage of the global population of this species.  They are threatened by the squeeze for space, which is far greater in our capital than anywhere else in the country due to the rate of development.  Brent geese need permanent short grassland swards, such as playing pitches, to graze in the lean months of the winter.  Such site sites which are disappearing in our capital.<\/p><p> Ireland supports internationally or even globally important populations of a number of seabirds.  Puffins and kittiwake are globally threatened and have declining populations in Ireland, whilst the black-headed gull and herring gull are on the Irish red list due to a dramatic decline in breeding numbers in recent decades.  Climate change is probably the most serious threat to seabirds.  As the oceans warm, their food sources change.  Other serious threats include sea level rise, oil pollution and the increasing abundance of ingested plastics in the seabird diet, in addition to fatal entanglement in discarded fishing gear and non-sustainable fisheries practices.<\/p><p> BirdWatch Ireland staff have been involved in active conservation projects for terns, including the roseate terns on Rockabill, which is located off the coast near Skerries.  This has been a profoundly successful project and shows what can be achieved with the input of resources.  In the last 30 years, the number of roseate terns has increased from 152 breeding pairs of to 1,597.<\/p><p> What is being done to address declines of bird populations?  BirdWatch Ireland uses many tools to further conservation efforts, including large-scale EU-funded conservation projects.  Nationally funded work includes long-term management, protection, and research on and monitoring of several important species groups.  Our advocacy and awareness-raising work seeks to influence decision makers to improve policies that affect bird populations and engage with the public on the issues facing birds and their habitats.  There are other actions happening all around the country, supported by the Government and concerned members of communities, which is heartening.  It is clear that Irish people care deeply about their natural heritage, as witnessed by the green wave that has taken hold in recent times.  However, we will need to take further significant action if we are to protect bird life and nature on our island.<\/p><p> Ireland is in the midst of a biodiversity crisis.  Saving biodiversity in Ireland is the responsibility of all of Departments and sectors, and all stakeholders have a part to play in this regard.  The Government must ensure that sectoral policies cohere with the policies and legal obligations to protect and conserve biodiversity.  Tackling the chronic historic cuts to funding to protect biodiversity is essential.<\/p><p>Now is the time to bolster this funding to ensure that we can continue to avail of the ecosystem services that nature provides.  Full implementation of the national biodiversity action plan is a must before it expires in 2021.  In addition, we must act to stem the worst impacts of climate breakdown, including using nature-based solutions for climate action.<\/p><p> The farmed landscape supports some of our most threatened and declining species.  One of our most important messages to the committee is that Government policy must urgently recognise and reward sustainable and low-intensity farming systems that are supporting birds and other biodiversity.  The policy direction of Food Wise 2025 is contrary to this in practice and this does not bode well for biodiversity, for the climate or for farmers on marginal land.  Ireland&rsquo;s climate ambition relies heavily on forestry but forestry policy to date represents a significant pressure and threat to biodiversity, with insufficient safeguards for high nature value farmland, ground nesting birds and other wildlife.<\/p><p> In respect of our vast marine area, Ireland needs to fully implement the Common Fisheries Policy and the marine strategy framework directive.

I do not know whether I am happy or depressed to have heard what Ms Duggan just said.  I will ask a number of questions and I invite any of the witnesses to answer them.  They might give partial answers here but they might give more specific answers because I know they have to run through something for seven or eight minutes, which does not really allow the witnesses to stop and really go into these matters.  Who is really listening to BirdWatch Ireland?  Is there anybody listening?  Who is seriously listening to BirdWatch Ireland?  I know the witnesses are seriously listening to themselves because without all those volunteers, ornithologists and people interested in birds involved in its organisations, it would not even be out the door.<\/p> <p>  How does BirdWatch Ireland feel that the Government's announcement of the natural environment emergency, which was a major announcement, will help it?  What is the practicality of that?  Since that announcement, have there been promises and what are those?  It is one thing to announce an emergency but it is another thing to announce pillars around what will be done about it and how the different aspects of it will be tackled.<\/p> <p>  This next matter is a bugbear of mine and the Chairman will know this.  Does BirdWatch Ireland think there is a case now, which BirdWatch Ireland should be making, along with all our natural environment bodies, for a Department of natural environment?  In other words, the stage should not be shared with culture or language, which are also important, but we have come to the stage where a Department of natural environment is as important as a Department of Finance because it has so many leaves of our lives in it.  What does BirdWatch Ireland think about that?<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a lot of advice for farmers.  There is never a lot of advice for industry and for construction.  Why is attention not being paid to those?  I know there is an intensification of farming but there is also an intensification of building and that affects our seabirds.  Is there advice for those companies?  Is BirdWatch Ireland involved in such communication?<\/p> <p>  There was one sentence in the opening statement that is an example of something I would like the witnesses to explain.  One of my favourite species of birds in the whole world are swifts because they are such geniuses.  Education plays a huge part in this with young people because they have more of a sense of what is in the air than we possibly had.  In its opening statement, BirdWatch Ireland stated \"The most important action which could be taken by government is to ensure that sectoral policies are coherent with the policies and legal obligations to protect and conserve biodiversity, including our wild birds and their habitats.\"  That is so convoluted.  What does BirdWatch Ireland mean by that?<\/p> <p>  That is about all.  I thank the witnesses but we should have more from them and we need to hear more from BirdWatch Ireland at this level all the time.  Members of the committee run in and out of here from attending meetings about finance, insurance, education and needs but we need to hear from the witnesses far more.  BirdWatch Ireland needs to demand that it is here just as much as the other groups that seem to be in all the different committees because everything it is saying has a part to play in every committee, not just this committee, but also the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  BirdWatch Ireland has so much to say.  One of the most important things Ms Duggan said was that the birds will tell us how healthy our environment is.  It is all in that sentence.  I want to see BirdWatch Ireland more, so the witnesses should think about how they can come into the Houses more.  It is as important for them to speak to every committee, including the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and all of these committees where everybody runs the issue of health into them.  BirdWatch Ireland has as much of a right to be there and as great a part to play.<\/p> <p>  That could be easily done, especially in this climate.  We need a Department of natural environment.  Maybe that will set the witnesses off or drive them crazy but they might answer some of those questions.  They are points of discussion as opposed to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019070200002#D00300","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>On the first part of the Senator's question on who is listening, the people are listening.  If we look at our members, our branches and the wider community, people are listening, they are seeing what is happening to the natural environment and they are concerned.<\/p> <p>  If the Senator recalls, we worked on a campaign against the Heritage Bill 2016 for a couple of years and 35,000 people signed a petition saying \"No\" to that legislation.  This was before the green wave started and to me, that was an indication that there was a group of people out there who are really concerned about the environment.  Those people are tapping into the likes of BirdWatch Ireland and other environmental non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and seeing what we are doing.  They are the people who are really listening.  More and more, information is being fed up through the political system and politicians are hearing on their doorsteps more that nature is important to the people.  We have seen that with the declaration of the climate emergency in the D&aacute;il on 9 May.  While it could be seen by some that it is easy to just say this and it might be asked what will happen next, it is an important acknowledgement of where we are and it is something for us to build on and to keep bringing back to the Oireachtas committees and in our other representations.<\/p> <p>  I was disappointed that part of the declaration of the emergency was the call for the Citizens' Assembly to address the issue of biodiversity loss.  That was not taken up in the round of citizens' assemblies that was announced by the Government about two weeks ago.<\/p><p>That was disappointing to say the least.  We have written to the Taoiseach and others to remind them that they have said in the D&aacute;il that this is going to happen but it is not on the list, and to ask them when it will happen. <\/p><p> We hope to see that happen because it is very important to channel this insight and the care that many people in Ireland have for the natural environment into a conversation that would put some structure on how Government responds.  The Senator is right that BirdWatch Ireland should be speaking at more committee meetings.  It has to seep into everybody's conversation.  The convoluted sentence about policy coherence the Senator mentioned means that we could convey that when new buildings are being built, there would be swift blocks.  Birds use buildings and we need to think about how we can get swift bricks into new buildings.  We need to think about the impact it will have if a building is planned to go beside the special protection area for birds and that it may not be a great idea.  It is to have a thinking process before the planning process.  That could expand into agriculture and other areas.<\/p><p> There are people listening and the Government is starting to listen.  There have been significant efforts to help with biodiversity loss; just not enough.  The problem is that sometimes the left hand is doing one thing and the right hand does not know what is going on and there is policy incoherence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019070200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>What does BirdWatch Ireland think of the idea of a Department of natural environment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019070200002#E00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>It would be very important to move that forward.

Only by creating a Department dedicated to protection of the environment will we do that.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service does an excellent job but it is a tiny section in a large Department and it does not have a voice.  It is important that the natural environment is given a greater voice within the Government.  For some species there are very stark choices, particularly in respect of intensive agriculture.  We cannot have intensive agriculture and retain some of these farmland species that are important to us, such as curlew, lapwing, corncrake etc.  There must be a much greater recognition of that if we value these species.  While we value farmers and everything they do and the importance of that industry, the farmland birds and the biodiversity associated with farmland is fast disappearing.  To tackle that we need a Department that is much stronger and able to engage at a much higher level with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

There are some good options for that in GLAS but there is not nearly enough guidance for farmers.  Farmland birds sometimes have quite complex requirements and through testing of the various schemes undertaken, we have seen that the provision of specialist advice to farmers can greatly increase the results from these schemes in terms of biodiversity.  The biodiversity return is far higher where the farmer has access to specialist ecological advice.<\/p> <p>  Another point would be longer-term management agreements.  This could be difficult to implement in respect of the CAP cycles we are dealing with now.  Most agri-environment schemes last for five years.  If that is compared with the forestry scheme where the returns on investment are far longer term, that is an option that farmers sometimes take because of the long-term security compared with GLAS, which offers a much shorter return.  Very often, to implement change at the farm level that will really have a positive impact on biodiversity it is necessary to have much longer-term agreements because it can take many years to reverse some of the damage done as a result of the intensification of agriculture.  Longer-term agreements, landscape scale agreements, co-operative payments for farmers who are working together to deliver biodiversity at the landscape scale would also be very important, as would the new eco-scheme that is being talked about as part of the next CAP agreement.  Some actions need to be undertaken by all farmers because some will reduce nutrient levels.  The burden cannot just fall on a few farmers to implement those actions.  All farmers, even the most intensive ones have contributions that they can and should make to get what is essentially public money. <\/p> <p>  We have engaged through the curlew task force with the forestry division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on guidelines for assessing applications for forestry.  Some good work has been done in the Department, for example, the forestry division has introduced new guidelines to protect curlew sites but that is the only action.

We met with the Irish forest service a few weeks ago to discuss some elements of that report with it.  We would like to see some of the things in it happen, such as better ecological assessment of forestry plantations going into farmland that is not at a tourist site or a special area of conservation.  A survey could be done to identify whether it was an important species-rich grassland that needed to be saved, and whether there were ground nesting birds other than curlew there.<\/p><p>Then we get a good baseline and can make a decision on whether it is worth putting trees on it.  We are losing semi-natural grasslands in this manner that are high nature value.  Recently, Teagasc published a high nature value farmland map that has a finer resolution.  We will be able to see where it is documenting these sites.<\/p><p> There is a push for increases in broadleaf trees in the forest stock and what is planted.  Predominantly it is still non-native Sitka spruce type of forestry, which is not great in many respects.  We would like to see a lot more native woodland, with the right trees in the right places with the right management and continuous cover forestry, not forestry that will just be clear felled.  There would probably be a lot more community buy-in with that type of forestry.  Community-led woodlands would be a really good idea.  The Senator asked about the Leitrim report and the review.  BirdWatch Ireland was interviewed as part of that and we await the outcome of the report.  It was just for Leitrim.

The Wildlife Act has provisions to allow for hedge cutting for road safety reasons and this is really important.  We are all road users and we need to use the road safely.  This is important to keep in mind.  When we communicate with people and discuss this we ask whether people are aware of the provisions in the Wildlife Act.

It is a hugely important review of where we are in this country.  As Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said, our bird populations are the canary in the mine where our wider environmental challenges are concerned.  This indicator screams that there is a huge problem in our sea areas, forests, wetlands, urban areas and farmland.  A bleak but very important picture has been portrayed here today.  I thank the witnesses for coming in and providing it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how we can turn this around, I was watching earlier questions on the monitor.  The response to climate change has to be co-ordinated with the response to the biodiversity crisis.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action has highlighted the restoration of wetlands as a means by which we could store carbon.  A reduction in the use of pesticides, a return in the insect population, whose decline is one of the hazards the witnesses mentioned, and the resulting increase in soil fertility would also improve the carbon storage capabilities of that farmland.  Greater diversity in farming is another measure that the Joint Committee on Climate Action has recommended, because over-reliance on monocultural beef and dairy production at scale is a high-risk farming strategy at this point.  They are just two examples.  The use of marine protected areas could also have benefits in restoring more natural ecosystems to our sea areas.

We can all play our part, as the Deputy notes, through things like putting up nest boxes, particularly for species that need them most such as swifts, which are on the amber lists, spotted flycatchers and other species that are in decline.

This, from the ground up, has a significant impact because one of the things we see with regard to our bird populations is a tremendous shift to the north west with regard to some species, especially those that come from south of the Sahara to migrate here such as swallows, swifts, cuckoos, martins and warblers, which we think is very much driven by climate change.

When habitat loss has been severe enough to cause populations to become extinct in the first place, it would be madness to attempt reintroductions to those landscapes, which are very poor and which will not be able to support them.  The landscape must be restored before we look at bringing the birds back.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned Bord na M&oacute;na.  We have quite a close working relationship with the latter, particularly in the context of curlew populations.  Its land holdings support just under a fifth of the national curlew population.

I have a few points or questions.  In looking around the country the biggest change one sees is that, while there is uniformity in that all areas have changed, there are different changes in different areas.  In areas being farmed very intensively, farming and land-use methods are very aggressive.  There are high levels of monocultural production of whatever is being farmed, which is grass and grazing animals in most cases.  In certain areas, one sees big large swathes of tillage.  It is quite interesting that in the west of Ireland it is not a question of the intensification of farming; the opposite seems to be the biggest change.  What are the big changes I see when I drive around?  The first is that a great deal of land is not being farmed at all.  It has actually gone wild with bushes, scrub and whatever.  The second is that farming is totally monocultural.  Where any farming is taking place, it is purely for the purpose of growing grass.<\/p><p>Even 30 years ago, many farmers sowed a few acres of oats or some other crop.  They grew vegetables, potatoes or whatever, so they were tilling the soil.  How have the changes in farming practices, which are not all towards intensification, affected bird populations of different types?  Have some been affected more than others?<\/p><p> That leads to my second question.  I note the reference in the document I have before me to GLAS.  If we were to try to recreate a more mixed approach to farming, especially in monoculture areas, with a little tillage or whatever and by significant grants under an environmental scheme, would that help to recreate the diversity of the past?  If I understand what our guests from BirdWatch Ireland are saying, whatever was happening gave rise to far more diversity than is the case now.  If much of that is down to farming habits, then we have to look at how they have changed.  It has not all moved towards intensification.  Some has changed in exactly the opposite direction towards de-intensification and monocultural farming.  We have gone from intensive farming with every parcel of land being used in a multipurpose fashion down to half the land going wild and the other half with only grass.  As part of a prospective scheme, could there be something to encourage a little tillage in order that people might grow vegetables, potatoes and so on?  Does BirdWatch Ireland believe that would have an impact?  Would it create something akin to what we had in farming practices going back 50, 60 or 70 years?<\/p><p> Obviously, some birds are vulnerable in areas where farmers are going right into the hedges in a way they could not do before the introduction of the mechanisation relating to intensification.  Does BirdWatch Ireland have suggestions for how that issue could be dealt with and how farmers could be incentivised?  There were meant to be nature areas, I understand, for tillage, but I wonder how that worked.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the curlew.  I think I mentioned this to the BirdWatch Ireland deputation previously.  Where I live there would have been curlews nesting on the islands and lakes.  I am told one of the problems we face is mink, because mink can swim while foxes cannot.  We never find foxes on an island.  How have species introduced to the wild affected native populations of birds, especially those that nest in the grass and those vulnerable to animals such as mink and animals of prey that go to places where other animals cannot go?  From what I hear on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, on islands such as Inisbofin, Inishturk and so on the corncrake appears to have mounted something of a comeback.  I know good programmes have assisted that.  Where do the numbers stand as regards the corncrake?  Have we analysed the cause?  One of the questions was about the actions taken that have had a positive effect.  I was told, either correctly or incorrectly, that there are reasons for the demise of the corncrake in places where there is no problem of over-mechanical harvesting where the corncrake would have been.  It was not simply mechanical harvesting because that was not the problem on uninhabited islands but, apparently, it was the lack of farming and the lack of any activity.  This goes back to my first point.  The humans created circumstances for some of these birds that were friendly to them.  The interaction between humans acting in certain traditional ways and the birds created what we had in the 19th century and the early 20th.  How much do we have to positively recreate that?  Letting the place go wild is not the simple answer to getting some of these birds back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019070200002#J00800","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I will go back to the beginning when the Deputy made a couple of points about the changes in the west and north west, where we have marginal areas that have effectively been abandoned and farming does not happen there any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019070200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anita Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1562022000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>The point is that wherever farming is done, it is pure cattle and sheep.

We discussed the loss of mixed farming and the fact that farms would all have been lower-intensity and more diverse in the past.  Everyone would have had a little patch of oats and there would have been some grazing.  That mixture allowed for an environment rich in wildlife.  Inputs were far lower and management was far more sympathetic to wildlife.  Hay meadows were cut late and there were no multiple cults of silage, for example.  All of those things would have been important in producing an environment rich in wildlife.  Gradually, different elements of mixed farms have been lost.  The loss of our small patches of arable land has been significant for species such as the yellowhammer, the skylark and the corn bunting.  One reason we have lost the corn bunting is the loss of mixed farming.  The vast majority of yellowhammers now are in the east, where the larger more intense arable farms are found.  It has definitely been significant.<\/p> <p>  The abandonment of farming is a reflection of the lack of supports for low-intensity beef and sheep farming.  The money is to be made in dairy, as committee members know.  There is not enough support for low-intensity beef farming.  Yet, that is the kind of farming that supports the curlew and some of the other farming birds.  If we are really serious about retaining these farming birds, then we need to give more supports to farmers who have far lower-intensity farming systems that are friendlier to wildlife.  There is no doubt about that.  My colleagues may want to add something on that issue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to mink.  We are sure mink are having a serious impact on a wide range of ground-nesting birds, but it is not only mink.  Mink have been reintroduced.  They are a non-native species but some of our native species are equally devastating, including foxes, otters and pine martens.  All these species are having a severe impact on ground-nesting birds like the curlew or the lapwing.  These birds are declining rapidly and we are really concerned.  We have to address these issues by tacking predation and controlling some of these species.  Some of our members do not like it, but in a way we have to take measures to protect species on the verge of extinction.  Under a European innovation programme that we are running with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in south Lough Corrib in Galway, we are working with farmers to train them in techniques to control these predators.  This is an area where there are vulnerable populations of ground-nesting birds.  It does not arise everywhere; it is only in a small number of key hotspots where this needs to be done.  We are not shirking that issue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the corncrake.  The number of corncrake we have comes to approximately 150 pairs.  It has been 20 years since corncrake conservation programmes was initiated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.  Then the National Parks and Wildlife Service took it over.  The population has fluctuated up and down but it has not really changed all that much.  There has not been wide-scale recovery of corncrake populations.  They are becoming more and more marginalised and confined the islands mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We find that the numbers on the mainland are going to continue to go down.  They are still found on islands where there is still some low-intensity farming but they are also found on islands where the farming has more or less disappeared.  We really know what needs to be done.<\/p><p>It is not a particularly complex problem.  We know what needs to be done to allow corncrake populations to recover and increase.  There are not enough resources being put in to do it.  That is the bottom line.  Perhaps my colleagues might wish to add something to these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019070200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anita Donaghy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1562022000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>On Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv's question on intensive farms needing to do their bit, I want to let him know about a project in Cork, which is the Biodiversity Regeneration In a Dairying Environment, BRIDE, project, where Donal Sheehan and other farmers in the Bride Valley with intensive dairy, beef and other farms are trying to set aside up to 10% of their intensive land in order to help biodiversity.

It would also reward the farmers because they cannot live on scenery.  Reward the farmers and make it profitable for them to stay in business and do a type of farming that maximises the protection of nature, which is not a non-farming practice and which is where we are heading.  It is a type of farming that is compatible with good nature projects.  GLAS and the agri-environment options scheme are too confined when it comes to dealing with environmental issues and do not really reward for positive action.  Putting it at its simplest, the easiest way to get money under those schemes is to do very little because one will not be penalised and will be much less vulnerable to penalties.

Mar sin, an t-aon ph&iacute;osa den jigsaw at&aacute; in easnamh n&aacute; Gaelchol&aacute;iste iarbhunscoile, agus sin an feachtas at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l againn faoi l&aacute;thair.<\/p><p> T&aacute; an t-&aacute;dh orainn go bhfuil foirgneamh an CDETB ann cheana f&eacute;in.

Cr&iacute;ochna&iacute;odh an foirgneamh nua sin agus bhog an Ghaelscoil amach as i m&iacute; an Mheithimh.  Mar sin, t&aacute; foirgneamh folamh ann agus t&aacute; an CDETB l&aacute;n taobh thiar d&uacute;inn.  T&aacute; an CDETB ar t&iacute; c&aacute;s a chur le ch&eacute;ile faoi l&aacute;thair chun buis&eacute;ad m&uacute;inteoireachta a fhiafra&iacute; ar an Roinn Oideachas agus Scileanna.  N&iacute; buis&eacute;ad m&oacute;r at&aacute; i gceist mar go bhfuil an foirgneamh ann agus &eacute; r&eacute;idh le haghaidh p&aacute;ist&iacute; dul isteach ann cheana f&eacute;in.<\/p><p> Fuair muid freagra iontach &oacute; thuismitheoir&iacute; sa cheantar &oacute; thaobh Ghaelchol&aacute;iste de.

Chomh maith leis sin, m&aacute; fhaighimid an scoil seo, agus m&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; i mbliana mar at&aacute; s&uacute;il againn, t&aacute; gealltanas tugtha ag Comhairle Cathrach Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath ina phlean &aacute;iti&uacute;il go n-oibreoidh s&eacute; leis an Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta chun st&aacute;das Gaeltacht &aacute;iti&uacute;il a bhaint amach i mBaile Munna.

Bh&iacute; siad ag lorg scoil a bheadh bainteach leo, agus chuir siad amach tender do scoil a bheadh s&aacute;sta a bheith ina aonad.  Th&aacute;inig mn&aacute; rialta acu &oacute; Mercy College, scoil cail&iacute;n&iacute;, agus d&uacute;irt siad go raibh c&uacute;pla rang folamh acu, agus go bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s tos&uacute; ansin.

T&aacute; c&uacute;pla tuairim agam f&eacute;in faoi sin.  D'fh&aacute;s m&eacute; suas mar ph&aacute;iste i mBaile Munna tr&iacute; na 1970&iacute; agus na 1980&iacute;.  Sula raibh aon Ghaelscoil ann i mBaile Munna chuaigh m&eacute; suas go dt&iacute; an s&eacute;&uacute; rang sa ghn&aacute;thbhunscoil &aacute;iti&uacute;il.  N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; in ann tr&iacute; fhocal a chur le ch&eacute;ile as Gaeilge, seachas c&uacute;pla abairt foghlamtha n&aacute;r thuig m&eacute; iad i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Nuair a thosaigh m'athair, Antain, feachtas i gcomhair Gaelscoile i dteannta le tuismitheoir&iacute; eile, a bhfuil roinnt acu ar an gcoiste faoi l&aacute;thair na huaire, chuir s&eacute; ceist orm ar mhaith liom athr&uacute; go Gaelscoil?  Bh&iacute; orm taistil &oacute; Bhaile Munna go dt&iacute; an chathair chun dul go dt&iacute; Gaelscoil Cholmcille.  I gceann dh&aacute; mh&iacute; bh&iacute; m&eacute; in ann caint as Gaeilge, c&eacute; nach raibh Gaeilge iontach agam.  T&eacute;ann duine at&aacute; ag foghlaim na Gaeilge tr&iacute; ch&eacute;imeanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  Is &eacute; an tsl&iacute; ina nd&eacute;anann a leith&eacute;id de dhuine Gaeilge a fhoghlaim n&aacute; cloiseann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; ceist as Gaeilge, d&eacute;anann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; a dh&iacute;cheall &iacute; a aistri&uacute; go B&eacute;arla, d&eacute;anann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; freagra as B&eacute;arla ina intinn, agus d&eacute;anann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; a dh&iacute;cheall an freagra sin a aistri&uacute; go Gaeilge.  Le cleachtadh, tagann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; go dt&iacute; an pointe gur f&eacute;idir leis n&oacute; l&eacute;i ceist a chloiste&aacute;il mar cheist seachas mar rud go gcaithfear aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh air.  T&eacute;ann an cheist san intinn mar cheist agus freagra&iacute;tear &eacute; d&iacute;reach &oacute;n intinn.  Sin an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im i dtreo l&iacute;ofachta.<br\/><br\/>D'fhiafraigh an Seanad&oacute;ir c&aacute;rbh as ar th&aacute;inig an spiorad.  Ag an am sin n&iacute; raibh Baile Munna ach s&eacute; bliana d'aois n&oacute; mar sin, c&eacute; gur baile n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; Port L&aacute;irge &iacute; &oacute; thaobh daonra.  Th&aacute;inig an chuid is m&oacute; de na daoine sin &oacute; l&aacute;r na cathrach.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil an ceart agam leis sin.  Is saghas tuairim fheals&uacute;nach &iacute;, ach smaoin&iacute;m go raibh ceangal i bhfad n&iacute;os doimhne ag na daoine sin le heachtra&iacute; sheachtain na C&aacute;sca 1916 de bharr gur th&aacute;inig an tromlach d&oacute;ibh &oacute; l&aacute;r na cathrach, &oacute; na tenements agus mar sin de.  Bh&iacute; ceangal n&iacute;os doimhne acu le haidhmeanna poblacht&aacute;naigh agus t&aacute; a fhios ag gach duine gur cheann d'aidhmeanna bhunaitheoir&iacute; &aacute;r St&aacute;t n&aacute; &eacute; a bheith, i bhfocail an Phiarsaigh, &quot;N&iacute; amh&aacute;in saor, ach Gaelach chomh maith; n&iacute; amh&aacute;in Gaelach, ach saor chomh maith&quot;.  Sin an f&aacute;th, nuair a phlean&aacute;ladh Baile Munna agus nuair a th&oacute;gadh na seacht dt&uacute;r, gur cuireadh ainmneacha sh&iacute;nitheoir&iacute; fhor&oacute;gra na Poblachta orthu: Pearse, Ceannt, Plunkett, MacDermott agus araile.  Is as sin a th&aacute;inig ainm na scoile, Scoil an tSeachtar Laoch.  Is iad an seachtar laoch na seacht duine a sh&iacute;nigh an for&oacute;gra.<br\/><br\/>Nuair a thosaigh an ch&eacute;ad choiste ag r&aacute; go raibh Gaelscoil ag teast&aacute;il agus nuair a bhunaigh s&eacute; an feachtas, chuir s&eacute; glaoch amach agus th&aacute;inig laochra, cairde iontacha, chuige.  Bh&iacute; &oacute;c&aacute;id f&iacute;ormh&oacute;r i mBaile Munna.  Bh&iacute; Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riada tar &eacute;is b&aacute;s a fh&aacute;il ag an bpointe seo ach th&aacute;inig a bhean ch&eacute;ile.  Chaith s&iacute; l&aacute; ann.  Bh&iacute; gr&uacute;pa &oacute; Ch&uacute;il Aodha i gCorcaigh ann.  Chaith siad am linn.  Chuir s&eacute; sin leis an spiorad.  Bh&iacute; tionchar f&iacute;ormh&oacute;r acu ar na daoine a bh&iacute; ann ag an am.  Th&aacute;inig iriseoir &oacute;n nuacht&aacute;n <i>L&aacute;<\/i>, Colm &Oacute; Torna, amach chun ranganna Gaeilge leis na tuismitheoir&iacute; nach raibh aon Ghaeilge acu in aon chor.  Ba Ghaeilge shimpl&iacute; agus comhr&aacute;ite a bh&iacute; i gceist.  Lean s&eacute; ar aghaidh.<br\/><br\/>Is rud eile f&iacute;ormh&oacute;r chomh maith n&aacute;, de bharr gur &aacute;it bhocht ina raibh a l&aacute;n d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ochta &eacute;, go raibh an preas di&uacute;ltach faoi i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  N&iacute; cloiseadh aon sc&eacute;al ag teacht &oacute; Bhaile Munna ach sc&eacute;alta faoi dhaoine ag briseadh an dl&iacute;, druga&iacute;, daoine d&iacute;fhostaithe, troideanna agus araile.  B'annamh a cloiseadh sc&eacute;al dearfach faoi.  Nuair a thosaigh &eacute; seo agus nuair a thosaigh sc&eacute;alta dearfacha ag teacht as an &aacute;it, c&eacute; go raibh siad beag, bh&iacute; tionchar an-mh&oacute;r aige ar dhaoine i mBaile Munna.  Mar dhuine a bh&iacute; ina bhuachaill deich mbliana d'aois i mBaile Munna sna 1970&iacute;, t&aacute; a fhios agam gur chuir an meon sin isteach go m&oacute;r ar fh&eacute;inmhuin&iacute;n daoine sa cheantar.  N&iacute; paranoia amh&aacute;in &eacute;.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or.  B'fh&eacute;idir le duine cur isteach i gcomhair post agus ardteistim&eacute;ireacht mhaith aige n&oacute; aici, ach chomh luath agus a chonaic fost&oacute;ir gurbh as Baile Munna a th&aacute;inig s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute;, chonacthas air n&oacute; uirthi mar chuid de lucht lofa Bhaile Munna.
