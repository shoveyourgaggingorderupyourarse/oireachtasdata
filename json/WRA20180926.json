The consultation process was lengthy, thorough and inclusive and included regional seminars, a national conference, and consultation meetings with sectorial interests as well as the written submissions.  This consultation informed the development of the 2010 National Pensions Framework which included the policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) for the State Pension Contributory and auto-enrolment for supplementary pensions.  This policy was endorsed by a subsequent review of the Irish Pensions System published by the OECD in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 is not another discussion paper - it is focused on implementing polices that have already been well debated and have broad support.  In particular that the State pension will be reformed in line with the TCA recommended in the National Pensions Framework and that a system of auto-enrolment will be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  I launched the public consultation on the design of the TCA on the 28th of May to which interest groups including pensioners, workers, employers, young people, the unemployed, etc. were invited.

Among the key commitments contained in this plan is to develop, by 2022, a new &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; (AE) supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage. <\/p>  <p>  AE will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the well-being, financial security and independence of future retirees. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the actions contained in the Roadmap to achieve this ambitious commitment, a full time &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office&rsquo; (PMO) is now operational within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The PMO is undertaking the work required to establish the evidence base which will inform future Government decisions regarding the design of the system.  In addition, a new Interdepartmental &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Board&rsquo; has also been established to provide strategic direction to the project and ensure that operational arrangements are in place to allow first enrolments no later than 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, I published a &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal for an AE supplementary retirement savings system and commenced a public consultation process.  The &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal is a high level draft proposal designed to prompt and generate discussion and improve ideas.  It should not, in any way, be construed as Government&rsquo;s confirmation of what form AE will ultimately take.  The goal of publishing the 'Strawman' is to help interested parties conceptualise plausible approaches to AE and to facilitate a focused debate around key design issues and how to address income adequacy for retirees in the future.   My intention is to allow individuals and interest groups an opportunity to submit their views on the design and operational structure of the AE system. <\/p>  <p>  The closing date for formal written submissions to the Strawman consultation process is the 4th November.  In addition to this a number of AE member focus groups will be arranged; my Department is also holding a number of regional consultation fora in Dublin, Galway and Cork during October; and officials of my Department are holding a briefing session today for members of these Houses and their staff.

The Government has provided &euro;49.5 million for the scheme in 2018. <\/p><p>The payment rates are &euro;125 for eligible children aged 4 to 11 years and &euro;250 for children aged over 12 years and attending secondary school. <\/p><p>Since 2010, in excess of 100,000 customers can be identified every year from the Department's computer system as having an automatic entitlement to the allowance. These customers are notified of their entitlement and there is no requirement for them to make an application. In addition, approximately 55,000 customers may have an entitlement but need to apply to have this entitlement assessed. <\/p><p>Similar to arrangements in previous years, the majority of this year&rsquo;s BSCFA payments for 104,461 families in respect of approximately 190,308 children were fully automated and parents were not required to make an application to the Department.  The total amount paid to families with an automatic entitlement was &euro;33.45m and these payments were made during the week commencing 9<sup>th<\/sup>July 2018.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for an automated payment the parent of the child must have been in receipt of a qualifying payment that included an increase in respect of a qualified child at the commencement of the scheme and the Department were satisfied that the household satisfied the means test for the scheme. The scheme commenced from the 1<sup>st<\/sup>June 2018 with the entitlement created based on the preceding week's entitlement.<\/p><p>The  back to school clothing and footwear allowance is a mean-tested allowance. Qualifying for the allowance in a previous year does not in any way guarantee the customer will receive it in the current year and many customers, especially those who have had a change in their means or circumstance, will need to make an application for the payment for this year in order to have their entitlement validated.  Customers with children aged 18 years or over will also need to apply and provide confirmation that the children are in full-time second-level education.  Therefore, it is not possible, prior to the release of the automatic payments, to inform customers that they have no automatic entitlement to the payment.<\/p><p>Customers who may have received BSCFA in previous years and did not receive written confirmation of entitlement for this year by end June will need to make an application.

All applications received up to 4th September 2018 have been processed.  The delays have arisen as a result of a combination of initial technical issues, which have now been resolved, and a very high volume of new applications received since the beginning of July.

However, reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2016 shows that being at work reduces the consistent poverty rate for lone parents by nearly two-thirds.

At a cross-governmental level, the focus is on assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.  All of these services are crucial to assisting lone parents into employment, and to lifting both them and their children out of poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that lone parents face challenges that two-parent families do not face.  On this basis, I introduced increases to the income disregard for lone parents in Budget 2018, alongside other measures, including the primary rate and the increase for a qualified child, which have assisted lone parents.

Penalty rate sanctions can only be invoked in relation to failure to comply with the Department&rsquo;s activation measures. Activation measures include the requirement to attend group or individual meetings, and\/or avail of suitable education, training or development opportunities, or specified employment programmes, which are considered appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Social Welfare legislation provides that sanctions\/penalties in the form of reduced payments may be imposed by a Deciding Officer of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, where jobseekers referred for activation fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures.

An increased payment can be made where full-time care is being provided to two people. <\/p><p>Carer's benefit (CARB) is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for a child or an adult in need of full-time care and attention. <\/p><p>At the end of August 2018 the average waiting time for new CA application was 18 weeks while it was 11 weeks for a new CARB application. <\/p><p>Before a decision can be made on entitlement carers allowance, evidence must be provided to establish whether the person being cared for has such a disability that they require full-time care and attention, whether the carer is providing full-time care and attention, whether the carer is habitually resident in the State and, finally, whether the carer satisfies the means test. <\/p><p>To qualify for carers benefit a person has to show that they have the required level of PRSI contributions, that they have left full-time employment, that they are providing full-time care and attention and that the person being cared for has such a disability that they require full-time care and attention. <\/p><p>In general, social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.

However, given the case was taken in the context of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), my officials examined the ruling to see if the reasoning in the ruling might have applicability for the WCP, which is paid to over 120,000 widows, widowers and surviving civil partners each week.<\/p>  <p>  The ruling explicitly recognised that such payments may be based on marital status, under the ECHR.  Paragraph 25 of the judgement referenced the previous Shackell v United Kingdom (2000) case where the European Court of Human Rights &ldquo;declared inadmissible a complaint that denying widow&rsquo;s benefits to unmarried surviving partners discriminated against the survivor and her children on the ground of her unmarried status and the children&rsquo;s illegitimacy&rdquo;.  The award of benefits to couples who have entered marriage is a feature of most European countries, both within the benefits system and the tax code, and is in compliance with the ECHR.<\/p>  <p>  The basis of the UKSC ruling against the UK Government in this case was that the WPA was primarily an allowance to support the weekly costs of dependant children, and not the living costs of the parent.  Paragraph 27 of the ruling noted that WPA \"is only paid because the survivor is responsible for the care of children who were at the date of death the responsibility of one or both of them.  Its purpose must be to benefit the children.&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  This is in contrast to the provisions of the WCP in Ireland, which is paid to widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, regardless of whether or not they have children.<\/p>  <p>  WCP is paid to the husband, wife or civil partner of a deceased person, and is a weekly pension, available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or on that of the deceased spouse, provided the applicant is not cohabiting.  <\/p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is regulated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties which do not exist in law between co-habiting couples.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, lose someone who had legal duties towards them, and the social welfare code recognises this by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  It was for these reasons that the social welfare supports for widows and widowers were extended to surviving civil partners from 1 January 2011, when the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 came into force.<\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600071#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600071#WRC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[38769\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600071#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the consultations that have taken place on the proposed auto enrolment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>Pensions reform is a Government priority and the plans to achieve this are set out in the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023, which was published last February.

This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer too high a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the well-being, financial security and independence of future retirees. <\/p>  <p>  Thus far, consultations have taken place to utilise expertise and facilitate input from, and engagement with, the various sectorial interests including those from the pensions industry, representatives of small, large and multinational employers, trade unions and consumer\/advocate group representatives.  This involved issuing a briefing document and an &lsquo;Invitation for Submissions&rsquo; to approximately 35 industry\/employer\/trade union\/consumer\/advocate representative groups.  All groups  were afforded the opportunity for a follow on meeting to expand further on views advanced in written submissions. <\/p>  <p>  Consultations have also taken place with a range of international\/Irish subject matter experts to inform the deliberative process.  This includes experts from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  Using the learning achieved from this work, last month, I published a &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal for an AE supplementary retirement savings system and commenced a wider national public consultation process.  The &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal is a high level draft proposal designed to prompt and generate discussion and improve ideas.  It should not be construed as Government&rsquo;s confirmation of what form AE will ultimately take.

In addition, a number of other measures are being arranged including a briefing for Oireachtas members - which is being held today; dedicated &lsquo;AE member Focus Groups&rsquo;; and regional public consultation fora in Dublin, Galway and Cork during the month of October.

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. <\/p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2019, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 30,000, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 30,000 such grants made in 2019, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be approx. &euro;25.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.

In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.

More recently, the Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to providing for incremental adjustments which do not impact negatively on jobs or competitiveness.  The Commission thus takes an evidence-based approach to its recommendations, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations to date have been accepted by Government, resulting in an increase in the National Minimum Wage between January 2016 and January 2018 of over 10% (from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.55 per hour).  The Commission&rsquo;s most recent report was published in July 2018, recommending a further increase to &euro;9.80 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  A decision by Government in relation to this recommendation will be announced in the context of Budget 2019, and a resulting increase in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 would be effective from 1 January 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent figures published by Eurostat (August 2018) show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,614 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).  Allowing for purchasing power standards, Ireland drops to sixth place, but still remains in the group with the highest minimum wage rates in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  As a voluntary initiative, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement.  The National Minimum Wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers. <\/p>  <p>  I currently have no plans to bring forward proposals regarding the Living Wage outside of the legislative based work of the Low Pay Commission.  The setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and Government does not interfere unduly in the process.  More generally, this area comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through her Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for industrial relations issues generally and wage-setting mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) and Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600072#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600073#WRE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600073#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[39023\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600073#WRE00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the informal Heads of Government summit in Salzburg and, in particular, his meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May.","asker":"1336","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>I attended the Informal Summit in Salzburg on 19 \/ 20 September where I met with my EU counterparts.

EU Leaders at the Summit reaffirmed their full support for Michel Barnier in his negotiations, including his efforts to &lsquo;de-dramatise&rsquo; the backstop. Subsequently, on 21 September Prime Minister May stated that the UK would bring forward its own proposals on the backstop. The Government welcomes this initiative, and would urge that this is done as a matter of urgency, so that the negotiating teams can engage constructively on finalising the legal text of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. The EU is of course willing to consider these proposals once tabled by the UK but has been clear that outcome must be fully consistent with the agreement reached in the Joint Progress Report of last December and the clear commitments and guarantees provided by the UK.    The October European Council meeting on 18 October remains the target to achieve maximum progress and results in the negotiations.  At that meeting, Ireland and our EU partners would then decide if conditions are sufficient to call an extraordinary summit in November to finalise and formalise the deal. Real progress on the backstop will be an essential part of that decision.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of these negotiations, the Government has been clear and consistent in our position that a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland must be avoided under any circumstances. A legally operable &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; which avoids a hard border and protects the integrity of the single market is essential for agreeing the Withdrawal Agreement, so as to provide the certainty that no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the future relationship, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Time is running short.

Nos. 119, 120, 122 and 123 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has developed the proposed flood relief scheme for Cork City following 11 years of detailed scientific and engineering study and design which has been carried out with the benefit of ongoing and regular public consultation with the general public and other key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The tender notice for the Main Engineering Consultancy contract on the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme was advertised on the Irish government&rsquo;s eTenders website and also on the Official Journal of the European Union, the European Public Procurement website, in September 2012. This was an Open Procedure and tenders were scored on a number of relevant criteria. As a result of this process, Arup Consulting Engineers scored the highest and were appointed as Main Design Engineers on the scheme in 2013. <\/p>  <p>  Over the course of the following four years, the design consultants, in conjunction with the scheme&rsquo;s environmental consultants, along with the Steering Group on the project with representatives of the OPW, Cork City Council, Cork County Council and the ESB considered and assessed all options to deal with the complex flooding from Inniscarra to Cork City. This process eventually identified a solution, which is the optimum and only technically viable flood relief scheme for Cork City.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was brought to formal public exhibition in December 2016 and, as part of the consultation process, a number of specific reports were produced and provided to the public on other alternative options which had been put forward but which were not viable solutions. Included in these reports was a very comprehensive report on the potential for a tidal barrier in Cork called &ldquo;Supplementary Report &ndash; Option of a Tidal Barrier&rdquo; which set out the costs of various possible tidal barriers at different locations. <\/p>  <p>  A local group opposed to the identified scheme commissioned a report by HR Wallingford to undertake a cost estimate only on a concept barrier at Little Island. This report estimated the cost of a tidal barrier at Little Island at &euro;165 million, including 25 years of operation and maintenance costs but noted that significant further study would be required to establish the required details of a suitable barrier and hence to provide an accurate cost estimate.  <\/p>  <p>  The detailed OPW report examined the Little Island barrier option as proposed by the local group opposed to the preferred scheme but the alignment, geometry, gate sizes etc. of this option were found to be unsuitable. The Little Island option was assessed in particular in Sections 5.4, 8 and 9 of the OPW report. An option to locate a tidal barrier at Great Island was considered the most technically suitable and this was costed at c. &euro;1bn in the OPW report.  <\/p>  <p>  The difference in cost estimates of the two reports can be explained by the fact that the OPW cost estimate includes the following costs which are not accounted for in the HR Wallingford cost estimate:<\/p>  <p>  - Cost of modifications to the barrier alignment, including additional lengths of barrier gates, required to address technical issues with the concept put forward by the stakeholder group<\/p>  <p>  - The cost of flood defences required to mitigate residual fluvial flood risk upstream of Cork City<\/p>  <p>  - The cost of measures required to mitigate a predicted flood bypass route around the north of Little Island<\/p>  <p>  - Uplift in contingency cost due to increased baseline construction costs<\/p>  <p>  - Uplift in operation &amp;amp; maintenance costs to allow for a 50 year maintenance duration, and due to increased baseline construction costs<\/p>  <p>  All works carried out by the OPW are subject to robust cost control procedures which are in full conformity with the requirements of the Public Spending Code. In the first instance an individual project budget is prepared at the beginning of each project, which is then monitored and adjusted as required during the different stages of Feasibility, Public Exhibition, Detailed Design etc. All major flood relief projects are subject to a rigorous Cost Benefit Analysis which is prepared in line with best international practice and updated at key stages of project development. The project budget is approved by the Board of Commissioners of Public Works before being submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for final statutory approval or Confirmation by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995. <\/p>  <p>  All public works contracts awarded by the OPW are procured through competitive tendering procedures to ensure best value for money and all procurement is carried out in full compliance with national and EU procurement rules. <\/p>  <p>  At project implementation stage, all costs are closely monitored by the project steering group to ensure that all potential significant cost variations are identified in a timely manner and all possible steps taken to address the underlying issues.

As detailed in the Report, the costs are annualised and an increment date of 1 January is assumed to give the full one year cost for over 60,500 staff identified as new entrants. However, increment dates across the year vary significantly by individual and sector while salary scales and the structure of such scales across the public service as they affect individuals is not consistent. The report also quantified the cost of a two point adjustment as approximately &euro;200m and the potential benefit to the individual as &euro;3,301 on average. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of this, since the publication of the report, my Department, in support of the discussions between the parties, has engaged in further work to assess and model the potential budgetary implications and impacts through phasing of the overall quantum. <\/p>  <p>  Discussions on the issue with public service trade unions and representative associations, commenced in October 2017, with a further plenary meeting taking place on 27th of April last following the publication of the report.<\/p>  <p>Agreement was reached, on Monday 24th September, between the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement on a measure which provides a pathway to addressing the concerns of those recruited to our public service since 2011 in a balanced and sustainable way.  It provides a fair and affordable path to managing the &euro;200m cost associated with the issue.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the agreement provides for two separate interventions which will take place at point 4 and point 8 of pay scales. The practical effect of this is that for &lsquo;new entrants&rsquo; the relevant points on the scale will be bypassed thereby reducing the time spent (by bypassing two increment points) on the scale for progression to the maximum point.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of this measure during the remaining term of the PSSA is &euro;75m (&euro;27m in 2019 and &euro;48m in 2020).  The full cost of the measure based on current data and public service numbers (2017) will cost &euro;190m out to 2026. It is estimated some 58% (35,750) of &lsquo;new entrants&rsquo; will benefit from this measure in year 1 rising to 78% (47,750) by year 2.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits under the measure will become effective from 1 March 2019, will be applied to each eligible new entrant as they reach the relevant scale points on their current increment date, and will be restricted to Parties adhering to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600073#WRE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600073#WRE06100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Schools","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600073#WRE06000"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[38922\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600073#WRE06100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the governance of a school (details supplied) is in accordance with Irish law in view of the fact that the school operates as two separate schools via the one legal entity; and if he is satisfied that the funds received by the school regulated by his Department are not being used for the benefit of the primary school which is part of the same limited company.","asker":"1306","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":185,"content":"<p>The post primary school St. Killian&rsquo;s Deutsche Schule, Roebuck Road, Clonskeagh Dublin 14 referred to by the Deputy is a Department recognised fee charging school which receives a staffing allocation from my Department in line with all other fee paying schools.<\/p>  <p>  As a post primary fee charging school St. Killian Deutsche Schule receives no capitation funding from my Department and operates on a pupil teacher ratio of 23:1 as opposed to 19:1 for all schools in the free education scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Teacher allocations for schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. <\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).<\/p>  <p>  The primary school referred to by the Deputy is a private fee charging primary school.

Additionally, we are one of a small number of Member States to extend labour market access to self-employment, to provide additional opportunities for applicants who wish to establish their own business. To date, I have granted\u00a01,388 labour market access permissions to eligible applicants. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of accommodation, the implementation of the Justice McMahon recommendations has improved the standard of living for many applicants across our centres, in particular for families. My colleague, Minister of State Stanton, has continued the programme of reforms in this area\u00a0through the establishment of a Standards Advisory Group. The Group, which includes representatives of relevant Government Departments, NGOs and representative groups, has developed Draft National Standards to\u00a0improve quality of care and ensure consistency across our accommodation centres. These Draft National Standards have been published on my Department's website as part of a consultation process with an opportunity to submit feedback via an online form. The consultation process opened on 16 August and the closing date for the submission of feedback was yesterday, 25 September. I would like to thank all those who took the time to review the Draft National Standards and to submit comments, which will feed into the finalised Standards. We are also holding consultation meetings with residents of the centres and with service providers, organisations and people working with residents. <\/p>  <p>  While both Minister Stanton and I are committed to\u00a0improving standards across accommodation centres, we must also acknowledge the exceptionally challenging environment for housing and accommodation\u00a0provision across the State at this time.

If they experience difficulties in reaching agreement on maintenance arrangements, they can try to work out a maintenance agreement through mediation.  The general objective of the Mediation Act 2017, which came into operation on 1 January, is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, including proceedings relating to maintenance of children, thereby reducing legal costs, speeding up the resolution of disputes and relieving the stress involved in court proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  Under Irish law, issues arising from disagreements about the provision of maintenance for dependent children, or failure by persons with maintenance responsibilities for children to provide proper maintenance, are determined by the courts.  Relevant legislation in this area includes section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, section 8 of the Family Law Act 1995, section 13 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 and section 45 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provided for a number of improvements in the law relating to maintenance of children.<\/p>  <p>  The law as it stands provides several mechanisms, including possible penalties, where a person fails to comply with court-ordered maintenance obligations. Section 10 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 enables a maintenance creditor to apply to the court for an order that maintenance be paid by way of attachment of earnings, so the maintenance due is deducted directly from income. A person can apply for an attachment of earnings order when applying to court for a maintenance order, if he or she is concerned that maintenance will not be paid, or he or she can apply later if the maintenance is not paid. <\/p>  <p>  The maintenance creditor may seek to recover sums owing through the courts by utilising the enforcement mechanisms available under section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 (as substituted by section 63 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011). In addition, where the failure to pay maintenance is as a result of unwillingness, as distinct from inability, to pay, under section 9A of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, the District Court has the power to regard a failure by a parent to comply with a court order relating to maintenance as contempt of court and to deal with it accordingly, including by means of imprisonment.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislative provisions relating to \"liable relatives\" and a person's liability to maintain his or her children which specifically apply in respect of the One-Parent Family Payment are contained in the Social Welfare Acts, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and not in the family law legislation to which I have referred above.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the review by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection of the maintenance and liable relative procedures, insofar as they relate to the One-Parent Family payment scheme, is nearing completion, and that the Department intends to liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality shortly with a view to jointly considering the next steps in relation to family maintenance arrangements.

In advance of this, on the 23rd January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been working on the various elements of this reform, which include\u00a0legislative change, operational changes and IT development.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department will be writing to impacted customers in the next two months to explain to them what is happening and how the process of review will work.\u00a0 As\u00a0I have stated\u00a0previously, it is still planned to commence these reviews before\u00a0the end\u00a0of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019, backdated, where relevant, to the end of March 2018, or later where a person attained their 66th birthday since that date. <\/p>  <p>  It is not necessary for people to contact the Department on this matter.\u00a0 Once the legislation is enacted and the systems and processes are ready, my Department will then write again to the people impacted and provide them with the opportunity to have their pension calculation reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  I should stress to the Deputy that this reform assists people, by helping them to qualify for a pension at a higher rate of payment, if they have the required contributions and\/or homecaring periods.\u00a0 The 2012 rateband changes did not disqualify anyone from qualifying for a pension.\u00a0 As\u00a0with the Yearly Average approach and the pre-existing homemakers disregard scheme, these new measures only determine the rate of payment for those with an entitlement to a State pension (contributory). They do not remove the requirement to be entitled to such a pension in the first place, based on criteria set out in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), but who are above State pension age, there are other state pension payments available. Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.

The DRHE is responsible for the planning, co-ordination and administration of funding in relation to the provision of quality services to people who are homeless in the Dublin area, and for the development of responses to prevent homelessness. The Executive works in partnership with a range of voluntary and statutory agencies and supports the Dublin Joint Homelessness Consultative Forum and Management Group.<\/p>  <p>  A dedicated Housing Delivery Office (HDO) was also established within my Department to support local authorities, approved housing bodies and all stakeholders involved in the delivery of key elements of the ambitious private and social housing targets in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan. The purpose of this office is to accelerate and monitor housing delivery, both private and social, on key sites, identify further mechanisms to accelerate delivery, and support the roll-out of complex construction projects, including identifying and resolving barriers to delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In order to drive transparency and accountability at local level for the delivery of social housing, I have published targets for local authorities for 2018, and also 2018-2021, and I am publishing output against these targets on a quarterly basis. These targets have been set with regard to need in each area (as established under the Summary Social Housing Assessment Process), and also delivery pipelines established and being advanced. My Department is working closely with all local authorities to drive delivery, particularly of new build homes, and to harness any available additional capacity, where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I believe what is critical at this stage is to ensure that all of the structures already in place are aligned, co-ordinated and co-operating towards a shared vision. This includes my own Department, the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency and the newly established Land Development Agency, working with local authorities and approved housing bodies across the country. While the scale of housing delivery continues to increase significantly, I have indicated to all local authorities that I am anxious to see even further acceleration of delivery.  I will continue to keep the relevant delivery arrangements under ongoing review, in consultation with key partners, particularly local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600079#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Approved Housing Bodies","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600079#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[39124\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600079#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if AHBs are charged development levies by local authorities for social housing new build units; and if so, the amount of levies paid into each local authority in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018, in tabular form.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>Development contributions are levied by planning authorities on the basis of development contribution schemes that are approved by the elected members of the relevant authority.\u00a0 These schemes set out the types of development to which contributions will apply, and the associated level of payment required, across each individual authority.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As development contribution schemes are determined at the individual planning authority level, in accordance with the powers vested in elected members, my Department&rsquo;s role is to provide the necessary legislative and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each authority. \u00a0In this regard, my Department has long-standing guidance in place that authorities should apply exemptions in respect of voluntary housing schemes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This objective is reflected in the various development contribution schemes whereby each authority has made provision to allow for a full\u00a0exemption from the payment of planning contributions in respect of social housing development that is carried out by voluntary or co-operative housing associations that are recognised by the relevant planning authority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600079#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600079#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[39126\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018092600079#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when he will bring forward the new tenant purchase scheme which incorporates the recommendations made in the review of the scheme recently introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>The Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.\u00a0 The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.
