Unfortunately, garda&iacute; in Sligo expressed their deep concern in late 2017 when they staged a protest about the conditions in which they must work.  The current building is more than 150 years old and there was no real surprise when an independent report raised fire safety issues along with health and safety concerns.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is aware of this situation and is doing all he can to advance the matter.  It must be remembered that there are a number of stakeholders involved in this intensive process.<\/p> <p>The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation nationally, including in Sligo, is being progressed by the Garda authorities, which work in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The Minister of State will be aware that a new site for the new Garda station in Sligo was acquired near Caltragh in May of last year.  There is a clear commitment in place to build a new station with the OPW through a public private partnership development.  The OPW confirmed last year that the development of the new station would be progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency.<\/p> <p>I commend all garda&iacute; in Sligo and throughout the State who are doing tremendous work every day on behalf of our communities.  I also acknowledge the Government's commitment to investing and strengthening the force.  Since the reopening in 2014 of the Garda College in Templemore 2,200 recruits have become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Garda numbers reached more than 14,000 at the end of 2018.<\/p> <p>In light of all this I hope garda&iacute; in Sligo get the modern Garda station they fully deserve in the near future.  The Sligo Garda station is a Garda regional headquarters and it is imperative that the new building project starts to make strides shortly.  As I said, there are a number of other Garda station projects planned in the State and each is worthy in its own right.  The projects take time and it can be a complex process.  Today, however, I am highlighting the need to progress the Sligo station project and to ensure that everything possible is being done to move it along.<\/p> <p>I commend the work of my colleague, Deputy McLoughlin, who has highlighted this matter on many occasions.

We also need educational programmes, of which the Minister of State is conscious, and areas of communication with respect to forestry.  I take this opportunity to thank Teagasc for its contribution.  I have attended a number of its workshops.  It runs Talking Timber programme events throughout the country, of which the Minister of State will be aware.  They are well advertised in the <i>Irish<\/i><i>Farmers' Journal <\/i>and the forestry sector.  People are putting on their boots and going on these walks, which is important.<br\/><br\/>In terms of knowledge transfer, many young farmers wish to consider putting a few hectares into forestry.  We need to consider that in the context of biodiversity and biomass.  There is a range of services related to forestry that would indirectly benefit everyone.  I mentioned energy and biomass.  The Government has spent billions of euro on forestry since the 1980s.  We must send out a strong message that we are interested in promoting sustainable forestry management, which is a major issue for many people.  There is much dispute about that in parts of the country with respect to the mix of broadleaf planting and the amenity aspect.  Coillte has bought into forestry providing added value in terms of an amenity.  I am aware the Minister of State was involved in such a scheme in the Dublin Mountains.<br\/><br\/>In terms of achieving these targets, has the Minister of State considered using Bord na M&oacute;na's estate of approximately 80,000 ha for forestry?  There are restoration issues related to remediation and rehabilitation works but that is an important aspect of realising those targets.<br\/><br\/>Has the Minister of State considered or will he reconsider the issue of work permits?  We hear reports of the forestry sector wanting to bring workers into the country, which may require an increase in the number of work permits.  We must deal with training, education, funding and grants.  If we want to reach these targets, it is important we incentivise farmers to get into forestry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#C00500","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to address the House and discuss the role of forestry in combating climate change as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2019.  There is a range of actions in the plan related to forestry.  These include measures to support afforestation and sustainable forest management.  They also include measures to raise awareness and manage risk to current carbon stocks and timber mobilisation.  The role of forests in combating the effects of climate change is well known.  Irish forests are excellent sources of carbon sequestration.  It is for this reason the State has invested almost &euro;3 billion since 1990, which has funded the planting of more than 300,000 ha of forestry.<\/p> <p>I will focus, however, on the Senator's specific query about increasing afforestation rates from their current levels to an average of 8,000 ha per year.  As outlined in the plan, we aim to achieve this through engaging with a range of landowners, from farmers to State bodies.  Specific measures will include generous grants and premiums for landowners to plant new forestry, the promotion of farm forestry, a new promotion and communication campaign, continued dialogue with stakeholders and engagement with Coillte and other State bodies, including Bord na M&oacute;na, to agree a planting programme.  We will also explore ways in which farm forestry can be better aligned and integrated with the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.<\/p> <p>One of the actions in the plan is to implement the forestry programme 2014-2020 in line with the mid-term review recommendations and targets set.  The implementation of the forestry programme, which offers a wide range of options and generous grants and annual premiums for landowners, continues to be a priority.  As matters stand, the current programme is averaging afforestation rates of 5,500 ha per annum or 75% of its overall target.  This will clearly need to be improved to meet the goals of the climate action plan.  Enhancements were made to the forestry programme in early 2018 as part of the mid-term review, including improved rates for planting new forests, particularly for broadleaves.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The promotion of afforestation will play an important role in our efforts to achieve our target.  We are committed to disseminating to as wide an audience as possible the message that forestry is good for the economy, the environment and the individual.  We recently granted support of &euro;830,000 to 15 innovative promotion projects that will run over the next two years.  Those efforts will be complemented by Teagasc's promotional activities and information days, as well as the Department's communication strategy.<\/p><p>My officials and I have ongoing engagement with stakeholders to ensure that the challenges are addressed as they arise and that we avail of opportunities to promote afforestation.  I have established a forestry implementation group and a forestry promotion group in order that we can work with relevant stakeholders on implementation and on ways to promote afforestation, respectively.  The Department also engages with Coillte to agree on a model whereby Coillte may contribute to afforestation rates to support the Government in its climate change mitigation effort.  The Senator referred to the establishment of Coillte Nature, which will convert and add native forests and woodlands to the area that Coillte manages.  It should be noted that the Department approves well in excess of 8,000 ha of land every year for afforestation but the conversion rate to planting stubbornly remains at approximately 60%.  This means that the forestry sector has at its disposal between 12,000 ha and 15,000 ha in approved and shovel ready trees that could be planted today.  The challenge is to ensure that all the effort that goes into securing and approving new sites results in those sites being planted, if the targets are to be met.  <\/p><p>An average of 8,000 ha per annum of newly planted forests represents a significant challenge but it can be met.

This land could also be used to increase the proportion of broadleaf forestry, helping us to meet our target of having broadleaf trees account for 30% of the trees planted annually.  Following the mid-term review, the proportion of broadleaf trees planted increased from 23% and the figure is expected to be approximately 28% for 2018.  While it is possible it will rise to 30% this year, it is too early to know, although the figures are encouraging.

The provision of such services is generally a matter for local authorities in accordance with the Local Government Act 2001.  This includes responsibility for managing day-to-day operations and staffing, providing services and programming to local communities and providing and maintaining library buildings.  Accordingly, the provision of library services in Mahon is a matter, first and foremost, for Cork City Council.  The latter currently supports ten public libraries in Cork city, including those in Ballincollig, Glanmire and Blarney, which joined the Cork city network in May following the Cork city and Cork county boundary revision.<\/p> <p>While Mahon was served by a mobile library until the vehicle was retired in November 2014, the area has never been served by a dedicated community library.  The nearest library to Mahon, which has a population of around 13,000, is in Douglas, just under 4 km away.  That said, I am aware that the provision of a library for the south-east ward, to serve the communities of Blackrock-Mahon, remains a priority for Cork City Council.  The council intends to develop a library similar to that opened in Hollyhill-Knocknaheeney in 2015.  However, finding a suitable site in the area has proven difficult.  Cork City Council has explored a number of possible locations for the new library, either as a stand-alone facility or as part of a larger development.  This included the former HSE health centre building at Lakelands Crescent.  While this site provides generous space and is close to schools, it was deemed unsuitable because it did not have a sufficiently high profile on the street and is not easily accessible from both parts of the peninsula.  Cork City Council continues to seek a site for the new library as a priority.<\/p> <p>Local authorities invest &euro;150 million a year in local library services and my Department also funds a libraries capital development programme.

To be fair to them, the local authorities provide libraries with significant funding, while the Department provides funding for capital and equipment.  The local authorities are good for the libraries and I compliment them on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#G00300","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561469400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.05 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1561469400,"counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 - Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at 4.45 p.m. and to adjourn at 7 p.m.; and No. 2, Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions (Amendment) Bill 2019, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 7 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes.<\/p> <p>With the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, I welcome to the Gallery members of the Minane Bridge community alert group who are friends of Senator Tim Lombard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The group does tremendous work in the community.

It is devastating news for his racing community and the local community.  Manus drove the cancer bus in Donegal.  He leaves behind five children, his wife, Bernie, his co-driver, his racing community, his family and his many friends.  This is a huge loss to his local community, to Donegal and to Fianna F&aacute;il, on behalf of which he was elected in the local elections earlier this month.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p> <p>I wish to discuss tomorrow's strike by approximately 10,000 healthcare support workers and unhelpful comment by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris,  to the effect that the strike is \"quite extraordinary\".  Describing the forthcoming strike by uttering such unhelpful and condescending comments will do nothing to help resolve the dispute to which it relates.  Rather, it will further agitate these hardworking healthcare workers.  It is sad and devastating that patients will be affected.  There will be significant delays, deferrals of elective inpatient procedures, cancellations of endoscopy procedures and a reduced number of outpatient procedures.  Patients are terrified that the strike will affect many hospitals in the city, including Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  The Minister needs to change his thinking and language and engage meaningfully with SIPTU in order to ensure that this strike, which looks to be going ahead, is postponed.  It is unfair on the workers and patients.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of a Harold's Cross school.  The Harold's Cross Stadium was purchased by the Department of Education and Skills for the purpose of building a secondary school.  We now know that that school has been assigned Educate Together patronage.  However, pupils from Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 have been excluded from the new school's catchment area.  This is despite the fact that the schools in their areas were some of the very first Educate Together schools in the city, having opened before the schools in Dublin 2, 4 and 6, which will be within the new school's catchment area.  What is happening is unfair.  A further three non-fee paying secondary schools opened up in Dublin 2, 4 and 6 recently, yet children in Dublin 8 and 12 will not have access to them either.  The Harold's Cross school is on the very border of Dublin 8 and Dublin 12.  Children in Dublin 8 who want to continue their education with Educate Together must go to Sandymount.  It makes no sense for the Department to send children from Dublin 8 and 12 to Sandymount when there will be a new, beautiful school on their doorstep.  A great campaign was organised by the Educate Together community in Dublin 8 and 12.  The Minister has met the community, but the responses have been inadequate.  It is very discriminatory that the children of Dublin 8 and 12 will not have access to this school, which is on their doorstep.  The Minister needs to do something about it.  There is a reason there are no Fine Gael councillors in Dublin South-Central.  It is because they do absolutely nothing for the children of that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#O00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1561469400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I call Senator Conway-Walsh.

As someone who has campaigned to allow the diaspora to vote in our elections for many years I am absolutely delighted that this question will now be put to the people.<\/p><p>I do not intend to address the myths and fears surrounding this referendum but instead speak to what kind of message a &quot;Yes&quot; vote would send to the world and the Irish community living throughout the globe.  We spend a great deal of time in this country rightly expressing the pride we feel in giving a cead m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to all those who visit our shores and in how that welcome contributes to our world famous tourism industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs and enriches communities throughout the country.<\/p><p>When our country was on the floor and net emigration began to rise again for the first time since the 1980s, foreign direct investment and tourism were what kept our economic engine from complete collapse.  Our new and old diaspora gave us hope of what was possible.  In September 2009 some 13% of the country was unemployed.  Ireland's economy was falling rapidly at a rate of -7.1%.  For the first time since 1995 more people left Ireland than moved here.  However, in the middle of this state of hopelessness Ireland hosted its first ever global Irish economic forum.  It blended major global businesses, thriving members of the Irish diaspora and some of our domestic champions to forge a vision of the future and of how Ireland was going to exit its economic nightmare.  This confidence espoused hope for our future and ultimately laid the seeds for what was to be the bounty of our recovery: a diet of foreign investment and tourism.<\/p><p>As a nation we have always done better when we open our minds, hearts and island.  It is in this context that I would like the referendum to be framed.  Connections to the diaspora create more jobs, enhance communities and strengthen diplomatic ties throughout the world.  Ireland is up there with the best in the world at harnessing these ties to our benefit, but we are not the best and we could be better.  The best countries give their diaspora real and meaningful voice.  Rightly, in the recent local elections everyone living in the State was provided a vote, including those who may only have been in Ireland for a year or with the intention of staying only three years.  How can we say to those across the globe who wake up in the morning and log on to <i>www.rte.ie<\/i>, gather in Irish pubs to watch the GAA championships, teach their children Irish dancing and hold passports to this country that they are forbidden from any democratic connection to our nation?  What about our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland who have been cast away by an English Government that cares little for the democratic desire to stay part of the European Union?  This vote will ask the Irish people whether they wish to allow our diaspora a formal say every seven years in choosing who is to represent our State, our island and our nation.  As far as I am concerned, the Irish of the diaspora are just as Irish as every man and woman sitting in this House.  I relish the chance to play a role in fighting for their voice to be heard in our democracy.  I urge the Government to publish the scheme and then the Bill and to let us have this referendum in October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#P00100","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I absolutely concur with what Senator Lawless has said.

Do people mean to tell me that because I returned here I can have a vote but that my brothers and sisters who live in Birmingham, London and other parts of the world are not allowed to have a vote?

The strikes planned for tomorrow and next week can be averted.  The impact they are going to have on the communities I and other Senators serve will be devastating.  This is money that is already owed to those workers.  It has already been agreed and has already gone through the mechanisms of the State.  It has to be honoured.

I ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development to come to the House and tell us why we are getting mixed messages.  We are getting one message from the HSE after a meeting on Friday to say that a quarter of the beds in Belmullet hospital are going to be closed.  Meanwhile we have the Minister, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, saying they are not going to be closed.  People need certainty and a bit of truth and honesty around all this so we can have a proper healthcare service that is delivered close to the ground as was outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Otherwise we might as well tear up the cross-party agreement that is Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#P00200","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>In light of the recent letters originating from St. Luke's hospital in Kilkenny that have come into the public domain, declaring the hospital not to be an appropriate location to carry out abortion services, I would like to raise the issue of women's access to abortion services across Ireland.  Under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, women have a legal entitlement to abortion services which must be organised in a manner that ensures this right is vindicated in practice through locally accessible abortion care.  However, a letter sent on behalf of four obstetrician-gynaecologists at St. Luke&rsquo;s asserts that the hospital is unfit to carry out abortion services.  An additional letter, dated 17 June, underlines that not only can terminations not be carried out at St. Luke&rsquo;s, but that there is no referral pathway to a hospital that can provide such a termination.<\/p><p>This is not an isolated case.  The recent issues with St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny are symptomatic of a much larger problem.  There would seem to be inadequate resourcing and training available, as well as the question of how refusal of care is managed.  As of now, only ten out of 19 maternity units in the State provide abortion services for women.  Regarding refusal of care, institutions do not have the right to refuse to provide care.  The 2018 Act stipulated that they have a duty to refer women on to enable them to access abortion care.  There should be a clear pathway of referral for a woman and it should only be a temporary measure while St. Luke's undertakes work required to establish its own termination of pregnancy service.  <\/p><p>On another matter, one of the signatories of the St. Luke&rsquo;s letter is also at the centre of a second scandal, in which women underwent gynaecological &quot;exploratory work&quot; without their consent.  It is even suggested in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that such procedures could have been carried out for potential patents and profiteering down the line.  As I understand it, again from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the hospital maintains that the obstetrician involved should have obtained consent from women.  The hospital has sought his suspension and reported the matter to the Medical Council.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is deeply troubling given our history of such cases where women were not consulted about procedures.

The report, which contains 14 key recommendations on sinking funds, fire safety and volunteer directors, needs to be serious examined.  International best practice for the management of apartment developments is a worthy subject for debate in the House.  We have clearly failed in this respect in the past and if we continue on the current path, we will fail again in future.<\/p> <p>Good weather has been forecast for the Dublin in the coming days.  As a result of pollution in Dublin Bay, a no-swim notice has been put in place.  It is easy to criticise Irish Water in this respect but there are structural difficulties.  An upgrade of the water treatment plant is to be completed by 2022.  Irish Water has said that even after that upgrade, the same factors can come into play in the aftermath of monster rain events.  I request a debate on the infrastructure in place to deal with sewage treatment.  This is a problem not only in Dublin but in Killarney, Galway and Cork and it must be addressed.  Sustainable urban drainage systems or SUDS will be part of the solution.  We need a whole-of-Government approach to addressing this issue, rather than continuing with the Government's silo approach.<\/p> <p>I will briefly comment on the upcoming strike of 10,000 members of SIPTU who will shortly go on strike in the health service.  The language used by the Government, especially its Fine Gael members, has been disrespectful to the workers in question who entered negotiations in good faith.  An agreement had been reached and these workers were due to be paid.  The question of whether this is a class issue for Fine Gael has been raised with me by many of the workers.  The language being used certainly implies that it is.  Is it being used because the dispute involves workers?  If it involved doctors, this type of language would not be used.  That is very unfortunate.  The Leader should speak to his D&aacute;il colleagues about the type of language being used.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to a school in Harold's Cross.  We talk about having a whole-of-Government approach to action on climate change.  It is not acceptable that a child standing on Harold's Cross bridge can see a school he or she could attend but then have to travel for an hour across the city to go to school.  How does that make sense in the context of climate change?

The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and his Department have invested a great deal of money, especially in rural areas, to ensure that such organisations can develop.  We need to build on the fabric of the structures in place.  It is a great pleasure for me to acknowledge and welcome my local community alert organisation because these people do fantastic work in the community.<\/p><p>I turn to a statement on Irish Water made by Senator Humphreys.  Irish Water has a national remit and Senator Humphreys raised issues in Dublin Bay.  Irish Water is working through issues in many towns and villages but we must reconsider its remit in the smaller towns and villages.  There are more than 400 settlements in County Cork but we do not have a strategy or plan to deal with them.  There needs to be a coherent plan in order that there can be regional balanced development and all these settlements can develop.  A debate on Irish Water would be helpful.  It should examine not only the major projects in its pipeline but also the smaller projects in villages and towns because they, too, need to be developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#R00300","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Like Senator Ardagh, I, too, offer my condolences to the family of the late Councillor Manus \"Mandy\" Kelly, who died suddenly and tragically in a road accident during the Donegal rally on Sunday.

He began his career by bussing people to Dublin for cancer treatment before setting up his own business, which employed 60 people in facilities management, personnel, recruitment and so on, and he also owned a cafe.  It is a tragic loss of life and he was cut down in its prime.  Three weeks ago, he was elected to Donegal County Council for the first time, on his first attempt.

We all need to step up to the plate.  We have seen the increase in the vote, especially in urban areas, for the Green Party and other campaigners who are interested in environmental matters.  There is a significant benefit to cycling, not only for cyclists but for everyone else who benefits from the road space no longer being taken up by cars.  Many cyclists will probably have taken themselves out of a car and reduced the level of congestion and the amount of pollution.  We need to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to appear before the House to address the issue of cycling, not only in urban areas but predominantly so, where it can cut congestion and improve obesity figures and health.<\/p> <p>There needs to be a safe environment for cyclists.  Many people say they will not cycle in Dublin or other cities because they are worried they will be clipped by cars or lorries or that the cities are not safe enough for them, not least if they are inexperienced.  Sooner rather than later, we need to have a debate on the provision of safe, reliable cycling routes for people of all abilities and ages.  Equally, Dublin needs a place to allow people to bring their bikes into the city centre and various other places and know that when they return to collect their bike, it will still be there.  The rate of bike theft in Dublin is very high and there need to be secure places, whether they are protected by CCTV, locks, credit card swipes or whatever it needs to be.

It is a wonderful organisation.  In principle, I support it.  However, we have yet to see the heads of a Bill for the Land Development Agency and this urgently needs to happen.  We have a situation now where the Land Development Agency is effectively not a legal entity and, therefore, it cannot receive or transfer lands.  I draw the attention of the House, particularly for those Senators who would know something of local government, to the so-called section 183 disposal notice which has to be applied for in the disposal of property assets belonging to a local authority.  That is an important reserve function of the elected members.  I believe that it is presenting some problems in the 31 local authorities and that is an issue we need to address.  The Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum is a case in point.  That is under OPW and it is somewhat different in terms of its transfer.  Until such time as we have a legal entity, called the Land Development Agency, we cannot proceed.

Many Senators will have been part of the diaspora and will have family members who are currently part of it.  I refer to recent media commentary that I do not believe accurately reflects the feeling of connectivity and value that we have for our diaspora.  Like Senator Lawless, while I would much prefer to light a candle than curse the dark, I have to take issue with some of the public utterances because we are going to come up against this ignorance over the next few months.  Many people have made really hurtful, disparaging comments about our diaspora, some of which were levelled at people like me from the North.  One columnist from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>spoke about an anomaly in regard to what he described as &quot;NI&quot; citizens.  There is no such thing as an &quot;NI&quot; citizen: there is only British or Irish designation in the North.  The only anomaly that exists is the anomaly that partitions this country and does not allow people in the North to partake fully and equally in the rest of Irish politics.  That is the anomaly we have to deal with.  Members of the diaspora are not an anomaly.  They contribute practically, tangibly, spiritually and politically to Irish life.  We owe them completion of this job of work.  <\/p><p>Members will all have received an invitation today from the Voice for Irish Citizens Abroad, VICA, campaign to attend the Dublin launch of its campaign on 10 July in the EPIC centre on the quays.  I encourage them to attend so that we - Government, Opposition and Independent Members - can join together to ensure this referendum is won.  My colleague, Senator Marshall, spoke on UTV last week where he said that no one has anything to fear from this referendum.  That applies right across the board.  None of us has anything to fear so let us go and win this referendum. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#W00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>As we know, life is a very precious thing.

She has been abandoned by the HSE, even though it could support her in St. Patrick's University Hospital by paying for a bed.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on hospital services, because she was in a psychiatric hospital where patients were not changed or showered for weeks at a time.

For example, I was struck by the comments of the executive director of the Rape Crisis Network on \"Morning Ireland\" today, who talked about the Nevin case impacting on everyone's confidence in a platform like Tinder.  She seemed loath to say anything undermining of Tinder but had no problem with some irrelevant referencing of the marriage and abortion referendums.  There is an incoherence here.  That website is itself a reflection of the fact that some people are living lonely lives and seeking intimacy with strangers in a way that is perhaps inherently dangerous.  Much of this may be beyond our remit as legislators except in the way that Senator Noone proposes, but it should be part of our national conversation.<\/p><p>In the same vein, I was struck by an RT&Eacute; \"This Week\" interview on Sunday in which some verification measures to prevent children accessing pornography were decried, partly because they might involve embarrassing adults wishing to access such content online.  This was backed up by the argument that attempts to verify age would not work anyway.  If one was making money out of the porn industry, one would be happy with such defeatism.  I have heard the argument that it cannot work or be regulated before.  I heard it when defenders of the prostitution industry wanted to decry measures to criminalise the users of persons in prostitution.  They said that it would drive prostitution further underground.  It is also the argument of the selfish, who do not want to see measures that would protect others from harm, including children, because they fear any incursion into their own supposed freedoms.  Those arguments ultimately did not prevail in respect of prostitution, and I hope that they will not prevail in respect of other dimensions of the sex industry, where regulation now seems to be needed in order to protect very vulnerable people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#Y00300","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the 19 Senators who contributed on the Order of Business.  I join with all Members in offering my sympathies to the family of the late Manus Kelly on his tragic death at the weekend.  The story we read about and saw on the news last Sunday evening was distressing and harrowing.  As Senators Gallagher, Wilson and Horkan eloquently said, the news was received just before the Ulster final, when everyone was in good spirits, and when people were celebrating what was a wonderful rally in Donegal that a life had been tragically cut short, a life that was packed with activity, family, business and politics.  On behalf of the Fine Gael group and the House, I offer our sincere sympathies to the family of Manus Kelly.  No word of ours today can ease the family's pain.  It is important that we stand in solidarity with the family.  It is an emotional issue, as a life that had given much was tragically cut short.<\/p> <p>I also join with Senator Freeman in offering my sympathies to the family of the late John Pender, another life that was cut short in tragic circumstances.  I offer his family our deepest sympathies.<\/p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Conway-Walsh and Humphreys raised the issue of tomorrow's proposed stoppage.  As I stated last week, as someone who worked as a porter in Cork University Hospital while going to college, I recognise and understand the importance of the work being done by staff across our health service.  Words matter.  That is why it is important that we all recognise that, as Senator Conway-Walsh stated, this strike will be settled and the issue will be solved.  It is important that SIPTU and the HSE sit down and re-engage with the Labour Court and settle the dispute.  The Government is committed to solving this situation.  The State has a mechanism that should be used.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We value, we understand and we appreciate the work being done every day in our hospitals.  I put it to Senator Humphreys that I say this as a member of the Fine Gael Party.  This is what I believe.  It is important that this is solved.  The Government put a proposal on the table for the phasing in of the payment ahead of 2021.  It is important that there is engagement.  We should recognise the hardworking staff.  They have requirements and legitimate pay claims.  There is an engagement being put out there and I hope it continues.  I make the appeal today, as the Leader of the House, that this would be done.<br\/><br\/>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the Harold's Cross site and school places.  The Government has purchased that site and it will provide a new primary and post-primary school in the area.  There is a commitment to have that school up and running.  I believe a national demographic exercise has been carried out but as Senator McDowell has said, a comment to which I also subscribe, perhaps the issue of catchment should be more clearly defined and looked at.  I am aware that Senator Ardagh has raised the matter a number of times but perhaps the Senator could raise the issue through a Commencement matter to get a more expeditious response.<br\/><br\/>Senators Lawless, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the forthcoming referendum on voting rights.  The referendum campaign began today in this House.  We will have that debate in due course.  It is an important referendum.  Senators referred to articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  These are opinions that have been expressed by people and there are other people who have differing viewpoints on the question, which is their democratic right.  Those of us who are for the referendum and for the question must make our case to the people, and to recognise the role of the diaspora.  We should do this as part of the referendum campaign.  I look forward to that debate.  There will be different viewpoints, which is part of what referenda are about.  We must make our case as to why it is right for the people to extend the franchise.<br\/><br\/>Senator Conway-Walsh's interest, I was going to say &quot;obsession&quot;, in the Minister for Rural and Community Affairs, Deputy Ring, continues.  We have had the issue of Belmullet hospital in the last couple of weeks.  I am sure Senator Conway-Walsh would get a quicker response through a Commencement matter.  I have given the Senator the response I have had for the past weeks.  My position has not changed but the Senator may have new information that I do not have.  Perhaps Senator Conway-Walsh could make this point through a Commencement matter.  The hospital is an important issue.  Councillor Gerry Coyle and the Minister, Deputy Ring, are serving the people well and I am sure they will continue to do so.<br\/><br\/>Senator Kelleher raised the issue of St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny.  I am aware that an additional obstetrician will be appointed.  Not all maternity hospitals are in a position to be able to offer a termination of pregnancy service.  There is engagement within the HSE and the Department of Health around the matter and a review has been commissioned on the matter discussed by the Senator.  It is a serious matter and I hope the review will come back with an answer.  We can have that debate again in due course.<br\/><br\/>Senators Humphreys and Lombard raised the issue of Irish Water, and especially the sewage being dumped into the seawater and the &quot;no swim&quot; notice.  Senator Humphreys will be aware that Irish Water is upgrading and improving its wastewater treatment plants.  The State has a duty to comply with the EU and national wastewater treatment regulations.  For example, there is a &euro;2.5 million project happening at Cork Harbour, which is one phase of the development.  Senator Humphreys will also be aware that previously the equivalent of 40,000 wheelie bins of raw sewage was being dumped into Cork Harbour but this has now been halved and will soon be eliminated due to the investment by Irish Water at the Shanbally wastewater treatment plant, in concurrence with the whole issue around Carrigaline, Shanbally and Crosshaven.  Engagement is important around the upgrading of wastewater facilities in Ringsend in Dublin.  Irish Water is to increase the capacity from 1.6 million population equivalent, PE, to 2.4 million PE, to be able to cope with capacity.  The Senator is correct that investment needs to continue.  It is a pity that some people played politics with Irish Water in the past.  We are playing politics now but to be fair to Irish Water we are making inroads.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to hold a debate on the matter.<br\/><br\/>I commend Senator Horkan for raising the issue of National Bike Week.  It is important.  A cycle map was published this week for Cork.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a need to promote an alternative to the car.  Some Members of this House have an aversion to that but to be fair to the Senator, he is a good proponent of cycling and he demonstrates that weekly by cycling in and out of Leinster House.  We need to have a greater debate about what it means to have National Bike Week.  There was an interesting debate on the radio this morning about no cars in certain parts of Europe and we should have that debate in this Chamber as well.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan again raised the issue of the Land Development Agency and I will give him the same answer I gave him the last time he raised this matter, namely, that the Minister is engaging to have the heads of the Bill published.  The Bill is not delaying the work of the Land Development Agency.  It is up and running and it has a &euro;20 million budget behind it.  As the Senator will know quite well, the Bill is required to get the full &euro;2.5 billion but the Land Development Agency is hiring staff, it is working on eight sites that are being progressed, with seven more in the pipeline, and as I said the last time, John Moran is the interim chairman of the interim board.  When the Minister is ready he will come back with the Bill.<\/p><p>Senator McFadden raised the issue of An Post and the mail centre.  It is a source of worry, not just to Athlone, but also to Cork, and there is no need for An Post to reduce the number of mail centres we have.  As the Senator said, Athlone, Dublin, Portlaoise and Cork should be retained and I commend her for raising the issue.<\/p><p>Senator Devine raised the issue of the Phoenix Park.  The best answer I can give again is perhaps to raise a Commencement matter.  I do not have the information the Senator requires.  The points she makes are interesting and pertinent and there is a need for a publicity campaign around the issue.  There also needs to be a greater promulgation of what can and cannot be done and I mention the importance of the Phoenix Park.  I commend the Senator for walking in the rain last Sunday.  I was at the Bessborough commemoration in Cork and it was an atrocious day but I commend her for that.<\/p><p>Senators Feighan and McDowell raised the issue of the Good Friday Agreement.  The discourse that is taking place across the water is a worry.  There can be no dilution of the Good Friday Agreement and I commend Senator Feighan for his great ability to reach across the political divide and to work to ensure that we have the Good Friday Agreement upheld, as Senator McDowell said.  It is an international treaty and it is lodged with the United Nations and that is why it is not about us wearing any jersey.  It is an international agreement that needs to be honoured, upheld and supported by the European Union.  I would be happy for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House in due course.<\/p><p>Senator Norris raised the issue of the credit union movement.  I can tell the Senator the Government is committed to same.  We recognise the importance of the role played by the credit union movement.  The Government is supportive of a strengthened and growing credit union movement.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, come to the House to have a debate on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#Z00200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader.

It is an interesting report on corporate governance and it is important that we restore confidence in wider society towards the FAI, especially in the area of corporate governance.  The recommendation the Senator makes on the future board or a transitionary board is one that should be looked at.  It is heartening that there is a recognition in the FAI that it has got things wrong and it wants to rectify that but from someone such as the Senator, who has brought a wealth of business and sporting endeavour, his comments are worth listening to, his suggestions have merit and I thank him for that.<\/p> <p>Senator Freeman raised the issue of our Defence Forces.  We have had a number of debates on the Defence Forces.  I cannot comment on the case of the person the Senator referenced.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I find that extraordinary.  I know the Defence Forces engage with members of staff who have mental health or other health issues.  It is important that any issues people have should be brought to the Minister for Defence personally or should be dealt with by the Army, the Naval Service or the Air Corps.  It is unfair of Senator Freeman to suggest that nothing is happening in the area of mental health.  A great deal of work is being done in that area.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, deserves great credit for the work he continues to do.  There are deficiencies in any system but, to be fair to him, the Minister of State has been proactive and has engaged extensively in respect of mental health issues.<\/p><p>Senator Freeman also referred to Private Members' slots.  There are two coming up next week.  We endeavour to have Private Members' slots.  This is a matter that the Senator might take up with her group leader and the whip of her group in the context of how they allocate slots for Private Members' time.  As the end of this term approaches, we have legislative priorities of Government to attend to.  If, however, we have a slot available and if the group of which Senator Freeman is a member see fit to put forward a proposal, I will not object to it being taken.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen should note that I did not hear Senator Noone's remarks.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland publication at the weekend is one to which we should give consideration in terms of regulation and how we view the world of the Internet and beyond.  The Senator raised many different issues worthy of debate and consideration.  I would be glad to arrange a debate on the matter in due course.<\/p><p>I welcome back our good friend Senator Ned O'Sullivan.  It is good to see him here and looking so well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#BB00500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Before I ask whether the Order of Business is agreed, I wish to thank everyone in the Chamber and others, including Members and staff, who offered their condolences following the recent death of my sister, Eileen.  I greatly appreciate the words of comfort and genuine sympathy being expressed.<\/p> <p>I would also like to be associated with the remarks made following the tragic death of Councillor Manus Kelly from the parish of Glenswilly in Letterkenny.  It was a terrible tragedy not alone for his community but also for his family.  My heart reaches out to them.  I recall how on 16 March 1993 I travelled with a councillor colleague of mine to a meeting.  On the way back that night, we parted company.  He went one way, I went another and he was killed.  His death was a tragedy.  We were together all day at a meeting.  We parted company at a village called Drimoleague.  Unfortunately, he was involved in a car accident on his way home and was killed.  That memory still haunts me.  I reckon had I driven him to Skibbereen or picked him up from there, it might not have happened.  Many of these things are outside our control.  In any event, it is good to reflect on such matters.  My sincere sympathy goes to the extended Kelly family and to the local authority members in Donegal across the board.  When these tragedies strike, they are not restricted to people in the party - they touch everyone in the community.  Unfortunately, I never knew Councillor Kelly.  However, on foot of what I have heard today from people such as Senators Gallagher and Wilson who did know him, it is obvious that he was a charismatic community man and businessman.  It is a great loss.

There we are.  With regard to this amendment, I will, of course, support my distinguished colleague, Senator McDowell, on it.  However, I wonder a little bit about it.  The statement is that \"no applicant for judicial appointment shall be questioned, interviewed or required in any way so as to disclose his or her political, religious or ideological beliefs or sexual orientation\".  Whatever about the political side, I would think it quite significant to know something about their religious background, although not which church they belong to, whether they believe in God or anything like that.  I look to the case, for example, of the late Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon, who stated quite openly that he felt he was implementing the law of God.  So much for the laws of the State.  He was a very conservative judge.  I wonder if it is not appropriate for the Government to find out if these are the kinds of ideas that somebody who is up for judicial appointment might have.  I certainly think it should bar people from the highest court of the land if they believe they are implementing the law of God or interpreting the mind of God.  These are people who are highly dangerous because of their beliefs.<\/p> <p>I will leave ideological beliefs to one side; I am not bothered.  However, I do think Senator McDowell has made the case very cogently that the Government should have the right to balance the court the way it has been balanced by the ghastly Trump in America.  He has mucked things up for decades to come by appointing a series of conservative judges.  Senator McDowell made very strong arguments that the Government has a right to select somebody because of his or her ideological beliefs to balance it, conservative as opposed to liberal or whatever.  Finally we come to sexual orientation.  Frankly, I do not give a toss what the person on the Bench does with his or her gonads.  I do not care about it at all as long I do not have to witness it.  We hear all this palaver about diversity and so on.  How are we going to know how diverse it is and what if we want to appoint a gay judge?  Personally I think it is nonsense; it does not matter a damn to me what they are.  However, if we want diversity and all this stuff, then knowledge of sexual orientation is quite appropriate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would be interested in both the Minister&rsquo;s response to these two points and Senator McDowell&rsquo;s response, to which I look forward with great interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#DD00900","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Does Senator McDowell wish to respond before I call the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#EE00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I should examine the points made by Senator Norris carefully and respond to each of them.  First, the arguments I have made that the Government can and should have regard to somebody&rsquo;s ideology or outlook, whether such a person is liberal or conservative, apply to the Government.  The whole purpose of what I said about that is that this is a choice for the Government alone.  If the Government wants a conservative person, so be it.  If it  wants a liberal person, so be it but the Government cannot delegate that discretion to a group of people who are not in government and who are not responsible to the people.<\/p> <p>I would make the general point that if this measure or provision, is not either implicitly or explicitly part of the interview process, the members of the commission may believe it is their entitlement to explore with candidates their moral outlook on one question or another or their attitude to social controversial issues  in one way or another.  By way of general preface to my remarks in response to Senator Norris, my point is that this is a governmental decision alone.  It cannot be delegated to a group of people - judges, barristers, solicitors or a majority of so-called lay people chosen by the Public Appointments Commission.<\/p> <p>I want to state also, in respect of that lay majority, I do not know who will be putting their names forward if this Bill ever becomes law.  I wonder why someone would want to be on such a commission.  Would they have an agenda?  Would they say, \"I want to liberalise Ireland\" or \"I want to make Ireland more conservative\"?  Would they have an agenda on a series of issues?  Would they have an agenda that they want to influence the way in which, for instance, the courts in the future interpret the Constitution conservatively, liberally, creatively or whatever?  My point is simply put this way, those are issues for the Government.  <\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Ross, has on a number of occasions indicated he wants to take away from elected politicians the function of choosing our judges.

Of course the charge of political cronyism is relevant in that context.  Those issues could well inform a Government in its choice of an appointee.  Cabinet members might well say, in total good faith - indeed, they ought to say it, if it is their view - that a candidate's ideological views are so extreme on some proposition that he or should not be appointed to the Supreme Court, in particular, or to the other levels of the Judiciary.  On the other hand, they might say that a good, card-carrying former member of the Communist Party would make a very good District Court or Circuit Court judge because his or her ideological views are likely to have little or no impact on his or her work as a judge.<\/p> <p>The point I wish to emphasise is that I cannot imagine that it could ever be proper to ask a candidate, whether a sitting member of the Judiciary or a person aspiring to be appointed for the first time to judicial office, about his or her political views.  I cannot imagine any circumstance in which it would be appropriate.  That is so self-evidently the case that it can hardly be gainsaid.  Therefore, it should be clearly understood that no such inquiry can or should be made by the commission in its interview process and that this criterion should be completely outside its evaluation of applicants for recommendation.<\/p> <p>The same applies to candidates' religious views.  There was a time when the Government of this State deliberately appointed members of the so-called minority religion, that is, the Protestant religion, to judicial office as a matter of policy.  The idea was that there should always be a mix of Catholics, Protestants and, later, Jews in the High Court and Supreme Court.  That was a policy to which Governments adhered because it was necessary to indicate, at a time when sectarianism in Ireland was casual and rife, that justice was administered in courts where there was no sense that any religious minority was excluded.  As I wrote in a recent article, I remember as a child and teenager seeing advertisements for a grocer's assistant with the letters \"RC\" or \"CoI\" alongside the word \"required\" in brackets.  That was a regular thing in the jobs vacant columns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#FF00900","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Surely not \"CoI\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#FF01000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Sectarianism was so rife and so deeply ingrained in this country that people used to specify the religion of grocer's assistants, housemaids and even people coming to lodge in their property.

That is how the world was then, but it is not the same now.<\/p> <p>The third concern is a person's ideological belief.  I know of former elected members of the Workers Party who must, at one stage, have been of Stalinist orientation who were, nevertheless, selected for the Circuit Court.  It seems to me that it clearly cannot be any of the commission's business to inquire into candidates' ideological viewpoint, to ask whether they are a liberal capitalist, a social democrat, a strong socialist, a nationalist or a strong something else.  Surely it must be an absolute cornerstone of a fair, merit-based recommendation by a non-governmental body that the latter does not take those issues into account?<\/p> <p>The final consideration relates to sexual orientation.  We now have members of the gay and lesbian community on the Bench, but that has occurred naturally and is not a matter of public announcement one way or the other.  It would be very strange indeed if any person could be asked for his or her sexual orientation or related questions when presenting for interview, filling out questionnaires or being evaluated by experts hired on a contractual basis.  Information of that kind must be irrelevant to the question of whether the candidate should be short-listed for the consideration of the Government.

Anybody who knew about him knew that the views that he laterally expressed, which led to controversy as regards his presidency of the Law Reform Commission and the like, were views that developed after his appointment because he had a particular path of personal development in regard to religious matters and religious organisations, which nobody would have predicted <i>ex ante<\/i>.  The circumstances which led him to the controversy to which Senator Norris refers certainly could not have been anticipated by an interview process at the outset.  <\/p><p>I will not detain the House much longer on this subject but I do recall that he advanced the view at a debate at which I was speaking in UCD, at which time he had become more clear in his controversial views, that natural law consisted of one fundamental principle - do good and avoid evil - and that all laws were in fact subsets and workings out of that principle.  The problem with that was that when one defines good and evil there are circular definitions because good is that which one should do and evil is that which one should not do.  To say that as a law one should do good and avoid evil was merely to engage in a definitional circumlocution.  In any event, he believed, absolutely, that natural law came from God and was superior to man-made law.  The Supreme Court has very strongly steered our constitutional jurisprudence away from that particular outlook.<\/p><p>I have no doubt that after Judge O'Hanlon espoused those views as President of the Law Reform Commission and a serving judge who was deputed to be President of the Law Reform Commission, the Government of the day, had his name arisen for consideration for appointment to a further position on, say, the Supreme Court, would certainly have taken those matters into account, as it would have been entitled to do.  This does not mean that a judicial appointments commission is entitled to ferret out such predispositions as part of a process where men and women who are not judges come before it and seek recommendation for appointment to judicial office.  <\/p><p>If the question posed by Senator Norris is whether a judicial appointments commission could not legitimately inquire of the matters which are referred to in this amendment, my response is that it could not do so because it would be trespassing on the discretions given to the Government of the day to whom alone the political judgment as to the suitably of a candidate on these grounds is given.  The members of the judicial appointments commission are not constitutionally invested with the function of making those decisions or expressing views on those matters.  To bring it down to much more plain and less abstract propositions, if anybody went before the judicial appointments commission and was asked about, for instance, his or her sexual orientation or asked questions which tended to explore that issue, he or she would rightly feel that a group of people who were not elected and were not selected by reference to these matters was attempting to invade the governmental discretion on these issues.

I remember when I was a child fighting with my great friend Michael Moran, who I am glad to say is still alive and friendly with me, about a dinky toy and Michael won by sticking his tongue out and saying, \"Yeah, you're not a Catholic.\"  When I went home to my mother in floods of tears she asked, \"What's wrong darling?\" and I responded \"Michael Moran says I'm not a Catholic\".

Nazism was ingrained but it did not make it reasonable.  I think that statement is absolutely shocking.  I was immensely heartened to hear from Senator McDowell that appointment to a senior judicial position is not employment.  I always thought they got paid for it.  I am delighted to learn that they do it for nothing.  I thank the Senator for that wonderful news.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell raised the wonderful notion of questions tending to disclose sexual orientation.  I wonder what they could be.  Would they be, \"Can you sing 'Over the Rainbow'?\" and \"Are you a fan of Gloria Summers?\"  Are those the sorts of questions that could be asked?  I do not understand.  <\/p> <p>On the main point that Senator McDowell made, in my opinion the commission is perfectly entitled to ask questions and to establish the position.  It is not making a judgment.  As Senator McDowell said, it is for the Government alone to make a judgment and to make a decision on the appointment.  It still has that discretion.  There is no difficulty with that.  The Government makes the decision.  It is not up to the commission to stand in judgment or to rule out any applicant on these bases.  It is a useful function for the commission to ask these questions and ascertain the facts and, acting on those facts, the Government makes its decision.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That seems to me to be quite clear.  However, there is a difficulty here with questions of sexual orientation and so on.  Senator McDowell's amendment refers to the requirements of any statement made or published under the Part.  I have difficulty with the term \"publication\".  If the commission asks questions about private matters such as sexual orientation and so on, that should not be disclosed to the public.  That is of no interest to the public.  In fact, I do not think the sexual orientation of a judge is of the slightest significance or importance.  There are good fairies and bad fairies, the same as in any population group.  I have some concern about that.<\/p><p>Another point arises apart from that.  The commission may seek information about the position of applicants on various matters.  That is reasonable enough.  This still leaves the decision-making capacity in respect of the appointment of the judge firmly in the hands of the Government.  That is my position, but I would be happy to hear further from Senator McDowell on the matter if there is something I have missed or if I have misinterpreted things.  I will make my point again.  The commission establishes information.  Acting on that information, the Government makes the decision.  There is no attempt to take away the decision-making capacity of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#GG00800","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Senator Norris seems to ignore the fact that we are dealing with Part 8 of the Bill, which is concerned with the publication.  This is set out from page 33 onwards and we are now at page 34.  The purpose of this part is to provide for a statement on selection procedures and requisite skills and attributes.  This is to be prepared in draft form by the procedures committee of the commission and approved by the commission having consulted the Minister.  Section 53(1) states:<\/p><blockquote>Subject to the provisions of this section, the Procedures Committee shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this section and from time to time thereafter when required by a subsequent provision of this Part to do so, prepare&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) a statement setting out the selection procedures, and<br \/><br \/>(b) a statement of requisite skills and attributes,<br \/><br \/>and submit each of those statements to the Commission for its approval under <i>section 54<\/i>.<\/blockquote> <p>Then section 55 permits the commission to publish those statements if it approves them.  These are effectively the ground rules for the interview process, which refers to need for selection procedures to comprise comprehensive procedures, including provision for interviews and other selection test approaches and methods in line with the requirement of the vacancy or vacancies proposed to be filled.  This is not a scenario where the commission would end up asking a candidate or applicant about his sexual orientation or political outlook with a view to publishing that information.  This provides for publishing the ground rules of the interview process.  That is what I am concerned with.  The ground rules for the interview process should be blind on these issues.  That is why the statement made or published should be interpreted in a accordance with the terms of the Bill and in particular with the definition of &quot;published statement&quot; in the section 2, which means a published statement having the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 55 (1)<\/i>.<\/p><p>If an applicant comes before a committee for appointment to any position that is deemed to be employment in an office in the public service, the applicant has a statutory right under equality legislation not to be asked these questions or not to have these questions put to him or her.  That applies under the equality legislation that these Houses have enacted.  An employer may not conduct an interview process in which he asks questions along those lines.  To ask such questions as part of the interview process is deemed to be discriminatory.  If an employer asks a candidate whether he or she is a member of the Traveller community as part of the interview process, that immediately gives rise to a statutory right to invalidate the interview process if the candidate does not get the job on the basis that irrelevant considerations were raised for his or her employment.<\/p><p>I accept what Senator Norris says about the requirement for diversity being something that might or might not make it relevant or irrelevant that someone came from the Traveller community or was manifestly of a different racial orientation by skin colour to other candidates or whatever.  What I am seeking to establish is the ground rules that the commission is obliged to create under this Part and what the procedures committee is obliged to draft and have approved by the commission subject to consultation with the Minister.  Those rules make it clear that, although this is not an employment process and although the equality Acts clearly will not apply here - they could not possibly apply - some of the foundation principles of fair interview and selection equally apply to the processes of the commission.<\/p><p>Senator Norris makes the point that if it is for the Government to decide then the commission is not making that decision and yet the commission will be faced with 12 applicants for a position in the Court of Appeal.  The commission will be obliged to cut down the number to three.  As the Bill stands, the commission must indicate its order of preference within a shortlist of three.  The real issue is if the commission is going to tell people they were not shortlisted but they were asked about their sexual orientation, religion, political or ideological views.  If that happened in any other context a case for compensation would immediately arise.  We have to be consistent in our approach to these matters.  The Government, in making a decision on whether to appoint myself or Senator Norris to judicial appointment, would be free to make the decision between us by reference to whom it considers to merit the position more and by reference to a great many things, including outlook, things we have said in the past or things we are thought likely to believe or whatever.

I think I heard Senator McDowell say that the Equality Act will not apply to this legislation.  I note the Senator is nodding.  How can that be?  Perhaps the Minister will indicate if there is a section in this Bill which excludes it from the operation of the Equality Act because I would think that quite extraordinary.  Maybe, it does.  I must have overlooked it.  Perhaps there is such a provision in the Bill.  If the Equality Act did apply we would certainly be in serious danger of judges taking cases for compensation.  They are pretty thirsty for their old lucre, those self same judges.  I previously said in regard to a proposal to grant off-licence status to supermarkets, shops and so on, which was subsequently done despite the protests of the local community, the Garda and the councils, that I did not know who these judges were, that they must be lunatics and that they certainly did not live in my area.  A judge, apparently, took an action for libel against RT&Eacute;, which I did not know at the time.  There was only one judge handling licences at that time.  I would have defended it and I would have won but I suppose RT&Eacute; found it difficult to find a barrister to go against a judge in court.  That would have been a very human situation.  I warned them anyway, because I said it twice.  I said it once on radio and once on television and of course the bloody old judge took a second case, which was most extraordinary and wrong.<\/p> <p>With regard to Judge Rory O'Hanlon, I am afraid I got his name wrong in the first instance because I called him Judge Redmond O'Hanlon, which is an O'Hanlon family name and so it was a natural mistake.  Senator McDowell is right that the correct name is Judge Rory O'Hanlon.  I did not know that he had a Damascene conversion to fundamental Catholic beliefs and so on.  That is one case.  It does not mean that there are not other people who come with these beliefs and they could be ferreted out.  <\/p> <p>Senator McDowell did not really address fundamentally the question that I raised about the fact that the Government still had the power to make the decision about the appointment of judges.  The commission establishes the facts.  Senator McDowell's point that there could be 12 applicants for a job, which the commission would then whittle down to three, lends substance to his argument but I would still maintain that the Government retains the absolute right to make the appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#JJ00600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>We are agreed completely on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#JJ00700","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#JJ00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Would the Minister like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#JJ00900","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#JJ01000","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Oh dear.

It is perfectly compatible with the current phraseology that there could be a predominance of women in the District and Circuit Courts, and a predominance of men in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.  The amendment makes it clear that gender equality should be respected as a general proposition at all levels of the courts.  It does not satisfy the view of most people on gender fairness that while there might be equal numbers among the 160 judges - I have forgotten the exact figure - if we dig down, we find that women are predominant in the lower courts and men are predominant in the higher courts.  That is hardly what the Minister set out to achieve.  The amendment proposes that the general policy objective that women should be represented equally in the Judiciary should apply at every level and we should not simply look at it in the lump, so to speak.  If we were to do that, having 80 women judges in the District Court would count as equality despite having no representation of women in the higher courts.

Senator McDowell made specific reference to the higher courts.  For the record, as of last week, the gender split was 50:50 in the Court of Appeal, and 55% male and 45% female in the Supreme Court.  It is 57% male and 42% female in the Circuit Court, and 57% male and 43% female in the District Court.  I accept that there is an absence of parity in the High Court, where the split is 70% male and 30% female.  However, that does not prove Senator McDowell's point that the higher courts, as a group, are experiencing an absence of movement towards equality.<\/p> <p>I have listened carefully to what the Senators have said.  I accept the need for gender equality and for that objective to be applicable in appointments, as my record as Minister reflects.  Reference was made earlier to a figure of in excess of 40 appointments.  If one were to go through those, they would show a determination to ensure gender equality.  Such determination is there already.  I am not convinced of the necessity of the amendment.

Clearly, the gender equality mandate is not properly addressed if we have a situation where, in the High Court, for instance, 70% of judges are male and 30% are female, but the split is 55:45 in the District Court.  The ratio might even go to 45:55.  The logic of seeking to recognise the equality of men and women, as lawyers, jurisprudents, holders of constitutional office and members of our society, should apply at every level of the courts.  It should not be the case that the overall balance between men and women right across the courts systems is more or less adhered such that we have a situation in the High Court, say, where the ratio of males to females is 70:30.  If there is a logic to the gender fairness mandate, it should apply on a layered basis throughout the Judiciary rather than just on a vertical basis.<\/p> <p>The Minister is saying that the same logic must then apply to diversity, but I do not agree with that at all.  We have racial minorities, religious minorities, Traveller minorities and gender orientation minorities.  It is not reasonable to say, for example, that there should be a Traveller in the Supreme Court as a matter of intent, because that is not practicable.  We do not need to have people of different races in the Supreme Court on a tokenistic basis.  Appointments must, in the end, be made on the basis of merit.  There is a very clear basis for saying that the gender equity principle is different from the diversity principle because, in section 7(2), the diversity principle is referred to as applying only in as far as it is \"practicable\" and \"feasible\", whereas the applicability of the gender equity principle is unqualified, with no reference to practicality or reasonableness.  In other words, the draftsman has conceded that the two principles are different by way of the different language used to reference each.  That is good grounds for distinguishing between gender equity and diversity equity.  Second, my point about layered gender equity in addition to vertical gender equity is a valid one.  Therefore, I propose to press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#RR00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I am not minded to divide the House on this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#RR00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>This is a game of bluff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#RR00400","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>That is one way of putting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#RR00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>The Minister seemed to be against the amendment until I said I was pushing it to a vote.

The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, the 2015 Act was enacted to provide certain health services to be made available without charge to successful applicants under the Magdalen Restorative Justice Ex-Gratia Scheme.  It also provides that <i>ex gratia <\/i>payments made to the women arising from the Magdalen redress scheme will not be included in a financial assessment of means under the fair deal scheme.<\/p><p>The purpose of this amending Bill, which is short and technical in nature, is to apply the same benefits to those women who qualify under the November 2018 addendum to the Magdalen redress scheme.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, the Ombudsman made a number of recommendations in November 2017 in relation to the operation of the Magdalen Restorative Justice Ex-Gratia Scheme.  The principal recommendation of the Ombudsman was that the scheme should be applied to women who worked in the laundry of one of 12 Magdalen institutions and who were resident in one of 14 adjoining institutions.<\/p><p>Following the report of the Ombudsman in relation to the Magdalen redress scheme, the Government agreed to apply the scheme to women who worked in the institutions covered by the scheme, while residing in certain adjoining institutions.  The addendum to the Magdalen redress scheme of November 2018 expended the scope of that scheme to include this new cohort of women.<\/p><p>There are currently 99 applications under the addendum.  These consist of 52 cases refused under the original scheme who may now be eligible and 47 new applications.  Applications are being processed as quickly as possible.  Some 35 applicants have received their <i>ex gratia<\/i>award and offers have issued to a further 26 applicants.  To date, &euro;28.734 million has been paid to 750 women under the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme.<\/p><p>As it is Government policy that benefits should accrue to both cohorts in the same way, the Ombudsman's recommendation also necessitated changes to two primary pieces of legislation.  A specific provision was included in the Finance Act 2018 to provide for tax exemption in respect of awards made.  The second relates to the provision of certain health services, which is the subject of the Bill we are debating today.  This which will ensure that the same health benefits that apply to the women covered by the original 2013 scheme also apply to those women now covered by the addendum.<\/p><p>This amending Bill will also make a technical amendment to the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, which provides for the fair deal scheme.  This amendment is necessary to ensure that any lump sum received through the Magdalen redress scheme by this new cohort of women is not taken into account when assessing them for nursing care under the fair deal scheme.<\/p><p>There were three other recommendations of the Ombudsman at the time.  These relate, first, to assistance to applicants who lack capacity to accept an award and, second, to a review of those cases where there is a dispute in respect of length of stay in a Magdalen institution.  A senior counsel was appointed to carry out both these tasks.  All but one of the capacity cases have now been resolved and the review in relation to length of stay is ongoing.<\/p><p>The third recommendation by the Ombudsman was that guidance should be provided for future redress schemes.

Section 3 expands the provision of health services without charge to this new cohort of women and section 4 provides that any <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment made under the scheme will not be included in an assessment for the fair deal scheme, which provides nursing home support.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the relevant Oireachtas committee decided to forgo pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of this Bill and I hope that the Bill can now progress quickly through this House so that these women can avail of these benefits as soon as possible.

The report made a number of recommendations, including the expansion of the terms of the scheme to include women who worked in Magdalen laundries but resided elsewhere.  On foot of these recommendations, the Department of Justice and Equality announced in May 2018 an addendum to the scheme, which commenced in November 2018.  The addendum extends the terms of the scheme to women residing in institutions adjoining Magdalen laundries.  These developments are positive and welcome.<\/p><p>However, stakeholders such as Justice for Magdalenes Research, JFMR, group which had previously called for an extension of the terms of the scheme, have concerns that the Bill under consideration this evening will, in fact, ensure that health and social care recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke in 2013 is actually provided to all survivors under the Magdalen <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme.  That is the point that Senator Clifford-Lee raised.<\/p><p>The Government simply seeks to add women who worked as children in Magdalen laundries while registered on the rolls of adjacent institutions to the existing health and social care aspects of the Magdalen <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme.  Justice for Magdalenes Research group has repeatedly pointed out that the care services currently provided under the RWRCI Act 2015 are not compliant with Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations.<\/p><p>The problem of healthcare provision to Magdalen survivors has been raised on numerous occasions since the RWRCI Act was enacted.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Justice for Magdalenes Research wrote in February 2016 to the national director of primary care at the HSE to ask for clarification on all the ways in which Magdalen survivors&rsquo; entitlements under the Act differ from those already available under the standard medical card.  No substantive response has been received to date.  It is essential to note that survivors of Magdalen laundries signed away all rights of action against the State in good faith, expecting that they would receive all elements of Mr. Justice Quirke's promised scheme.  The failure to provide them with the same suite of health and social care services as provided to cardholders in the Health (Amendment) Act seems to be a gross breach of trust and further abuse of a small group of older women who were very wronged and who experienced great human rights violations in the past.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.<\/p><p>By background to Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations, he delivered a report with a full list of the health and social care supports published in appendix G.  The survivors who signed away their rights are entitled to them and expected to have full access to them.  The Justice for Magdalenes Research group states that the group of women is not getting access to the full list of benefits.  The access by Magdalen women to health and social care appears to fall very short in terms of dental, ophthalmic and oral services such as access to psychotherapy for survivors and complementary therapies, including counselling.  As far as I am aware the Department of Justice and Equality has not yet established a fund for Magdalen laundry survivors to obtain complementary therapies, as was promised.  Magdalen women's access to home care falls short.  We do not want to put such women back in institutions.  There is a nationwide crisis in home care.  Could the Minister comment on the extent of requests by Magdalen laundry survivors for home care?  There are also shortfalls in respect of health and community care for survivors abroad.<\/p><p>In the context of the Bill, will the Minister commence a review of the entitlement to services of relevant participants under the headings I have outlined?  Will he also assess any differences in entitlements to services in the context of the first recommendation of the 2013 Magdalen commission report, and make a report to both Houses of the Oireachtas of the findings of the review and the conclusions drawn from its findings?  Will the Minister first produce a report on the case for including other forms of related institutions in the redress scheme, including psychiatric institutions which had a formalised relationship with the mother and baby homes?  Second, will he report on the inclusion of the Bethany Home in the redress scheme?  Third, will he report on the steps that would be required in order to complete a project of forensic accounting for the institutions covered by the redress scheme for the period of time under which women were held?  The Magdalen women to whom this Bill relates have suffered more than we can ever imagine, through no fault of their own, and those women have been very wronged.  As legislators, we must not add insult to injury by poor design of the redress scheme, myopia and amnesia, or even miserliness.  I hope the Minister will take on board the points I have raised.  I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#SS01900","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and thank him yet again for another piece of positive and progressive legislation in terms of redress.  As Senator Kelleher said, all of us as legislators have only one obligation, which is to ensure that the women receive redress.  I know the Minister has been very much to the fore in finding a pathway forward.<\/p><p>Tonight's debate is again an indication of where we have come from and a sign of the unfortunate way in which this country has struggled for decades to deal with our dark past.  While we recognise that we cannot undo what happened and we cannot airbrush it or forget it, it is important that those who suffered in many institutions are remembered and get support and that it is done in a way that is compassionate and humane.  It is also important that the Government strives to ensure that those who suffered receive the justice and support they require.  That must be done in all cases.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Quirke report six years ago, many of the proposals have been put in place to provide recognition, compassion and support to the women affected by our dark past.  The Magdalen restorative justice <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for women has been expanded and today's Bill adds further to what we are doing.  It is about providing a range of health services at no charge to the women who stood so valiantly through dark times.  In addition, the Bill provides for <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments to survivors who were not included in any financial assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  The provisions have allowed for greater health and financial security for women affected by Magdalen laundries.  The reason I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is because to be fair to him, he has been strong in what he is trying to achieve.  He is part of a Government that is trying to redress the imbalance and to ensure the supports are put in place.  We must remember that the Bill before us today hopes to expand on the support the Government has given to women who have been very wronged by society and the State.  I am pleased the Bill will pass Second Stage tonight.<\/p><p>If you do not mind, Acting Chairman, I will digress for a moment.  Last Sunday I attended the Bessborough commemoration event on a very wet day in Cork city.  It was moved indoors because of the inclement weather.  A memorial was created by the artist Jill Dinsdale which was on the grounds of Bessborough last Sunday.  It is a wooden sculpture in the form of a circle.  Each plank of timber with a scar represents a mother or baby that died in Bessborough.  In addition to the story of what happened, the sad part is that many have no idea where the babies are today.  I was struck by the beautiful memorial, which needs a permanent home either in the folly in Bessborough which is now closed or somewhere in Cork city.  The event was a gathering of women and their families who have suffered and who are looking to have their lives rebuilt or in some cases they are looking for answers.  A number of the women were angry and upset.  One of the phrases I left with was about us as citizens and legislators trying to restore dignity.  That is the reason I attended.  Some people might have felt that my presence there as a member of a Government party was perhaps wrong, but I went there in solidarity and support of the Bessborough women, one or two of whom are friends of mine.  They came out of Bessborough to tell their story and to help shape society in a better way.  For that reason I am very pleased that the Bill has come to the House.  I hope that the stories of the 904 babies can be heard and that we can get answers.  The whereabouts of only 64 of the babies have been identified in Bessborough.  Tonight, the Government is doing a piece of work which adds to what has been done already and I thank the Minister for his work.  As Senator Kelleher inferred, we all have a duty and obligation which we are trying to live up to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#TT00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of this Bill.  I wish to begin by signalling our support for this legislation, but I also state that it does come with a caveat; that is, we wish to see it significantly amended on Committee Stage, and we hope the Government will be open to such amendments given the many criticisms of the scheme as it currently operates.<\/p> <p>It is all well and good bringing this legislation forward, and hoping to see it progress speedily, but unless it addresses the deficits within the current scheme it will only compound the hurt of those it claims to benefit.  It is also worth pointing out that the Department of Justice and Equality has been less than co-operative in this regard.  Without commenting on the High Court case in which the Minister fought for the exclusion of women from this scheme on a technicality, I cannot say that the Department has covered itself in glory in that regard, nor was it in any way considerate or compassionate; in fact, quite the opposite approach has been taken.<\/p> <p>Approximately 18 months have passed since the Ombudsman published his report following an investigation by the office into the administration of the Magdalen redress scheme.  The Ombudsman's investigation found a serious inconsistency in the Department's application of the redress scheme's eligibility criteria.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Women recorded as admitted to a different institution closely associated with another named laundry, were wrongly refused admission to the scheme.  Even after the investigation was complete and the recommendations prepared, the first instinct of the Department was to push back.<br\/><br\/>In evidence to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality earlier this year, Peter Tyndall told members that in his ten years as Ombudsman, he had never reached a point where a Department had, prior to publication of a report, absolutely and categorically refused to engage in the process of accepting and implementing the recommendations made.  The report stated:<\/p><blockquote>My investigation found a serious inconsistency in the application of the eligibility criteria in that women were admitted to the Scheme who were recorded as admitted to one particular institution closely associated to a named laundry while women who were recorded as admitted to different institution closely associated with another named laundry, were refused admission to the Scheme.  This was despite the almost identical profile, characteristics and relationship with the associated laundry both institutions shared.<\/blockquote><p>On 16 April 2018, the Minister announced that he was bringing proposals to expand the scheme to Cabinet the next day, yet it has taken over a year for the Department to table this legislation.  Forgive my cynicism, but it appears delay after delay is not a technical issue, but rather a failure and opposition to making this a political priority, to the point where it was fought in the High Court.  I take no satisfaction in kicking the Government on this matter, but its performance to date has been abysmal, and disrespectful to the hurt and pain endured by survivors which was referred to by other colleagues.<br\/><br\/>The legislation applies the Magdalen redress scheme to women who worked in the institutions covered by the scheme while residing in certain adjoining institutions.  The Bill makes the necessary technical amendments to the 2015 Act to expand it to apply to women who worked in the institutions covered by the scheme while residing in certain adjoining institutions.<br\/><br\/>Again, while the Bill is welcome, it does not address some of the fundamental flaws experienced within the current scheme, and we will be seeking to take the opportunity to amend it accordingly.  I will be moving an amendment to ensure that the promised healthcare, as outlined by Mr. Justice Quirke, is finally provided by the scheme.  The Government accepted the recommendations of the Quirke report in full in 2013 but has yet to uphold this particular commitment.<br\/><br\/>As has been noted extensively, the women who are part of this scheme are not afforded the standard of healthcare in line with that provided for through the Health (Amendment) Act, HAA, card.  The card is one of the most important cards awarded by the HSE, as it gives entitlement to a range of services for the lifetime of the cardholder; and Mr. Justice Quirke recommended anyone who qualifies for this scheme be awarded this card.<br\/><br\/>Such services as complementary therapies fall within the remit of this card and are vital to those who seek to avail of the scheme.  The scheme as it currently stands does not afford people within it access to any such therapies.  The benefits of alternative and complementary therapies are well documented, particularly among those who have experienced traumatic events, and suffer with anxiety, depression or more complex conditions.  I have seen that in practice first-hand, working with survivors and victims of the conflict in the North.  These grassroots, complementary and alternative therapies often provide a real lifeline for people who are dealing with bespoke requirements.  I cannot stress enough the need for that because I have seen first-hand the benefits it can have, albeit in different circumstances.<br\/><br\/>In August 2015, several dentists confirmed publicly that, instead of receiving HAA standard services as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke and agreed by the Government in 2013, Magdalen survivors have been given a card that entitles them only to the &quot;limited and incomplete treatment [...] for most medical card holders.&quot;  The dentists called on the council of the Irish Dental Association, &quot;to publicly disassociate itself from this act by the Government and to speak out publicly on behalf of its members who do not accept the injustice we are expected to support.&quot;<br\/><br\/>An amendment that ensures HAA standard services are realised as promised is, unfortunately, necessary and I hope to see cross-party support for such calls, given they were promised many years ago.<br\/><br\/>There is also the issue within the context of the current scheme, that is access for healthcare for women abroad.  I am of the understanding that women in England are receiving reimbursement of their medical expenses, but this is a serious problem as the women need the British state to pay for their healthcare up front.  The majority of these people simply do not have the means to pay out of their own pocket and then get reimbursed.  There may be other issues that come to the fore which we feel are necessary to address, whether on Committee or Report Stages, and I hope the Minister can work with me and with colleagues to fix the shortfall within the current scheme to ensure these women are able to access the type of healthcare they deserve and which the Government committed initially to providing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062500002#TT00300","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561469400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for facilitating this debate and for the responses to the Bill.
