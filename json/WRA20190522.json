I know that the Deputy is very much aware of the issues surrounding this matter but for the consideration of the House, I would like to firstly outline some background to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides a general power to a local authority to make bye-laws in relation to its own property or services or to regulate matters of local concern.\u00a0 It is under this Act that local authorities can choose to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward.\u00a0 Some local authorities develop bye-laws to licence horse-drawn carriages operating commercially. Through bye-laws, these local authorities set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations. <\/p>  <p>  In February 2011, Dublin City Council or DCC took over responsibility for the licensing of horse-drawn carriage operators and drivers from the Garda Carriage Office. DCC made bye-laws in the same year for the licensing of horse-drawn carriages. They made these bye-laws under the Local Government Act, 2001.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has had sight of a material suggesting that DCC has no legal basis to make such bye-laws and indicating that such powers may instead still rest under the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853, 1854 and 1855 with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom the Garda&iacute; are the successors.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since this older Dublin-specific legislation was not repealed, powers\u00a0for licensing horse-drawn carriages in Dublin still exist in statute.\u00a0 This may mean that DCC\u00a0may not be permitted to\u00a0make bye-laws in this respect under the 2001 Act as bye-laws may not be made under that Act where powers exist elsewhere\u00a0in legislation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy previously raised this issue here in the House. As a first step however, my Department sought legal advice.\u00a0 Advice was very recently provided and an engagement with DCC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is on-going.\u00a0 If it is the case that Victorian legislation needs to be repealed, this will be done and, as a result, DCC will be able to use the Local Government Act 2001 to licence these horse-drawn carriages. Given the requirement for a period to prioritise Brexit-related legislative work over all other requests for legislative drafting, the Taxi Regulation (Amendment) (Rickshaw) Bill 2018 was only very recently assigned to a Parliamentary Counsel so that\u00a0work on developing the draft Bill can now commence in earnest.\u00a0Subject to the outcome of the requested legal advice, it may be that that Bill will be the vehicle with which to repeal this Victorian legislation and, following publication, It is my clear intention to progress the Bill through the Houses without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200026#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200026#WRA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[21796\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200026#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if consideration will be given to funding for the extension of the M3 motorway to Cavan town and the east-west link which are needed in the north-east; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>Proposals to deliver an upgraded East-West route linking Dundalk to Sligo, taking in Cavan, involve linking elements of the national road network and regional roads along as direct a route as possible.

Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, includingthe rail network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant Calls for Proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200026#WRA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Services Data","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200026#WRA03500"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[22091\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200026#WRA03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which rail facilities can be enhanced in the north County Kildare commuter belt with particular reference to the need to ensure the provision of extra rail carriages in compliance with health and safety regulations thereby eliminating the need to have passengers standing throughout journeys at peak times; if extra trains can be provided to meet the demand in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[22059\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200026#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the need for increased rail capacity, including the provision of additional tracks to County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

So, in order to show leadership in this area, we have a comprehensive programme of work\u00a0underway to reduce the sector's\u00a0carbon footprint.<\/p>  <p>  Also, improving public and active transport services and infrastructure is a key priority if Ireland is to cater in an environmentally sustainable way, for increasing travel demand and to provide a meaningful alternative to the private car.\u00a0 Under Project Ireland 2040, &euro;8.6 billion in investment has been committed to public and active transport.\u00a0 Major sustainable transport projects planned include the BusConnects Programme, investment in the DART Expansion Programme, and the MetroLink,\u00a0as well as\u00a0a multi-annual urban cycling and walking infrastructure investment of over &euro;110 million\u00a0in our main cities.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that prioritising investment in our public transport network is working - during the reporting period of 2017 alone, an additional 16 million public transport passenger journeys were made in Ireland while the number of walking and cycling trips also increased dramatically, particularly within the Greater Dublin Area.\u00a0 To ensure that the carbon footprint of this significant modal shift is minimised it is critical that our public transport fleets continue to improve in energy and emission efficiencies.<\/p>  <p>  In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory to low emission buses has been outlined.\u00a0 We are committed in\u00a0Project Ireland 2040\u00a0to no longer purchase diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet\u00a0from this July. \u00a0In preparation for both this immediate transition and the development of a longer-term low-carbon bus procurement strategy, my Department, together with the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, has undertaken a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials which are expected to conclude in the coming weeks.\u00a0 Under the BusConnects Programme it is expected that approximately half of the public urban bus fleet will have moved to lower emitting alternatives by 2023 with full conversion by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  It is equally important to consider the potential contribution of electrified rail to\u00a0the decarbonisation objective. \u00a0An estimated &euro;2 billion\u00a0is earmarked for\u00a0investment in the DART Expansion Programme which will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin and high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda, Celbridge\/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.\u00a0 We also expect to\u00a0accept delivery of our\u00a0first new diesel-electric trains in 2022, which will enable the enlargement of the rail fleet by approximately some 300 new rail carriages. \u00a0These major rail projects will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact our sectoral emissions profile.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the taxi, hackney and limousine sector, it is clear that electrification presents an achievable pathway towards decarbonisation.\u00a0 To this end, I established the Electric\u00a0Small Public Service Vehicle\u00a0Grant Scheme in 2018, providing purchase reliefs of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, in addition to\u00a0the range of other incentives supporting electric vehicles. \u00a0I have allocated &euro;500,000 from my Department's Green Public Transport Fund in support of this initiative further into 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0have, of course, met with\u00a0Minister Bruton\u00a0to discuss decarbonising the transport sector as we work to\u00a0prepare\u00a0the forthcoming new All-of-Government Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200027#WRB05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200027#WRB05400"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[21797\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200027#WRB05500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if consideration will be given to funding for the re-establishment of the rail line from Dublin to Kingscourt, County Cavan;

I want to acknowledge the important services provided by Rehab and the commitment of the staff of Rehab to people with a disability and their families.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the HSE that the total revenue allocation provided by the HSE to Rehab for social services has increased by &euro;8.1 million to &euro;56.1million in 2019 when compared with the allocation in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Rehab provides a range of services to young people and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, mental health difficulties, autism, or acquired brain injury. Services are co-ordinated through Rehab&rsquo;s three service delivery divisions, RehabCare, the National Learning Network and Rehab Enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  Rehab and the HSE have committed to working intensively together with a view to making substantive progress in reaching a solution to the issues. <\/p>  <p>  As the question relates to service provision I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200030#WRE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Properties","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200030#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[22160\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200030#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a centre (details supplied) is still in the ownership of the HSE; if so, if there are plans for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management of the healthcare property estate,\u00a0I have\u00a0asked the HSE to respond directly\u00a0to you\u00a0in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200030#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200030#WRE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[22162\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200030#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a private facility that cannot be accessed by all children will be included as part of the new children&rsquo;s hospital which is funded from public funds.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>The vast majority of services in the new children&rsquo;s hospital will be public services. <\/p><p>However, as part of\u00a0 the National Contract for Consultants negotiated in 2008, some consultants holding specific contracts are entitled to engage in private outpatient practice outside of their public commitment and this commitment must be conducted on site -\u00a0that is, in the hospital they are\u00a0 contracted with.

a system of National Influenza Centres and WHO Collaborating Centres around the world &ndash; continuously monitors the influenza viruses circulating in humans and updates the composition of influenza vaccines twice a year.\u00a0 These recommendations are used by national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines. \u00a0<\/p><p>The influenza vaccine purchased by the HSE is based on WHO advice.\u00a0 Composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere during the flu season is given for both quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines. \u00a0Trivalent influenza vaccines contain two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus, which have been offered to individuals in Ireland who are 65 years of age or older, those with long-term medical conditions, healthcare professionals and pregnant women. \u00a0The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland during the 2018\/19 influenza season is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe. \u00a0It also provides good protection against the influenza A strain viruses that are circulating this season as most hospitalisations are associated with influenza A. \u00a0It is expected that approximately one million people in Ireland will have received the trivalent vaccine during the 2018\/19 influenza season. <\/p><p>The HSE reviews and updates its influenza plans, including the communications strategy, taking into account lessons learned from previous years,\u00a0with a view to targeting\u00a0key groups to create the greatest impact in terms of people receiving the influenza vaccine.<\/p><p>The WHO announced on 21 February 2019 its recommendation for the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2019\/20 northern hemisphere<b><\/b>influenza season<b><\/b>for the quadrivalent vaccine. \u00a0The WHO recommends that egg based quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2019\/20 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following virus strains:<\/p><p>- an A\/Brisbane\/02\/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;<\/p><p>- an A\/Kansas\/14\/2017\u00a0(H3N2)-like virus;

In addition to its own staff, the Department also has access to scientific and technical advice in agencies under its aegis to assist it in delivering the Government&rsquo;s climate policy objectives.    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority in Ireland for the preparation and annual publication of official inventories and projections of greenhouse gas emissions, and for reporting this data to the European Union and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The EPA supports the Department in representing Ireland at relevant meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The EPA also undertakes a number of climate-related research and awareness activities, including the provision of support for the delivery of activities under the National Dialogue on Climate Action. The EPA also produces, in accordance with its statutory mandate, a quadrennial State of the Environment Report which provides an integrated assessment of the overall quality of Ireland's environment, the pressures being placed on it and the societal responses to current and emerging environmental issues.

In addition to the delivery of a range of programmes and schemes on behalf of the Department, the functions of SEAI include the preparation of national energy statistics and projections. SEAI also undertakes national energy modelling functions, informed, inter alia, by data collected from the various schemes and programmes that it administers.  SEAI had a total of 91 staff as at the end of December 2018. The EPA had a total of 410 staff at that time.

This preparation is continuing through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. While planning continues for both a no-deal Brexit and the &lsquo;central case&rsquo; scenario, the Government&rsquo;s preparations for a no-deal Brexit increased significantly in recent months in the lead up to the end of March as we faced a possible no-deal Brexit. <\/p><p>While the full implications of Brexit for our air and maritime transport are not yet clear, I do not anticipate that direct maritime or direct air services by community air carriers between Ireland and continental Europe will be affected, even in a no-deal Brexit scenario.<\/p><p>That said, a significant proportion of our goods destined for EU markets are transported via the UK landbridge to access these markets. Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the landbridge route particularly where there are increased border and custom procedures and associated delays, or were the UK to subsequently apply differing standards, road charging or regulatory regimes. The landbridge is the fastest route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food\/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Any delays or barriers to this key route to European markets will be detrimental for certain sectors. Significant work has been and continues to be undertaken through the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in seeking to ensure continued access through the landbridge to markets in continental Europe. <\/p><p>In relation to shipping, in the past shipping operators have responded to economic developments and increased or reduced capacity in response to market demands. Following a series of meetings between my officials and the major ferry companies operating at Irish ports, I am confident that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands that may arise and we have seen the evidence of this over recent months with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports. These services include the MV Celine which was last year launched from Dublin Port and will serve routes to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and the MV WB Yeats, which is operating<b><\/b>between Dublin and Cherbourg since March 2019. Additionally, a new ferry route to Santander in Spain commenced from the Port of Cork in 2018.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department have also been heavily engaged with the work at EU-level to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the aviation sector. The recently adopted Regulation (EU) 2019\/502 on common rules ensuring basic air connectivity aims to ensure the continuation of a basic level of air connectivity for citizens and business between the UK and Europe in the event of the UK exiting the EU without an agreement. While certain provisions within this Regulation have entered into force, the majority will only apply if and when the UK exits the EU without a deal. <\/p><p>In relation to infrastructural requirements, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role and infrastructural plans of ports and airports in supporting continued enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality international connectivity. Key actions planned include a new runway for Dublin Airport, continued development of Cork and Shannon Airports, investment in Ireland West Airport Knock, and for smaller airports under the Regional Airports Programme. There will also be major development of Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Foynes and other ports, as well as investment in transport connectivity to ports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200033#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Railway Stations","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200033#WRH03100"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[22268\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200033#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the action taken to date to address the issue of the shortage of car parking spaces at Sallins train station, County Kildare; the progress on this issue to date; when it is expected that substantive action will be taken on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":436,"content":"<p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has\u00a0statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure and services in\u00a0the Greater Dublin Area.\u00a0 Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann receive Exchequer funding via the NTA in relation to the provision of car parking at train stations on the heavy rail network in the GDA,\u00a0including Sallins railway station. <\/p>  <p>  I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. \u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200033#WRH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200033#WRH03500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aftercare Services","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200033#WRH03400"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[22153\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052200033#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the way in which afterschool services which focus on providing services to children from disadvantaged communities whose parents are unemployed will be provided in the future if the cuts planned under the new national childcare scheme proceed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>The National Childcare Scheme is a new, national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare.\u00a0 The development of this Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.\u00a0 By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.\u00a0 To make the transition to the new Scheme as smooth as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme once it launches (targeted for October\/ November 2019) or can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week).\u00a0 The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on\/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. By removing many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing programmes, a far greater number of families will be eligible for targeted, income-related subsidies. Many families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There may, however, be a small number of cases where a family who is currently receiving the maximum rate for full-time childcare under an existing programme, may receive less under the National Childcare Scheme, particularly if their child is &ndash; \u00a0in reality &ndash; receiving afterschool care rather than full-time childcare.\u00a0 In such cases, the family can remain on their current payment in the transition period following the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.\u00a0 I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.\u00a0 As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that my Department also funds Educational Welfare services which are operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.
