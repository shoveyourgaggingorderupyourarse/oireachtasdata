These sites will be provided with a temporary wireless connection by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, the company contracted to deliver the NBP.  This connection will remain <i>in situ<\/i>until the sites have been given a permanent connection under the NBP.<\/p><p>As of last Thursday, 10 December 2020, 162 sites had the initial connection established by NBI.  Of these, 133 had been passed to Vodafone to install its equipment to provide broadband services to the site.  Vodafone had installed its equipment at 113 of these sites up to last Thursday and is continuing with its installations.  In the Deputy's constituency of Laois-Offaly, there are eight connected broadband points, which are, Vicarstown, Ois&iacute;n House, Emo community centre in Laois and Ballycommon, Primo Coachworks, Coolderry community hall, Kilclonfert and Croghan community hall in Offaly.  They have been connected and another five sites are waiting to be connected.  It is my plan that all of these connections will be done by the end of the first quarter of 2021. <\/p><p>In addition to the substantial investment already made in the BCPs, my Department is planning to develop the facilities and services available at these sites.  Included in this programme is the use of ehealth technology at BCPs.  If successful, this could reduce the need to travel from remote areas to towns and cities for many medical appointments, which is to be welcomed.  My officials are also exploring the use of BCPs as educational settings, remote working hubs and as locations for the creative arts.<\/p><p>Under budget 2021, I secured an additional &euro;5 million to enhance remote working capability and remote access for students at BCPs and digital hubs across rural Ireland next year.  The location of all BCPs which have been installed or which are planned across the country is available on the National Broadband Ireland website, <i>www.nbi.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>The national broadband plan is the biggest investment in rural Ireland since electrification and nobody questions whether it was the right decision or anything else.  All we want to do now is establish how soon we can get that broadband.  It is a request that arrives frequently to my constituency office and I hear about people who need to go online for different reasons, including remote working, and they want to know how soon they can get access to broadband.  Rolling out the plan is akin to rural electrification and we cannot get it to every house straightaway.  In the interim, we are going to use these broadband connection points.  I have a fund of &euro;5 million and I want to help communities to create spaces where co-working can happen or where students can do their college work, or whatever, in hubs.  For a small investment, we can make a real difference in communities.  <\/p><p>A teacher called me the other day.  He was marking an exam and needed to be able to upload the results.<\/p> <p>They have poor broadband where he lives and I told him the good news was there was a broadband connection point, BCP, close to him and, with a bit of adaptation, there was no reason that could not be fitted out for him to go in and do his work.  We are continuing to roll out these BCPs across the country in black spots.  We will have 300 of them up and running by next spring, including a number in all the counties I mentioned.  There is a number of them here. <\/p> <p> There is scope to include additional BCP locations next year.  If Deputies have locations they feel are suitable, they should alert the broadband officer in their local authority, who can make the case to my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p> <p> Under town and village renewal, we have been able to fund the kitting out of some of the sites with desks, computers and other equipment.  It is important that we do that.  I have a co-working facilities mapping exercise because I believe co-working is important.  Not everybody wants to work from home permanently.  There needs to be a blend and blended working may be the way of the future: three or four days working remotely and one or two days in the office with colleagues is probably the best.  The Western Development Commission, WDC, is doing a mapping project of all the hubs along the Atlantic economic corridor from Kerry to Donegal.  Some people may not know it but we already have about 350 hubs across the country.  Some of them are more suited to community use than full-time remote working.  My plan is that we do the mapping exercise across the country and develop an app in order that any worker can log on, find the hub closest to them and meet their needs.<\/p> <p> The Deputy talked about job creation in the midlands, particularly in view of what is happening with peatlands.  There will be a big boost to the IDA as it tries to attract some of the big tech companies when we show that we have a top-class network of these hubs across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700005#C00900","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608197400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response and the details contained therein and acknowledge the progress made to date, the commitment for quarter 1 and, in the case of my own constituency, to the five outstanding BCPs due for connection in quarter 1, mainly in south Offaly.

If people could work from home and go for their coffee in the morning in Skibbereen, go for lunch in Clonakilty or have their dinner in Bandon, what would it mean to those businesses?

Remote working supported by appropriate infrastructure and facilities has the potential to encourage more people to live in rural areas while working in good quality jobs, no matter where their employers are based.  It can also help to revitalise our rural towns if remote working hubs are developed in their centres.<\/p> <p> The Western Development Commission, WDC, in partnership with the Whitaker Institute at National University of Ireland, Galway, has conducted extensive research into remote working in Ireland during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.  Recently published results from a survey of more than 5,600 people found that among those who can work remotely, 94% were in favour of working remotely on an ongoing basis for some or all of the time.  Some 23% said they would consider relocating within Ireland based on their experiences of remote working since the onset of Covid-19 and 7% said they had already relocated within Ireland.<\/p> <p> To support this shift, my Department is collaborating with the WDC to develop a national integrated network of remote working hubs supported by shared back office services.  The national network will build on the work of the WDC in developing a hub network along the Atlantic economic corridor.  The development of the national network is being overseen by an interdepartmental working group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  Work is already under way to map and classify the various remote working facilities throughout the country.  My Department has also allocated funding to the WDC to raise awareness of the hub facilities and the hub ecosystem across Ireland.  In addition, &euro;5 million has been allocated under budget 2021 for investment in remote working facilities at digital hubs and broadband connection points across rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700008#F02000","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608199200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her commitment to this and for her engagement with me on it.

That is what has been happening in recent months.  We urgently need to sit down with bodies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the WDC to set out a well-planned and well-thought-out strategy for the development of remote working as a permanent option for employees in Ireland.  The benefits it can bring to rural communities and families are many.  I am delighted to hear the Minister is showing leadership and taking the initiative on this.

One looks at companies like Indeed and Microsoft, which have told their staff they can work remotely for the long term.  That is hugely positive.<\/p>  <p>  There are benefits across the board from remote working.  For example, people can live and work in their locality; young people can avail of cheaper houses in the countryside; less time is spent commuting, which is also good for the environment; and most importantly from my perspective, it supports rural communities.  The reality is that if one is an office worker and has a good phone and broadband coverage, one can do the same job in Ballybay as one can do in Ballsbridge.  We need to seize the momentum on remote working.  The T&aacute;naiste is working on the development of a national remote working policy.

My Department provides substantial funding for outdoor recreational infrastructure through programmes such as the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, the walks scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund.  My Department also works with State agencies, such as Coillte and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as well as other stakeholders, to facilitate the strategic development of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe, the Countryside Council, is central to this work as it brings the outdoor recreation stakeholders together in an advisory role.  In June 2019, Comhairle na Tuaithe was given a new mandate to strengthen its role in the development of the outdoor recreation sector.  Dr. Liam Twomey was appointed as chair of Comhairle na Tuaithe and he has driven the new mandate with the support of the council members.  Earlier this year, the group commenced work on the development of a new national outdoor recreation strategy to provide a vision and framework for the growth of the sector.

This group will be particularly important in the development and implementation of the national outdoor recreation strategy.  My Department continues to provide substantial support for the sector with expenditure of approximately &euro;11 million on the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme this year.  At the end of last year, an additional ten trails were approved for inclusion in the walks scheme.  An external review of the scheme is also expected to be completed in the new year.  This will pave the way for the further expansion of the scheme to 80 trails.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700011#J01000","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1608200400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The genesis of setting up Comhairle na Tuaithe and the most urgent problem it faced in its early years was the whole issue of access to farmers' lands, particularly hill land and mountains.

Under section 20 of the Act, the times at which annual leave is taken is ultimately determined by the employer.  This is subject to the leave being granted within the leave year to which it relates or, with the consent of the employee, within the six months after the end of that leave year.

While there have been fewer opportunities for travel and recreation activities this year, it is still very important that employees avail of annual leave to take a break, avoid burnout and maintain an appropriate work-life balance, even if that means that they cannot travel abroad or out of their county.  This is even more true for staff who have been engaged in work related to the pandemic and have been through an extremely stressful and challenging year.<\/p>  <p>  To date, my Department has not received any representations that would suggest that the carryover of annual leave is a particularly pressing issue at this time.

The restart grant scheme closed to new applications on 31 October and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, has been in place since that date.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's specific question, as of 11 December 2020, Clare County Council has awarded 1,045 restart grants and 1,735 grants under the restart grant plus scheme.  In total, more than 118,600 applications have been managed under both restart schemes throughout the country.  I compliment the local authorities on their approach to the schemes, working with the relevant Department and with my Department to administer these funds and get them out as quickly as they possibly could.  My understanding is that there has been quite a high success rate in terms of applications and processing times.  The schemes have been very successful and I am glad Clare County Council embraced them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700016#O00100","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1608203400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for providing those details.

While I do not have details of individual cases, we certainly value every job that is out there and every business that creates those jobs.  During the Covid period and as we enter into the post-Brexit situation, we recognise how important it is that we, as a State, support businesses and jobs.  That is what we use taxpayers' money for and it is why we have seen a serious amount of money allocated over the past 12 months to supporting jobs across a number of schemes, including the restart grant, CRSS, the wage subsidy scheme, the rates rebates, and all the various vouchers available through the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and local authorities.  We are here to support businesses.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy is right that there are a couple of areas in which people are still finding it difficult to access all the supports.  They can all avail of the wage subsidy scheme and many of the vouchers, but some of the schemes are directly linked to premises because there are costs, including fixed costs, to having those premises open.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that our Department is engaging with the Department of Finance and other Departments to focus on each individual sector and area to identify where people cannot avail of enough supports to keep their businesses open.  I will certainly take on board the two cases the Deputy has represented and feed them into the system.  We are looking at this issue in the next couple of weeks and into January.

There are supports in place for them now but bed and breakfast owners in County Clare are very worried to hear that many of them are going to be approached by the Valuation Office in early 2021 and that they will be judged as being commercial entities.  In some places, like Killarney, for example, there are large 14-bedroom bed and breakfast businesses that could be considered to be almost mini-hotels.  However, that model of bed and breakfast accommodation is not on offer in County Clare and the operators there are worried that, at a time when they are struggling to keep their businesses going, they will be subjected to rates.

It is important that we revaluate at regular intervals how the rates are administered and charged.  That process is well under way and is being rolled out throughout the country.

The Brexit loan scheme was launched in 2018 to provide SMEs and companies with fewer than 500 employees with an option to access competitively priced working capital finance to help them to mitigate and react to the impacts of Brexit.  It was intended that the scheme would be available for one year prior to and one year after Brexit.  With the repeated deferrals to the Brexit deadline and the transition period, many businesses, quite naturally, delayed their Brexit preparations.  The added disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic has meant that businesses have had to focus their efforts through much of 2020 on successfully navigating this unforeseen crisis.  These factors have resulted in a modest uptake of the Brexit loan scheme to date with approximately &euro;57 million in loans approved to 281 businesses.<\/p>  <p>  In comparison, the future growth loan scheme, which was established to provide long-term lending to SMEs and also aimed to close an identified gap in low investment and underinvestment among Irish SMEs, has seen a rapid uptake from its launch in April 2019.  The initial &euro;300 million scheme was expanded by the Government through a further &euro;500 million in available lending.  There continues to be high demand for the scheme and to date &euro;523 million of the &euro;800 million scheme has been sanctioned for 2,601 businesses.  It is very encouraging news that even at this time, so many businesses are seeing opportunities for expansion and are taking steps to invest in their businesses to ensure their longer-term sustainability and growth.

I know that the T&aacute;naiste is well aware of this but I will give him a number observations from this review:<\/p> <blockquote> \tGaeltacht companies are significantly more exposed to a disorderly Brexit than the Irish economy in general, due to their reliance on the UK as both an export market and a source of raw materials and other imports ...

That is effectively an interest-free loan for the first year and a low interest rate thereafter.

I will take a look at that review.  I received a brief summary of it but I have not read it from cover to cover and I will do that over the Christmas break.  We have a package of grants and loans.  There is, of course, more demand for grants than for loans because grants are not repayable and that will always be the case.  Businesses taking on debt need to make a decision on whether they want to do this.  One of the reasons the future growth loan scheme has been so successful is because it is long-term money at a low interest rate for businesses that can afford to expand.  These are businesses that can afford to repay loans.  The other loans are for working capital, which is short-term lending to get over the hump of Brexit or the pandemic, and there has been less demand for them.<\/p>  <p>  It might be the case in Gaeltacht regions that people are not getting the level of information they should be getting on what is available.

The State's long-standing preventive restructuring framework in examinership is internationally recognised and has proven to be a successful tool for restructuring in its current form.  However, I accept that the cost of examinership is prohibitive for smaller businesses.  The T&aacute;naiste wrote to the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in July requesting it to consider the issue of rescue for small businesses, following on commitments in the programme for Government.  The CLRG completed its work and reported back to the T&aacute;naiste and me on 24 October 2020.  The report set out its recommendations for a proposed new process for the rescue of small companies, distinct from the existing examinership legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of company rescue extends far beyond the distressed company itself.  It impacts all creditors, which are often other small companies.  Any new framework must reflect the delicate balance between sometimes competing stakeholders and provide sufficiently robust safeguards for the protection of creditors, particularly employees.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties faced by many small companies.  I am committed to progressing legislation to support their long-term viability and preserve employment.  Already, I have steered legislation through the House to assist in the survival of companies during the Covid-19 crisis.  The Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act makes necessary temporary amendments to the Companies Act 2014 and related legislation.  It provides for an additional 50 days in the examinership process, bringing the period up to a total of 150 days, and it increases the threshold at which a company is deemed unable to pay its debt to &euro;50,000.  The interim period for this legislation was due to end on 31 December 2020, but, following Government approval this week, it will be extended until 9 June 2021.  This means that the extension of examinership to 150 days and the threshold change remain in place.  It is important, in light of the extension of these temporary provisions, that viable companies and co-operatives have sufficient flexibility to restructure and trade through the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding what the CLRG has proposed, it is the firm ambition of the T&aacute;naiste and me to have a new process enacted in a timely manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700018#Q00200","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1608204600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and welcome his acknowledgement that the cost of examinership, running between &euro;80,000 and &euro;130,000 and involving High Court action, is way beyond the scope of most companies.

We have asked the Company Law Review Group to look again at the aspects of company law in this area and that group is due to report back to us before the end of the month.  We have jointly met with employer and union representative bodies in November to continue a discussion on the various legislative provisions that deal with redundancy and insolvency from both a company law and an employment law perspective.  There has been engagement and toing and froing around recommendations and suggestions in that conversation.  Included in that is the Cahill Duffy report and the recommendations in that.  There have been positive and constructive engagement and meetings with the stakeholders, where the discussion focused on identifying whether there are gaps or weaknesses in either body of legislation.

Unions are experienced and best placed to give out good advice.  In our view, they have given good advice over the last couple of months.  Others have given other counter-advice, including the Deputy.  He comes in here with claims around assets and millions here and millions there.  I have not seen any evidence.  He has probably given advice to workers based on his opinion on what assets are there.  That might not always be the best advice.  We would say the unions are in the best position to give good advice and guidance, have negotiated quite well and have worked with us as a Government around the review of the legislation.  We have said we will take on board any positive recommendations.  If we can strengthen the legislation on behalf of workers, of course we will do it.

From ushers to staff in the Bills Office, the canteen and everywhere else throughout the complex, they do incredible work and deserve our thanks, particularly at this challenging time.  I also wish my colleagues in the D&aacute;il and the Irish people a very peaceful Christmas.  While we must remain vigilant to the threat of Covid-19 to protect ourselves, our families, our communities and one another, this Christmas provides us some relief and comfort in what has been a difficult year.  Gu&iacute;m Nollaig Shona agus athbhliain faoi mhaise do na Teachta&iacute; uilig.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Christmas can be a time of much worry for some.  Household debt is a problem for many workers and families.  Due to Covid-19, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs and many families are now facing their most difficult Christmas in years.  The choices facing them are stark.  How can they make Christmas special for their families and still pay the bills?  Do they buy presents or heat their homes?<\/p>  <p>  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has described this year&rsquo;s annual appeal as one of the most difficult in its 176-year history in Ireland.  Difficulties for some present opportunities for others and there are always those who are ready to take advantage, provided they can.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others have warned about the threat posed this Christmas by licensed moneylenders and the extortionate interest rates they charge.  There are an estimated 330,000 customers of moneylenders, with an average loan size of &euro;556.  For many in financial difficulty, moneylenders provide an easy line of credit but at a high cost.  Licensed moneylenders are permitted by the Government to charge an annual percentage rate, APR, of 187%.  That increases to 288% when permitted collection charges are included.  The Citizens Information Board has stated that this extortionate level of interest leaves many borrowers unable to pay for life&rsquo;s essentials and creates a vicious cycle of repeat borrowing.  The majority of these borrowers are women; many of them are lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  On 6 December 2018, I introduced the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill.  It would introduce a statutory cap on the interest that moneylenders can charge.  It has passed Second Stage and will be considered by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach next month in oral hearings as part of the next Stage.  It has already received submissions from interested parties.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is an outlier when it comes to the extortionate interest rates these moneylenders are permitted to charge.  Interest rate caps are applied in 21 countries across the EU, including Germany, France and Italy.  Many of these caps were introduced because their countries believed that it was morally unjustifiable to charge ultra-high interest rates, especially against the most vulnerable and those least able to repay.  Germany described such rates as lacking moral legitimacy.  Finland described them as unconscionable.  In Ireland, however, anything goes and the sky is the limit.  That is not acceptable and should not be tolerated.<\/p>  <p>  A statutory cap on the interest rates that moneylenders can charge is supported by the Social Finance Foundation, the Citizens Information Board, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, the credit union movement and charities such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Government commit to working with the Opposition on this legislation?  Can we see a new dawn in respect of moneylenders and the interest rates they charge?  We have legislation that has passed Second Stage in this House and is before a committee.  It can be improved on and I am open to suggestions.  A cap needs to placed.  Let us ensure that this is the last Christmas that moneylenders can charge up to 187% APR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700021#T00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1608206400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I should mention that there are low-cost loans in place, for example, through credit unions.  When I was the Minister for Social Protection, I established the \"It Makes Sense\" loan, which was a low-cost loan provided through credit unions.  People could repay it through their weekly social welfare payments or, as was often the case, the household budgeting service.  I am unsure as to whether the scheme still exists, but it was set up with the express purpose of providing access to low-cost loans, especially around Christmas, to people who needed them but would not normally get them from the banks or elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  I have not had a chance to speak to the Minister for Finance about the Deputy's proposed legislation in a while and I am unsure about what approach to it he wants to take.  I do not have an objection to there being a cap on interest rates that were previously described as usury, that is, so high that they should have been illegal.  When passing any legislation, however, we must consider the law of unintended consequences.  While a law may be passed with a view to capping interest rates, there is a risk of an unintended consequence of creating a new, larger market for moneylenders.  This is the type of balance we must get right in any such legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700021#T00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1608206400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his comments on supporting a cap on the interest charged by moneylenders.  I acknowledge that Fianna F&aacute;il supported the legislation two years ago, and while the T&aacute;naiste's Government of the time did not, I welcome his remarks now.<\/p>  <p>  We need to deal with this issue.  The Bill is under pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Numerous submissions have been received that address the point the T&aacute;naiste raised, which is a concern we all have about whether the Bill would open a market for illegal moneylenders.  I will cite the University College Cork report, which is the expert report in this regard, \"However, there is no empirical and undisputed evidence that interest rate restrictions result in an increase in illegal moneylending.\"  It points to how the UK stopped exorbitant pay day loans and this did not result in illegal moneylending.  As the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged, there would still be the avenue of the credit union movement.<\/p>  <p>  We need to put some urgency and commitment into this matter.  As the legislation's sponsor, I am open to accepting amendments and to its provisions being introduced on a tiered basis, but let us work collectively as a House to ensure that 2021 is the year when the interest rates of moneylenders are capped and we stop accepting that moneylenders can charge customers 187% APR.  We know what happens at this time of year.  Moneylenders prey on people's vulnerability.  The pandemic has exposed that in a greater way.  There is a duty on us as legislators to protect individuals from this type of lending activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700021#T00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1608206400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I will take the matter up with the Minister for Finance and see what his thinking on it is.

As the Deputy knows, moneylending at extortionate rates happens off the books, which makes it inherently unofficial, and there will not be evidence unless someone comes forward and says it is happening.  However, I have an open mind on this matter.  It may well be the right thing to do in 2021 to say that no lender can charge an interest rate above a stated amount, but we need to bear in mind that, if we decide to do so in an attempt to put a stop to high interest rates in the official lending market, we could create a new market for moneylenders and make the situation worse.

More than 300 documents were released to me and also to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last night<i>.  The Irish Times<\/i>reported that the newly appointed Minister for Justice requested the Woulfe appointment be brought to Cabinet on 6 July.  By the Minister's account to the D&aacute;il, that is a full five days before she consulted the Government leaders about it between 11 and 14 July, as required by the Cabinet handbook.  How is it possible that a memorandum, which I have in my hands, could be commenced early in the morning and signed off at 11.17 a.m. on the day of a Cabinet meeting, five days before the Minister said she consulted the three leaders of the Government?  A memorandum for the appointment commenced at 7.45 a.m. and was signed off by the Minister at 9.34 a.m.  It was then pulled by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Justice, therefore, was intending to appoint the Supreme Court justice but she had not disclosed this to the party leaders, according to her own timeline.  Her spokesperson, however, told <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that the Minister had been told it was urgent.  Who told her it was urgent?  Who tells the Minister for Justice the appointment of a Supreme Court judge is urgent?<br\/><br\/>In the D&aacute;il, the Minister said a draft memorandum was submitted to her office on 6 July.  It was beyond that; it was actually signed off by the Minister and put forward by the Department of Justice to the secretariat of the Cabinet, which is run by the Taoiseach.  This was not told to us three weeks ago.<br\/><br\/>I have a number of questions for the T&aacute;naiste.  I appreciate this documentation only emerged last night.  On what date did the T&aacute;naiste tell the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, that S&eacute;amus Woulfe would make a good judge?  Timelines are now becoming critically important.  Prior to 6 July, who told the Minister this appointment was urgent?  Most importantly, how could a Minister for Justice sign off on the appointment of a Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Woulfe, on 6 July and have a speaking note prepared on it when, by her account to the D&aacute;il, she only consulted the three leaders of the Government between 11 and 14 July?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700021#T00800","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608207000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I am afraid I am not in position to answer the Deputy's questions.

In the end, it was not.  There were several Cabinet meetings after that.  The Minister for Justice had time and, indeed, consulted all party leaders and the Attorney General before making the appointment.  The Deputy will know from his time in Cabinet that it is often the case that something is put on the agenda but then not taken or withdrawn for many different reasons.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding is that the Chief Justice had written on several occasions asking that this appointment be made.  He felt there was a vacancy in the Supreme Court that needed to be filled.

I might speculate that the source of the urgency was that this was an appointment that the Chief Justice wanted to be made.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the date, I do not know the exact date but I recall that, in questions that I and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, answered before, we gave the range during the period of dates where we would have had that conversation, which would have been, obviously, after her appointment as Minister for Justice and before that decision was taken to bring that appointment to Cabinet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700022#U00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1608207000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I genuinely appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's honesty.

One of the central themes of what the Minister continuously says is that she followed the Cabinet handbook to the letter of the law.  If, however, she followed the Cabinet handbook, why, all of a sudden, very early on the morning of 6 July, did she start a process to bring a memorandum to Cabinet to appoint Mr. Justice Woulfe, considering the Cabinet handbook says she must consult the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Deputy Ryan?  That is a complete contradiction.  Second, subsequent to that, after this was pulled by the Taoiseach for some reason we do not know and which we need to know, why was the appointment of a Circuit Court judge added to the Cabinet agenda?  Third, why did the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, in the middle of a general election campaign, ask for the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, to meet to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, but went against the advice of his officials who felt there was not an urgency in the appointment of that position and that it would be unusual for Department of Government to make such an appointment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700022#U00300","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1608207000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Again, these are questions that do not involve me directly so they are difficult and impossible for me to answer.

At that point, the Minister for Justice had, of course, spoken to the Attorney General and all the party leaders, and came forward with one name which she recommended to Cabinet.  That was agreed by Cabinet unanimously.  I know from my experience as a Minister that it is often the case that one tries to get a matter on the Cabinet agenda and somebody comes back, maybe one of one's own officials or the Department of the Taoiseach, and says we are not ready for that, hold it off or carry it over.

He was asked about a contract worth &euro;14 million that the HSE had entered into for ventilators.  It seems there were serious problems with that purchase.  As I understand it, the ventilators have never been used in a clinical setting.  There were quality issues about the ventilators in question.  That raises a large number of issues.  I fully accept that this was a pressurised period.  Everybody was stressed about the situation and there was a rush to get medical equipment.  It raises questions, however, about procurement and financial controls, and those are important at any time.<\/p>  <p>  One must wonder how this contract came to be placed.  It was placed with a company called Roqu, which had previously only been known for event management and organising festivals in the Middle East.  It had a residential apartment address in Dublin city centre and one employee, who was the owner of the company, Mr. Robert Quirke.  How much does the T&aacute;naiste know about the awarding of this contract, which resulted in the taxpayer being caught for huge figure of &euro;14 million?  What does he know about contacts between the owner of the company, Mr. Quirke, and the HSE?  Who contacted whom?  Was there any contact regarding this with either the then Minister for Health, the T&aacute;naiste, who was Taoiseach at the time, or anybody else at a political level?  How did it come about that contact was made and then the subsequent order was placed?  There are serious concerns about this and how it came about.  What approvals were required?  Were political approvals required for placing that order?  I would appreciate if the T&aacute;naiste could answer those questions.  We know that a subsidiary of the company in question, another Roqu company, went on to do the testing in County Roscommon and was also involved in developing the health passport app.  One wonders how these contracts were awarded to a company with no history and, apparently, no expertise in the health products area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700022#U00500","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1608207600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>As the Deputy rightly said, that was a pressurised period.

The programme for Government commits to the provision of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.  As set out in the HSE's options appraisal, the preferred option for a second cath lab and associated 12-day ward providing six additional beds, is on the roof of the existing cardiology department in Waterford.  I know from working with Government Deputies in the county that the ultimate ambition is to achieve 24-7 primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, cover if that is viable.  The second cath lab is a major and significant step towards doing exactly that.<\/p>  <p>  Funding was allocated in the capital plan for the provision of a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford.  Planning permission was received from Waterford City and County Council in January of this year.  The disability access certificate was granted in April and the fire certificate was granted in June.  Preparation of contract documentation commenced and contractor selection is complete, subject to a cooling-off period.  The project went to tender on 30 September.  The tender process being used is a two-stage process, which normally takes about four months to complete.  Tenders for the main contractor were received on 24 November, while tenders for the mechanical and electrical subcontractors are due on 21 December.  The works at the new cath lab are due to commence in the first quarter of the new year.  It is expected that it will take about 12 months to build and then it is anticipated that it can be commissioned and opened and operating in the first half of 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700023#V00900","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1608207600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>As I said, the Taoiseach said in recent days that this was not a resourcing issue but that this was to do with academic allegiances, reviews and all of that.

The Deputy mentions that there are two centres in Dublin.  There were three centres.  We went from three centres in Dublin down to two, and those two centres cover a population of probably 2 million people, all the way from the Border with Northern Ireland down to Kilkenny and north Wexford.  It is roughly one centre per 1 million people.  I appreciate that the Galway and Limerick centres cover a smaller population.

However, it is something we have to bear in mind.  Public health guidelines state that when a Covid-19 positive case connected with a school arises, the public health section contacts the school and undertakes a public health risk assessment to identify what action is required.  When a risk assessment is undertaken, it takes into account all of the evidence in the particular circumstances, and advice is provided to the school on this basis.  Schools are then required to follow public health advice, and where a school is advised by the public health section to close, it must do so.

This year has been like no other.  The arrival of Covid-19 on our shores in March represented a major challenge for the people of this country and us, as their representatives, in this Oireachtas.  People have been cut off from family and friends, have lost jobs and have seen their businesses collapse.  Tragically, 3,283 people lost their lives on the island of Ireland as a result of this virus.  Our fight against Covid-19 continues.  Even at this time as we approach Christmas, a special time for so many individuals and families, we are reminded of the impacts this virus is having and the actions we all must take to prevent its spread.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the response taken by the previous Government and the current Government has been truly extraordinary and it needed to be.  The Appropriation Act 2019 approved &euro;54.6 billion in net voted expenditure.  In this Bill, subject to the approval of the House, we will be approving &euro;69.7 billion, representing a &euro;15.1 billion increase on 2019.  That is a rise of 27% and it highlights in a stark manner the scale of the Government response.  Much of this money was spent on meeting the health crisis: through investment in the public health system; in supporting incomes and jobs through the pandemic unemployment payment, the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme; and in saving businesses through the restart grant, the local authority commercial rates waiver and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  While the challenge has been unprecedented, so too has the response from Government and from the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The Appropriation Bill 2020 is an essential element of financial housekeeping that must be concluded by the D&aacute;il this year.  The Appropriation Bill has two primary purposes.  The first is that it provides legal authorisation for all of the expenditure that has occurred in 2020 on the basis of the Estimates voted by the D&aacute;il over the course of this year.  These allocations, known as the amounts to be appropriated for supply services, are set out in section 1 and Schedule 1 of the Bill.  These relate to the Revised Estimates, Further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates agreed by the D&aacute;il.  In aggregate, these Estimates amount to &euro;69.7 billion.  This represents not only the substantial level of support provided to households and businesses with regard to Covid-19, but also the commitment to provide for the necessary infrastructure to support our continuing social and economic progress, and a significant investment in the delivery of our essential day-to-day public services, which the people we serve rely on.<\/p>  <p>  In aggregate, taking into account expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund, total gross voted expenditure made available this year was &euro;87.3 billion.  The equivalent amount planned for 2020 in the pre-Covid Revised Estimates Volume was &euro;70.4 billion.  Making provision for additional exceptional spending of this scale was absolutely necessary given the profound effect of the pandemic on our people.  Over the course of the year, the Government has taken significant steps to cushion the impact of the crisis on households and firms.  These additional resources, approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in Estimates over the course of the year, have been crucial to support our key front-line services in responding to Covid-19 and to support workers and businesses devastated by the impact of the virus.<\/p> <p>This response has been driven by the priority to protect citizens from the virus and to ensure that the health service can respond effectively to meet demands for services while dealing with the impact of the pandemic.<\/p> <p> The second key purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into next year, in the period before the D&aacute;il votes on the 2021 Estimates.  As set out in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, the authority for spending in 2021, prior to the agreement of the 2021 Estimates by the D&aacute;il, is based on the amounts included in the 2020 Appropriation Bill.  It is for this reason that it is so important that this Bill is enacted before the end of 2020.  If it were not, there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys in 2021 from the start of January until approval of the 2021 Estimates.<\/p> <p> In recognition of the difficulty faced by Departments in planning for capital projects, the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in 2004 allow for carry-over of up to 10% of unspent voted capital expenditure from the current year into the following year.  This provides a degree of flexibility in terms of capital expenditure planning.  The 2020 Appropriation Bill sets out the capital amounts which are to be carried over to 2021 on a Vote basis.  In aggregate, capital carry-over from 2020 to 2021 amounts to &euro;748.5 million, which is approximately 7.5% of the overall Exchequer capital programme for 2020.  This is significantly higher than last year's equivalent figure of &euro;215 million.  This increase has been driven by the delays to capital projects that occurred in 2020 as a consequence of Covid-19.  As evident from the monthly expenditure figures, spending plans were impacted by project interruptions due to the pandemic.<\/p> <p> In addition, substantial additional capital resources were made available to Departments to ensure that all feasible work could proceed over the course of 2020.  As can be the norm in capital development, planning and procurement of capital projects can take some time to become operational.  Therefore, while some of the stimulus projects have commenced in 2020, it will be 2021 before some of them are completed.<\/p> <p> With almost &euro;750 million in carry-over to fund capital investments next year, this will bring the overall amount available to Departments for Exchequer capital spending in 2021 to more than &euro;10.8 billion.  This represents a record level of investment as we seek to address the challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit next year.  Schedule 2 of the Appropriation Bill sets out the proposed capital carry-over amounts.  The Revised Estimates Volume for 2021, published yesterday, includes for each Vote availing of the capital carry-over facility a table listing the amounts to be deferred by subhead.<\/p> <p> As in previous years, the Appropriation Bill provides for a repayable advance from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account in order to meet certain 2021 Exchequer liabilities due for payment over the first week of January.  The need for this provision arises because, with the banking system closed on 1 January, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year in order to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.  The amount provided in section 3 of the Bill is &euro;280 million.  There is also a need to pre-fund An Post in order to meet certain payments due between 1 January and 5 January 2021, so that payments can be transferred from the Department of Social Protection to the network of post offices throughout the country.<\/p> <p> The annual Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping undertaken by the D&aacute;il each year.  The passage of this Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has taken place in 2020, on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the D&aacute;il in the course of this year.  Importantly, it will also ensure that voted expenditure can continue into 2021 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2021 Estimates.  This means keeping our public services such as schools and hospitals operating, as well as continuing payments funded from voted expenditure in 2020 such as the employment wage subsidy scheme and the other social assistance scheme payments.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700029#CC00300","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608211200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid ag bogadh ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; p&aacute;irt&iacute; Shinn F&eacute;in agus an Teachta Farrell agus t&aacute; s&iacute; ag roinnt a cuid ama.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700030#DD00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1608211200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama le mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta &Oacute; Dochartaigh.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus leis an Aire.  Tuigim gur Bille f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo chun a chinnti&uacute; gur f&eacute;idir le Ranna Rialtais airgead a chaitheamh ag t&uacute;s mh&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir agus nach dteast&oacute;far V&oacute;ta&iacute; breise chun &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; bun&uacute;s bunreacht&uacute;il leis an mBille seo agus beimid i Sinn F&eacute;in ag tac&uacute; leis.  I understand that there is a constitutional requirement for this Bill, as it legislates for the financial resolutions which includes all the Estimates voted on by the D&aacute;il this year.  This year, the figure is &euro;69.7 billion, which reflects the net amount voted by the D&aacute;il, while &euro;87 billion is the full amount allocated.  The key to this Appropriation Bill is that it is a constitutional requirement and that it is essential in order to ensure that Departments can spend, come January, and therefore we will be supporting it.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill allows for the four-fifths rule, provided for under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, which means that Departments can spend four fifths of the previous Appropriation Bill without having to wait for a Vote, and if the Bill was not enacted these Departments could not spend.  The Bill also allows for capital carry-over, as per the Finance Act 2004.  Each Department can carry over 10% of its capital allocation to the next year.  This year, I note that the carry-over is 7.4%, which is higher than usual, however that is due to the restrictions imposed this year as a result of Covid-19.  Hopefully, next year will see a better year and we will be able to see large-scale capital projects on a regionally balanced basis.<\/p>  <p>  As I have raised with the Minister many times, capital investment will be key, not only in dealing with the major cracks in public infrastructure but it will also be a key driver in terms of job creation, as we hopefully move forward out of this crisis.  This point is not just being made by me and my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, but it is something that has been raised across the political spectrum and by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the International Monetary Fund and by many others.  We have seen large-scale job losses in the State this year, and I think of those families in the lead-up to Christmas, which is a trying financial time for many, made even more worrying at the very uncertain financial future many are facing as we approach 2021.  The Covid-adjusted unemployment figures are approximately 20%.  We know that capital investment has a positive jobs-multiplier effect, so if we want the economy to bounce back quickly in 2021, it is of the utmost importance that these matters are attended to urgently.  We are all aware of badly needed capital investment projects and the deficiencies in our creaking infrastructure, which could certainly use a capital investment boost.  Given that we are going to be playing catch-up next year, I sincerely hope that any capital projects that are in train will be fast-tracked and given the appropriate resources, be they housing, healthcare, transport or environmental projects.<\/p>  <p>  Ar an deireadh seachtaine bh&iacute; m&eacute; i gCeantar na nOile&aacute;n i gConamara le roinnt ionadaithe eile &oacute;n gceantar.

These bridges are a key part of the local infrastructure on which local people rely heavily.  I saw the cracks in these bridges and I am deeply disturbed by this.  I have previously highlighted in this Chamber the very dangerous nature of roads in Connemara and the need for adequate investment in them.  We must use next year as an opportunity to fix these dangerous cracks in our public infrastructure.<\/p> <p> We must also put sufficient resources into our public amenities.  A fantastic example of such a public amenity is the outdoor pool in Ros Muc, which has given much joy to the people of the area over the years, but unfortunately the pool has a number of issues that need to be fixed to make it usable again.  This pool would be a fantastic resource and safe amenity for people of all ages, including people learning to swim.  As we move from 2020 to 2021, we need to fix the cracks in our infrastructure and ensure we put adequate resources into capital investment projects because we know of the fantastic benefit they have in job creation.  We also need to deal with very real cracks in our infrastructure.  I hope the roads and bridges of Connemara are not forgotten once more.<\/p> <p> This year has been a very tough year for us all.  We need to regard 2021 as an opportunity to reimagine what this State can be and the role the State can play to provide sufficient housing, a robust healthcare system and public amenities.  The restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 in 2020 have given us some time to reimagine what kind of society we want to live in.  Let us use that time of reflection to build a better and fairer society for us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700030#DD00300","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608211800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta labhairt ar an mBille seo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu.

Over a decade ago &euro;1.2 million was spent on this project, but since then it has been left idle.  Work has stalled since 2014.  It is ready to go and has planning permission.  Previous commitments were made by the Department and all that is needed now is the funding and the fulfilment of those commitments.  I am glad that the Minister of State has agreed to come to Donegal on 5 and 6 January when he will meet a delegation from Finn Harps.  I ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to take this as an example of a shovel-ready project that can generate employment and is a social good, and ensure that the &euro;1.2 million already spent by the Department is not wasted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700031#EE00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1608211800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>While we are on the issue of League of Ireland football clubs, I wish Finn Harps well with its stadium project.  It is a great club in Donegal and the north west.  I have made many unsuccessful journeys up there as a Drogheda United fan over the years, having been beaten on a number of occasions by Finn Harps.  I take this opportunity to notify the Minister that Drogheda United has its own plans to develop a stadium in the northern environs of our town, a town that hopeful will become a city in the future given its size.<\/p><p>Much of that will be dependent on an imminent decision from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a &euro;70 million investment applied for by Louth County Council to develop some very significant infrastructure on the northern side of Drogheda which will allow lands to be opened up for housing and economic development in the future to link the M1 to Drogheda Port.  As the Minister will be aware, that port has ambitions to develop a new deepwater facility just north of Balbriggan and close to Gormanston.  That is a matter for another day and will be considered in the context of the planning process and other factors.<\/p><p>I put the Minister on notice that Drogheda United and the FAI, no doubt, will be making approaches to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its line Department for support for the Drogheda United stadium project at some point in the near future.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is an annual requirement on the legislative calendar and gives the authority of the D&aacute;il for all the spending undertaken this year based on the various Estimates prepared by Departments in 2020.  As the Minister pointed out, this involves expenditure of just under &euro;70 billion, an increase of &euro;15 billion on last year.  Because of the pandemic and the extraordinary response to this unprecedented public health and economic crisis, spending this year and into next year bears little comparison with 2019.  As we all know, the Bill when passed will also allow the Government to continue to spend within the four fifths limit on services and State payments into 2021 before the House gets to vote on the 2021 Estimates in due course.<\/p><p>We all remember the position we were in earlier this year where Estimates had to be presented again and again in revised format and D&aacute;il sanction was required almost on an emergency basis time and time again to provide the Government with the power and authority to allocate moneys to schemes that would otherwise have breached the allowable expenditure ceiling and before the Estimates more generally were dealt with.<\/p><p>The Labour Party united behind the Government to endorse the necessary injections of cash into businesses and in support of jobs, livelihoods and public services at a time of unprecedented crisis for our citizens.  However, we have been very critical of the <i>de facto<\/i>suspension of many of the robust budgetary oversight practices that we have come to expect and demand in recent years in the presentation of Government spending plans.  The Minister knows that exceptions were made this year and that the D&aacute;il would not be inclined to show the same kind of patience and understanding if that were to happen again next year.  The lack of transparency and key information on outputs and performances at times in 2020 was troubling.  I hope as a once-off it is explained by the crisis that the country faced.  I think the Minister understands and accepts that.<\/p><p>It is also very important that the D&aacute;il is not just seen as a rubber stamp for Estimates and Government spending.  In my view and that of international experts, this Parliament's role in the annual budget and Estimates process is comparatively weak by international standards.  This needs work and is an area that we will all be able and willing to contribute to in terms of D&aacute;il reform.<\/p><p>I will limit my remarks on the Bill at this stage.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to comment more on the carry over on the capital side from this year.  Obviously, much of it is explained by the crisis situation that we have been in for the bulk of 2020, but I ask the Minister to elaborate on the Departments that have been most impacted by the crisis.  My sense is that we will not be anywhere near meeting our targets for this year, for example, in respect of social housing new builds, and that is worrying.  We all understand the circumstances and there were periods of time when building sites were not operating, which has caused delays.  That is entirely understandable.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on where the key pressure points are and how he expects and plans to expedite projects which were delayed this year next year.

The only response I ever received was from the former Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, in 2005, when he provided me with the annual costs from 1996 onwards.  I cannot even get that much from the Minister in a reply to a parliamentary question because of the interference of the Ceann Comhairle regarding Vote 15, which was previously Vote 12.  This Vote is contained in the group of Estimates and Votes which fall under the Minister's remit and it is bizarre that sums granted under Vote 15 for the Secret Service are regarded as public expenditure rather than expenditure on justice, foreign affairs or defence.  The fact that it does not exist, is not accountable and still manages to spend &euro;2 million annually is even more bizarre.  Perhaps in his concluding remarks, the Minister could confirm for the public whether he is the head of Ireland's MI5, KGB or CIA, or who, in fact, is.  The only glimpse of the true purpose of the Secret Service Vote of &euro;2 million annually came in a note which appeared inbox in 2009.  It stated that the purpose of the Secret Service Vote is to obtain information which is necessary for the security of the country and that given the sensitivities associated with a Vote of this nature, information relating to its operation is not made public.  So much for transparency.<\/p>  <p>  This all has the hallmarks of a spoof spy film, although it is serious because there is money involved.  Maybe the Minister is being protected by the Ranger wing at a secret international auction, bidding for classified, confidential documents.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste could help the Minister, or perhaps he would be bidding against him, given his skills with confidential documents.  I ask the Minister to ensure that at some point there is a discussion about this expenditure of Irish money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700032#FF00200","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1608212400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>On one issue, I am not sure it is appropriate to refer to interference by the Ceann Comhairle.

Maybe the Minister will echo that response.<\/p>  <p>  This end-of-year accounting exercise, as it is being presented, is quite a fascinating and perhaps eye-watering discussion.  This is everything.  It is all the money - the billions of euro that were spent, and will be spent in January, across all Departments, current and capital.  It is worth reflecting on a very important macro economic point.  It has been a point of dispute and debate over the past decade or two and ,indeed, a matter of dispute and debate in what is often called an ideological discussion, namely, what is a legitimate economic strategy.  Some people want to pretend there was no crash at all in 2008 and that it was all just a bad dream about bank bailouts, bondholders and gambling banks and the austerity that followed and that we should just forget about it and imagine that it did not happen.  A much more serious debate would be to ask whether we have learned something from the contrast between the approach that was taken in the post-2008 period in response to an economic cataclysm and the approach taken in the past year in the face of Covid-19.  We really should let that lesson sink in.  In 2008, faced with an economic cataclysm, we made a decision to bail out the senior bondholders, the global and international investors who had financed banks, gambled on property and crashed the economy.  Working people were asked to pay the bill.  The consequence was dire hardship and austerity.  The long-term legacy was a housing crisis that is still with us, a public health service that is chronically understaffed and teetered on the brink at the beginning of this pandemic and a decade-long recession.  This time around, under pressure because the people would not have taken it again, we made a different decision.  It was decided, to some degree at least, to bail out working people, support them and to invest additional expenditures in public health services, in housing, etc.  We should look at the net effect of things we were told were impossible in the period after 2008, that were \"fantasy economics\".  God almighty, I remember that phrase being repeated endlessly.  It was fantasy economics, for us, as we did in budget submission after budget submission, to propose adjustments upwards in current and capital expenditure of &euro;10 billion to &euro;20 billion for health services, etc.  Yet, here, in this Appropriation Bill, we have precisely that.  There is &euro;17 billion in additional expenditure, which we were told was a fantasy before.  What was the consequence of that?  It sustained the country through an extremely difficult pandemic, which we are still going through, and it produced economic growth.  It did not produce a decade-long recession; it produced economic growth.  <\/p>  <p>  One would think that lesson would be absorbed and that people would put up their hands and say they got it wrong the last time, that approach was a disaster, they made a bad situation worse and they would learn the lessons of what happened in the past year.  Indeed, there was some rhetoric to that effect from both the previous Government and the current Government that perhaps we would learn the lessons and that we had learned who was important, who was essential, what was the front line that protected us all and that Covid might be the springboard for a different type of future in which we would bail out and support the things that really mattered when the chips were down and we would recognise the critical importance of our front-line health workers and of supporting workers' incomes and jobs when things got tough economically.  That was the rhetoric; the new normal.  We were not going back to the old normal; we were going forward to the new normal.  However, it has not taken long to revert to type.<\/p>  <p>  The best example of that concerns health workers.  As the applause of March and April fades into memory, what does the Government do to reward the front-line healthcare workers?<\/p> <p>Where was the bonus payment that some countries gave to their healthcare workers for their extraordinary sacrifice and work in the face of the pandemic, which they continue to do?  This is not history because they will be doing it again in January.  Owing to the Government's Covid strategy we will be facing into further spikes in January and those front-line healthcare workers will be faced with similar situations in January and February.  They got no bonus and they are still working free hours under the Croke Park agreement.  <\/p> <p> The other issue is the student nurses and midwives who were briefly rewarded with the healthcare assistant pay rate and then had the rug pulled from under them when, in the quiet of the summer in August, the Government stopped paying them.  These are, by the way, the student and nurses we are going to need again when the almost inevitable spike in Covid-19 cases comes in January and February and infection rates among healthcare workers start to climb again, and the numbers are already shockingly high.  We will be needing those student nurses and midwives to hold together our health services but the Government expects them to do it for free.  To my mind, that is a scandal.  It speaks to a longer term problem.  If there was any real learning of the lessons of the last while, it is that we need permanent increases in the capacity of our health service, which is chronically understaffed and under-resourced.  To achieve that, we should be treating our healthcare workers with the utmost respect, financially rewarding and remunerating them for the work they do and trying to encourage them not to leave this country, as 71% of student nurses and midwives are likely to do because the conditions in which they have to work are so poor, their pay is poor and the cost of accommodation is out of reach in terms of the salaries they receive.  It seems those lessons are not learned.<\/p> <p> It is particularly worth dwelling on these appropriations.  This morning, the T&aacute;naiste referred to those people who come over the hill to Debenhams workers and tell them there is a pot of money that does not exist.  This is such a pot of money.  It is massive.  It is an enormous pot of money, but one that provides for grossly inflated salaries for taoisigh, special advisers, Ministers, Ministers of State and people in State agencies earning hundreds of thousands of euro, but nothing for nurses except, perhaps, a &euro;50 allowance.  That is the reality in terms of what is provided for in this Appropriation Bill.  The cost that we bear from an Exchequer point of view in regard to HAP is shocking, as pointed out by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, report of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is massively higher than if we were delivering public housing directly, and yet the Government continues along that path and we continue to allow people to be evicted, as some people will be over the coming weeks because the Government has lifted the eviction ban.  When those people are evicted because the vulture landlords want to raise rents and make more profit, they will turn up at the local authority offices looking for homeless HAP, which will cost a hell of a lot more.  It seems the promise that we were going to learn the existential lessons of the year of Covid for the future have been quickly forgotten as we move towards the beginning of 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700032#FF00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608213000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being hear earlier but I expected the Government speakers who are listed to be here and I did not realise they were not.<\/p><p>I am happy to support the Appropriations Bill 2020.  Given the year that is in it, any kind of comparisons are fairly meaningless.  It has been an exceptional year.  Many decisions were taken about spending, most of them correct but some of them questionable.  It is important that as we approach the end of the year consideration is given to how those decisions were taken.  <\/p><p>As I said, most of the decisions were correct.  We had to provide income support for people and supports for businesses in a situation which was completely unprecedented and catastrophic for many individuals and companies.  We also had an enormous spend in the health area, which needs attention at this point.  Earlier this morning, I said here that I completely appreciate the fact that people were under enormous pressure and we did not know what was coming at us from down the tracks as we followed the experience in Italy.  There was a mad scramble to get equipment, personal protective equipment, PPE, and medications and to procure beds and so on.  Initially, there was a scramble and mad rush.  Decisions were taken during that period that I think were questionable.  Whatever about that point in March, there should have been lessons learned.  While at that point there may have been some justification for bypassing the usual financial controls, we needed to get back on track sooner than we did.  There still is no assurance that we are back on track in terms of proper procurement and adherence to existing financial controls.<\/p><p>This morning, I raised with the T&aacute;naiste the awarding of a &euro;14 million contract for ventilators to a company that had no expertise in the area.  The company's only experience is in festival organisation in the Middle East.  It is an events management company whose only employee is the owner and its address is a residential apartment in Dublin city centre.  I queried how it came about that a contract was awarded to this individual.  The T&aacute;naiste undertook to check records and come back to me with information in that regard.  It is important that we have that information.  It beggars belief that a decision like that could have been taken.  In terms of those ventilators, we do not know where they are now.  We know that there were serious issues with quality control and that they have not been used in a clinical setting, as told to us by Paul Reid.  Other than that, we have no idea how many of them arrived in this country, where they are and what action is being taken to get back some of that money for the Irish taxpayer.  There a many outstanding questions like that.  We have that information, thanks to the investigative journalism, principally, of Cianan Brennan of the<i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and, also, because the issue was raised in an RT&Eacute; programme last week, but we do not have answers to those questions.<\/p><p>Whatever about taking short cuts earlier in the year, I am concerned that that practice continued.  There is a report in today's, or, perhaps, yesterday's, <i>The New York Times<\/i>on some of the very questionable practices in the UK and political involvement in the awarding of contracts, with no proper procurement procedures followed and no controls in place.  It was a jamboree for many politicians whose business contacts, family or friends, ended up being awarded very valuable contracts without any of the normal procedures being followed.  We do not want that situation to arise here.  We do not know whether there has been element of it here, or not.  There should have been much greater control from an earlier stage.  By mid-summer, we should have been in a situation where all of the normal controls kicked back in.  We have no assurance as to whether that happened or not.<\/p><p>From the point of view of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its oversight role, in the health area in particular, what is the view at this point in regard to the expenditure of such a vast amount of money?  Is the Minister confident that the proper controls were in place over recent months and are in place now?  Irrespective of emergency situations, we must adhere to proper financial controls.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response from the point of view of his Department and the oversight group in regard to health expenditure.<\/p> <p> Apart from that example, I also raised questions about the whole issue of personal protective equipment, PPE.  From a very early stage, the State had to acquire vast quantities of PPE.  I remember that Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE, gave an estimate at the time that PPE expenditure would be in the region of &euro;1 billion this year.  I understand it has not quite got to that yet.  There will also be a very substantial investment in it next year.  Rather than heading off all around the world trying to locate this equipment, we should be doing things differently.  I recognise that this was a very difficult task in the early days.  I remember proposing at the time, and Paul Reid said it was being done, that given the level of expenditure expected this year, next year and possibly in future years on the whole area of PPE, why were we not manufacturing it ourselves.  That expenditure of &euro;1 billion could create a massive industry and provide jobs for people who have lost out in other areas.  It makes absolute sense that we would bring into use the manufacturing facilities that we have around the country, many of which are lying idle, to train people to produce PPE.  I was given an assurance at the time, last April or May, that arrangements would be made for the manufacture of PPE here.  Has that happened?  Has a new industry been developed and are we producing our own PPE?  When we consider the massive amount of money involved, there should be a spin-off for Irish jobs.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response in this regard.<\/p> <p> As we look to move forward, we undoubtedly have serious issues around procurement in a general sense.  There were serious problems even before the Covid crisis.  The Office of Government Procurement was set up with the intention of dealing with those issues, yet we see all of the same mistakes being repeated in respect of the national paediatric hospital, for example, and broadband provision.  There is a weariness and a lack of confidence that we are capable, as a State, of delivering major infrastructural projects on budget and on time.  While I recognise that this has been achieved in respect of roads projects, for instance, and some transport projects, in the case of other major infrastructural projects, we are not there yet or anywhere close to it.  I am concerned that the expertise does not exist currently within the public sector.  The Minister really needs to review the procurement procedures, the level of expertise that is available and the number of personnel.  A very specialised expertise is required, which very few people have.  We really need to bring it into service in this country because we have not been well served in this regard in the past.<\/p> <p> In terms of moving forward with major capital projects, I urge the Minister to take on board the points other speakers have made in regard to housing.  The provision of housing is central to the cost of living and that, in turn, is central to demands for wage increases and general affordability of living.  We have to bring down the cost of housing and we must stop subsidising overpriced housing.  We have to bring to an end long-term leases, the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and public private partnerships, PPPs, because they just do not work.  We should be building housing at the cost of building, which is approximately &euro;250,000 per three-bedroom house.  It has been done by the co-operative in Ballymun.  If we provide the land, and there is plenty of public land, we can deliver housing at that affordable price.  I urge the Minister to take on board the points raised on that issue and also in regard to health facilities.  Building community healthcare facilities is part and parcel of Sl&aacute;intecare and they will, in turn, result in a lower-cost model of care.  We desperately need to move to a lower-cost, more effective public model of care.  I urge the Minister to give priority to those key areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700033#GG00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608213600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I want to raise the need for capital expenditure to be provided this year for the building of a hospital on the north side of Cork city.

One of them is a project to develop Bridge Street and Linenhall Street in Dundalk, which is a continuity of a piece of work that has already started on Clanbrassil Street and the St. Nicholas Quarter.  This work is an absolute necessity for the town and for ensuing it is not left with what sometimes happens in this State, namely, half a job.  It needs to be completed and it does not necessarily need huge money to do so.  The other project, the port access northern cross route, has been championed by my constituency colleague, Deputy Munster, for many years.  It was referred to earlier by Deputy Nash.  It is a huge project that will cost more than &euro;70 million, but it is an absolute necessity for the development of Drogheda.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I remind the Minister that we have been promised a primary care centre for Dundalk.

I am sure he will receive widespread support in that regard but not without reservation from many of us in the House.  He highlighted the scale of spending this year and the facility to provide &euro;10.8 billion in capital expenditure in 2021.  That is a mind-boggling figure when one thinks of the past number of years when the State was trying to close the budget deficit gap from a couple of billion euro down to &euro;1 billion or so and then down to &euro;500 million.  Before Covid came along, we were running a very tight ship.  All of a sudden, in the year that is just ending and in the year to come, we are, and will be, borrowing very extensively.  Deputy Shortall highlighted the difficulties that has brought in terms of making sure we are spending well and strategically, that we have good procurement procedures and that we are getting value for money.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the Covid crisis sprang incredible surprises on our economy, on the healthcare sector, in particular, and on the Government.  There were a lot of decisions to be made, many of which we probably would not make again if we were looking at them a second time around.  It is interesting that Deputy Shortall highlighted the ventilators issue.  I had some dealings with HSE procurement over the past year on behalf of companies that were looking to supply products and medicines to Covid supports.  It was incredibly difficult to get any engagement at all from the HSE.  During my time on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, I brought up the difficulty of trying to get access to key decision makers.<\/p> <p>Deputy Shortall was alluding to people with commercial interests who were trying to make these contacts.  I know many people who were trying to make these contacts because they had the interests of the country in mind and at heart, people who had widespread contacts in the Far East for the procurement of personal protective equipment, PPE, who offered their services and were not called upon.  There are lessons to be learned about that.<\/p> <p> We are also still going through the issues of Brexit, which are very significant for the country.  One of the things that we know is that, whatever way the Brexit deal rolls out, we are going to have a very different relationship with the UK afterwards.  We are certainly going to have some very significant transport issues.  Within that we have seen the issues of the UK land bridge potentially being bypassed in trying to get direct access to the European Continent.  Thankfully, services are going to start from Rosslare Europort through DFDS but I have not heard anything about Government capital supports for Rosslare Europort nor for the Port of Waterford, which is a bulk port.  The south east has the fastest sea routes to the European Continent and I cannot understand why I am not hearing from Government about initiatives to support additional scaling of services from these ports.  That is something that the Minister needs to incorporate in his planning.<\/p> <p> On health planning, I brought up with the T&aacute;naiste this morning and with the Taoiseach last week the issue of a second catheterization laboratory.  I remind the Minister that we are now into the fourth calendar year in terms of the delivery of a &euro;5 million capital spend.  At present, we have been going through a four-month Office of Government Procurement review of a &euro;5 million spend.  I compare that with the decision that was made earlier this year to provide &euro;350 million in surge capacity under a private hospital contract deal, a deal I believe that was brokered in less than three weeks.<\/p> <p> Again, we must look at how we are doing our business.  It will largely fall to the Minister&rsquo;s Department in the coming year to provide oversight for this money, but we cannot say that on the one hand that we are going to be looking at all of the minutiae of spending for a &euro;5 million deal while, on the other, when it comes to a deal worth tens of millions of euro, we ask how somebody with no expertise in the area could be awarded such a contract for &euro;14 million.  These are issues that will have to be looked at.<\/p> <p> From my own perspective, while I do not want to get into pork barrel politics, I want to mention some issues on both regional and national development.  It has now been properly recognised that we need major funding within the mental health sector.  We have a very poor service in the south east in child and adult mental health supports, certainly in the community.  There is none in University Hospital Waterford and we are totally dependent on the child and adult mental health services in Cork University Hospital, CUH.  We were promised a block for this service.<\/p> <p> We have a problem with hospital groups, and I have said this before.  We have money being channelled into one central position.  The money is supposed to be given from that on an equitable basis, but all we need do is look at where University Hospital Kerry in Tralee is at the moment or where University Hospital Waterford has been in their efforts at trying to get funding from the centre.  As I said this morning, an announcement of 12 new consultant posts was made by the HSE in Waterford recently which have not even been approved yet by the Consultant Applications Advisory Committee, so these will be a minimum of 12 months to two years away.  Why announce these?  We need to get away from this spin.<\/p> <p> I have thanked the Minister on previous occasions for the funding for the North Quays in Waterford, but that will not be the driver in closing the gap in GDP for the south east and making up the ground we have lost.  That will largely be in the education sector.  We need significant capital moneys to be given to the third level sector.  I am aware that the technological university for the south east is being discussed at present.  That has to be of the quantum and scale that is required to drive the south east.  We do not have a national university in the south east, unlike all the other regions of the country.  Therefore, we need this to solve that education deficit problem.  I hope that will be given the attention it requires.<\/p> <p> Housing has been mentioned before.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement recently on the affordable housing scheme but we need to understand that there is a very significant number of people who have fallen into the trap of being outside of any support from the local authority and yet who are finding it impossible to save and get on to the property ladder.  I agree with some of the previous Deputies that we have to get back to local authorities providing some housing mix and not just handing tenders over here and there.  We had that expertise years ago and it can be developed again.  We need to look at that.<\/p> <p> Most important in terms of this &euro;10.8 billion allocation, we will need to see transparent and equitable decision-making in respect of it.  We can no longer have these out-of-the-blue announcements that something is going to be funded for &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million because this creates disharmony in the State.  Now more than ever and post Covid-19, we will have to work together and we are all in this together.  I plead with the Minister to secure the tangible assets of our State into the future.  I am thinking of our agricultural sector and of our aviation sector, which has taken an incredible hammering.  We are going to need that sector to get back up and going.  Our enterprise and innovation sectors also need to be supported in the areas of technology and communications, together with our arts and culture.<\/p> <p> It is to be hoped we can get back to supporting these sectors, but what I want to see most of all after this Bill has been passed and in the new year is a more transparent way of doing business, with evidence-based research to back up what we are doing in achieving value for money in the processes that we are undertaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700034#HH00400","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608214200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Sh&iacute;l m&eacute; go raibh m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama.

It is to put the Vote on a statutory footing and to carry over the capital and I fully support that.  I could not let this opportunity go, however, without adding my voice to those voices that said that we need a transformative change in the way that we do business.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 was the opportunity to do that.  It challenged us to do it, and for a little while I dared to hope that that was what was going to happen.  The Government did the right thing and we in this D&aacute;il unanimously supported the measures on the various schemes that were brought in.  We had a sense of solidarity that was just something to behold.  We did, unfortunately, undo that sense of solidarity by telling 70-year-olds to stay at home and so on, and led them to believe that they had no choice.  By and large we inculcated a sense of solidarity, that we were all in this together, that somebody who had Covid-19 was not alone and that we were there with him or her to change things.  I had that moment of hope.  I also had that moment of hope on climate change that we finally saw the light.  As more time goes on I am losing that sense of hope, which I do not like.<\/p>  <p>  We have no choice but to take different types of actions.  We have a major housing crisis.  I know that the Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il are aware of this but they are still persisting with language in terms of social housing which is not social housing.  I want to avoid that word completely and talk about public housing.  We need to provide public housing for all our citizens and residents.  That is the only way.  We have different schemes within that, such as cost rental schemes and local authority houses, but we need to have public housing.  Without that message going out to the market, we are going to go from crisis to crisis.  It is difficult to watch the amount of public money involved, which is in excess of &euro;1 billion this year, I understand.  I knew that figure was coming because I sat on the Committee of Public Accounts for four and a half years and it was a complete education.  It was a privilege to be there and to learn and we saw where the money was going.  Unfortunately, I always had a sense of frustration because we were looking back at where the mistakes were made.  I wondered at what stage we would learn.<\/p>  <p>  We all make mistakes and I am not going to haul somebody over the coals for making mistakes, but it is about the learning from those mistakes.  We should have learned by now that the market cannot be left unregulated.  The market is not there to provide a home for people, it is there to make a profit.  I am sorry if this is old hat but the strong narrative from the Government has to be challenged by the few voices in this Chamber that challenge it in a constructive and positive way.  We need public housing.  We need the market, of course, and private landlords, but as a help to our housing, not as the main player in the game.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, that is what we have done.  That is what happened with the housing assistance payment legislation.  Therefore, we need to examine the housing legislation very soon and change the provisions on the housing assistance payment.  Rent supplement was a temporary measure to assist people.  The housing assistance payment became a permanent solution.  Many of my colleagues in the D&aacute;il and I spent a long time as members of local authorities.  We were told repeatedly that the housing assistance payment was the only game in town and that there was nothing else.  Once a person took that payment, he or she came off the waiting list.  I recall being told I was a liar when I said that.  At the time, I was a lawyer.  I recall saying there might be very little difference between the two but that there was a difference and that I was not lying.  The housing assistance payment was considered to be a social housing payment.  The recipient was regarded as adequately housed even though he or she was in a private house with absolutely no security of tenure and so on.  We are persisting with that model.  I realise we cannot change it overnight.  There is no way we can do so but at least let us decide that it is not the solution and that we need public housing.<\/p> <p> The rain came into two hospital operating theatres in my city in 2017 but one of them has still not been put right.  I cannot remember the figure precisely but I believe there were over 6,000 waiting on the outpatient waiting list to be seen by an orthopaedic surgeon.  There were thousands on the inpatient waiting list waiting for surgery, in a city that has two private hospitals where nobody waits.<\/p> <p> At some stage, we need to decide, and push the Government to decide, what a civilised society is and the best way to inculcate a healthy society.  It is by providing basic public services and enshrining them in the Constitution.  The right to a home has to be enshrined in the Constitution as soon as possible.  It is the most basic right that allows for security of tenure and allows people to participate in society.  We need a public health system based on need, not profit.  We need balanced regional development.<\/p> <p> Various organisations, such as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, have told us that we need public infrastructure.  I do not know how many economists have finally found the courage to say we need public infrastructure.  Now is the time to build.  Doing so creates employment but it also deals with our problems.  That is not happening.  In Galway, we are crying out for a hospital.  I do not expect the Minister to tell me we are going to get one but I am simply saying it is needed.  We have been waiting for an accident and emergency unit for years.  Prior to the 2016 election, those who have now served as taoisigh told us it was not fit for purpose.  Here we are, in the 21st-century, going into 2021, and we are still waiting for an accident and emergency unit.  We are still waiting for two theatres to be put back into action four years after they were closed.  A brand-new hospital could have been built in the meantime.  We have 180 acres of land at Merlin Park and we have a city that is being choked by traffic.  Is as Gaillimh m&eacute; agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir a bheith n&iacute;os br&oacute;d&uacute;la as an gcathair n&aacute; m&eacute; ach t&aacute; easpa strucht&uacute;ir ann &oacute; thaobh tr&aacute;chta de.  We are choked with traffic because of bad planning decisions, some of which were instigated by councillors.  The planners were very often on the side of the angels in regard to planning decisions.  Since then, management has persisted in not coming up with a sustainable solution.  We have never rolled out park-and-ride facilities.  The population of the city is destined to grow by 50%.  In such a city, we have never rolled out park-and-ride facilities.  It has been in the city development plan since 2005.  I had the privilege, as mayor, of putting it in the plan.  At the time, management fought us tooth and nail.  The councillors led the way.  Fifteen years later, we have no park-and-ride facilities in Galway.  We have no integrated school transport system.  We have some school transport in the city and some in the rural areas that should be expanded.  We are currently telling people not to use public transport, which is most unfortunate.  I do not know how we are going to gain their trust again but we should be preparing for that time because of climate change.<\/p> <p> Luiagh my colleague from Galway, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, Conamara agus an easpa infreastrucht&uacute;ir out there.  Ros a Mh&iacute;l is crying out to be developed.  In any planned infrastructure project, it should be Ros a Mh&iacute;l that is developed, in partnership with Galway city.  Galway city has a planning application for the docks before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Although I am no expert, it makes no sense to me that we are going to develop Galway, which is tidal, at an extraordinary cost, and not touch Ros a Mh&iacute;l, which has deep-sea facilities and is in the heart of the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p> We should be considering light rail for Galway.  It is a hobbyhorse of mine but I fundamentally believe in it.  Two years ago, I stood on the streets of Galway with a dedicated group to address this.  No member of the group was political in the sense of belonging to a political party, as far as I know.  Twenty-four thousand people signed a petition requesting that a feasibility study on light rail be considered so we could see whether it is possible.  If it is not possible, so be it.  There has been no action since then.  A feasibility study is the most basic thing we should have.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is to make a difference in government, it should consider a feasibility study on light rail for Galway city.  It should have balanced regional development.<\/p> <p> I really appreciate the money that is being given to businesses and employees.  The pandemic unemployment payment was the best thing that happened but it has not led to transformative change.<\/p> <p> I mentioned Inishbofin either this morning or yesterday.  It is struggling to get a primary care centre.  On the Aran Islands, through pressure, and rightly so, the airport has now been bought.  I pay tribute to both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in regard to that matter but everything has to be fought for rather than having a policy and realising the better way to do things in the long run.  From my experience having been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I believe it is the cheaper way to do things because if we do not proceed in that way, we end up paying millions of euro in fines and in cleaning up.  Consider the amount of money we are using to clean up former quarries and extraction facilities and so on.  It is unbelievable.<\/p> <p> I am glad I have had the opportunity to contribute to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700035#JJ00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608214800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I appreciate the contributions of all Deputies across the House.  I will just make some brief remarks in response.  It will not be possible to cover the very wide range of points that have been made by colleagues.  I thank colleagues for their support for this vital legislation, which is to provide a sound legal basis for the expenditure incurred in 2020.  It also allows for the continuation of expenditure into 2021 prior to the passing by this House of the Estimates for 2021.<\/p><p>There are a few common themes in the various subjects the Deputies have raised.  Capital expenditure was dealt with extensively by a number of Deputies, who quite understandably took the opportunity to raise projects and needs in various areas.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell referred to Conamara's roads and bridges, Deputy Doherty referred to the development of Finn Harps, Deputy Nash referred to the Drogheda United development plans, and Deputy Shanahan raised a number of issues concerning Waterford and the wider south-east region.  The offer I would make to individual Deputies is that I will work with them in respect of individual projects they want to see developed.  We have a review of the national development plan under way.  I encourage everyone to participate as part of the public consultation phase, which is now open.  Information thereon is available on <i>www.gov.ie\/2040<\/i>.  Public submissions are possible right up to late January.  It is a really important opportunity for members of the public, stakeholders, civic society groups and representative bodies from across the country to have their say on the direction of capital investment in the country over the next decade.  By quarter 2 of next year, the intention is to adopt what will essentially be a new ten-year national development plan for the period to 2030.  It will have to be consistent with Project Ireland 2040, the overarching spatial strategy for the development of our country and with the priorities in the programme for Government on tackling climate change and investing in transport, housing, healthcare, education and so on.<\/p> <p>Reforms will be introduced as part of the review of the national development plan to address our ability to deliver the public capital investment programme.  There will be strengthened oversight in respect of individual projects.  External experts will be involved in making critical decisions during the life cycle of individual projects.  We are also reviewing the capacity of the public sector to deliver on those major public capital programmes.  It is a comprehensive review.  We will be looking at the overall quantum of money required to deliver a national development plan over the next decade and assessing the different priorities, including some of the issues my colleagues have raised this afternoon, such as balanced regional development and many other areas.  That is an important issue to highlight.<\/p> <p> The issue of underspending was raised by a number of Deputies.  This was a year like no other.  The delivery of major construction projects was, understandably, impacted by the shutdown earlier in the year.  Deputy Nash asked where the pressures are.  The overall underspend in capital was almost &euro;900 million and more than &euro;200 million of that was in the area of housing.  Construction was shut down for a number of months and that has had an impact on the delivery of the public housing programme.  There has been an underspend in the region of &euro;150 million in transport.  On the capital side of the health budget, there has been an underspend of more than &euro;100 million.  The Deputy can see how those numbers add up in the context of the overall underspend.  It should be put in perspective.  The original budget for the 2020 capital investment programme was &euro;8.2 billion and the final allocation, including extra allocations that were made over the course of the year, was almost &euro;9.9 billion and the outturn is expected to be &euro;9.3 billion.  That is still more than &euro;1 billion more than the original allocation for capital budgets in 2020.  It is important to make that point.  The vast majority of the amount that has been underspent will be carried forward into 2021 under the provisions that are available in the legislation.  That will bring our programme next year to approximately &euro;10.8 billion, which is a record level in the history of the State and it is important to say that.<\/p> <p> A number of colleagues emphasised the need for investment in public housing and the public health service.  That is exactly what we are seeking to do.  For example, the plan for next year is to build 9,500 public houses in our country.  The last year that we have complete data for is 2019, when approximately 6,500 public housing units were built.  The ambition and funding are available to increase that to 9,500 next year.  That will be part of an overall addition to the social housing stock of approximately 12,750.  We absolutely want to see a shift in emphasis towards building public housing.  That is what my party has done through the decades and we are determined to put the emphasis on direct delivery and direct building of public housing by approved housing bodies and local authorities.  We will see significant progress in that area over the period ahead.  I will be working closely with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in that space.<\/p> <p> I will take up the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett in asking what is different from a decade ago.  The reality is that we are now in a position to access funding and that has allowed us to bring forward the type of response which simply was not available a decade ago, as Deputy Howlin knows all about.  We are in a position to borrow at historically low interest rates and the right thing to do now is to pursue counter-cyclical policies.  Governments have not always had the opportunity to adopt such an approach.  The truth is that these exceptional policies at European Central Bank, ECB, level will not be continued indefinitely.  We welcome the statement from the ECB earlier this week to the effect that its bond-buying programme will now be extended through until March 2022.  That is positive news but we will, over time, have to ensure that our public finances are on a sustainable path.  That is about ensuring that we are borrowing for capital purposes and not for current purposes and, ultimately, moving towards a deficit of less than 3% and a broadly balanced budget.  In the April stability programme update the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I will publish in April 2021, we will set out the pathway and trajectory as to how we achieve that.<\/p> <p> I draw the attention of Members to the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2021 published this week.  It is important that we learn from our experience of public expenditure in 2020 and achieve value for money.  It is important to have strict expenditure control mechanisms in place.  There is a wealth of information in the published Revised Estimates for 2021 relating to performance metrics, outputs from different Votes and exactly what the Government expects to be achieved by different Departments in respect of the extraordinary budgets that have been provided for 2021.  In 2020, gross Government expenditure is of the order of &euro;87.3 billion.  If we spend all of the money allocated to the recovery fund and the Covid-19 contingency fund, we have the capacity for an outturn of &euro;87.8 billion in 2021.  We are maintaining an elevated level of public expenditure to support the economy because addressing the legacy unemployment issues from Covid is going to be a top priority for this Government in 2021 and beyond.  We are determined to do that, to support households and businesses and to do all that we can to support our economy in what will remain a challenging time.  We will know the outcome of Brexit in a short period of time.  We also need to improve public services and that is why we have made a step change in investment in the public health system with an increase in funding of &euro;4 billion in 2021.  Those are extraordinary sums, but we need to get a return in respect of them.<\/p> <p> I thank my colleagues for their support for this Bill and look forward to working with them through 2021 as we implement the budget for next year.  I know that the Estimates will be considered at committee level and will ultimately come back into the House to be voted upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700036#KK00200","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608215400,"counter":352,"content":"<p>With the permission of the Minister and that of the House, we will allow Deputy Michael Collins in because he came into the Chamber as the Minister got to his feet.

I sprinted to get here but the Minister had just got to his feet when I arrived.  I appreciate the Minister giving us a full and detailed rundown of the capital funding and the ten-year national development plan ahead.  I plead with him to give serious consideration to a constituency that I feel has been starved of good, serious funding for a long time to allow it to make changes.  We have many issues in west Cork.  The Minister is a fellow Corkman and he was down in west Cork during the summer, as he probably has been often.  I would appreciate it if these issues were looked at in a more serious light.  There is no point in anybody telling me that Cork has got a fair slice of the cake because it has not.<\/p>  <p>  There was &euro;63.5 million of greenway funding announced recently.  It is a great boost to any community to get funding for projects and especially for a constituency like Cork South-West that needs that type of funding.  There are possibilities there, as I have said, in Ballinhassig, Kinsale, Innishannon, down to Mizen Head and up into Beara to create employment in what will be a tough time ahead.  With Brexit and everything, the fishing and farming sectors are going to be hit.  People are going to have to think outside the box for survival.  I appreciate the Minister cannot get projects shovel ready but work is still required on the Innishannon bypass, the Bandon southern relief road and the northern relief road.  Even passing bays on the N71 and the R586 are an example of an issue that has been omitted.<\/p> <p>I said it to the Taoiseach and I say to the Minister that, in the past 20 years, the only progressive work I saw done on the N71 was the opening of the Skibbereen bypass, and that was 18 years ago.  No archway or leeway into a huge constituency like Cork South-West can be starved for 20 years of investment and funding, which would bring us into line with other counties and open up places like Skibbereen and Bantry and far-reaching places like Castletownbere, Schull and Mizen Head.  Innishannon and Bandon are bottlenecks and desperately need funds to be made available either to look at relief roads or passing bays.  A person does not have to be a rocket scientist for some of these works.<\/p> <p> Issues that desperately need funding include the sewerage systems in Belgooly, Ballinspittle, Castletownshend and Goleen.  I mentioned Ballinspittle in a discussion we had in the D&aacute;il last night.  The county development plan allows for 50 or 60 houses there, but they cannot build any house because they cannot increase the capacity of the sewerage system.  It is in such close proximity to Cork.  Castletownshend is probably pumping raw sewage into the sea, the same as places like Goleen, where I come from.  They are areas that need funding and that need to be focused on.  Many feel they have not had that.<\/p> <p> The endoscopy unit promised to Bantry General Hospital has not been delivered.  Bantry hospital serves a catchment of anything up to 80,000 people.  I was canvassing around Bandon and Innishannon and it shocked me when people told me they would not dare turn to Cork University Hospital and that they would love to go and do go to Bantry hospital.  We have to protect areas like that.  Clonakilty Community Hospital has been starved of funding in recent years, which has led to unfortunate situations during Covid.  HIQA reports have made it clear that funding has not been spent there in certain important areas where it should have been spent.  Staff were left with a massive headache.<\/p> <p> I do not want to paint a bleak picture all the time but I have been speaking about these things since 2016 and they need progression.  The Minister might have his finger on the pulse more, being from the county.  I respect that he is a national Minister but my problem is that a lot of good projects in west Cork are being put before the Government.  It might not be very good politically and the Chair might stop me saying this but a lot of nod-and-wink politics seems to go on and the money goes in a certain direction.  Proof of that was the rural regeneration fund.  I called for an independent investigation into where that money was being spent.  That was prior to the Minister taking office.  There were shovel-ready projects that did not get any funding.<\/p> <p> I know one such project in Schull that would have been a game changer and have provided between 60 and 80 jobs, which in a place like Schull would have been incredible. That project was shovel-ready, had planning and everything but got nothing.  It was twice the lead project of Cork County Council and it got zero.  I saw projects that were only aspirational coming near senior Ministers and they were given millions.  Something is wrong somewhere.  Everyone has to push for their own area as best they can but we need to ensure that type of politics does not continue.<\/p> <p> The sad thing is the Schull Harbour project looks like it has been shelved because Cork County Council, in its wisdom, with seven days to go before a decision was to be made, and it was assumed it would put the project forward again because it was shovel ready and there was planning in place, pulled the plug and left the group flat-footed with no lead body going forward.  If that project had happened for Schull, it would have been a massive game changer for the whole of west Cork because tourism is a road we must travel, given the difficulties in the fishing industry, as I said, and the farming industry.<\/p> <p> I have said to the Taoiseach, though it is falling on deaf ears on the moment, that we need to set up a task force in west Cork to look at tourism and areas that have had a complete lack of investment and funding.  I will keep calling for that task force.  If the Taoiseach does not provide it, it is to be hoped that in the next term, when the T&aacute;naiste might be Taoiseach, he will understand where I am coming from.  I can put before the Government 50 or 60 projects that have been there or thereabouts and have been continually refused funding.  A task force is what we need in west Cork in order that there is complete focus on the projects, that the projects are brought before the Ministries where the funding is available, and that we are on a level playing pitch with everybody else, be they in Dublin city, out in Castletownbere or down in Ballinadee or Belgooly.  It should not make a difference but, unfortunately, it has made such.  As a public representative, I have to fight the corner.<\/p> <p> There are many issues with flooding in west Cork.  Skibbereen, Rosscarbery, Bantry and many other places got flooded.  The Minister was down there, as I said, and I appreciate his visit.  Rathbarry and such places need funding.<\/p> <p> The one criticism I had about the funding that became available was that it was not open to 70%, 80% or maybe 90% of the people who desperately needed it.  It was humanitarian aid but there were so many hoops and fences.  If a person had insurance, he or she did not get it.  I know a business that did not have and could not afford insurance that did not get it because it was told it probably could have got insurance.  Some people had insurance with, unfortunately, an excess of maybe &euro;10,000, and they were not able to get it.  Some people's damage could have been &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000.  A huge number of people were affected.  For most of them, their businesses had closed due to Covid and had just reopened.  We were helping them.  There was little in Bandon but a good bit in Bantry, obviously, and I saw the damage and the sheer devastation to businesses.  Many good people, neighbours and friends put their hands to the wheel.  I said at the time that there should have been a stand-alone fund - a very fair and open fund.<\/p> <p> We have done this for years in Ireland.  When places abroad were destroyed with floods or whatever, we were always the ones to send aid abroad but we did not look after ourselves.  We gave a small percentage of people funding and made it look as if they all got it.  I know, because I spoke to them, that they did not all get it.  They could not get it because the criteria were so difficult and teased out.  Businesses and people needed it.  Private individuals could get it for their premises, but they were as bad as the rest in that they might not have been able to afford insurance.  Flooding is an act of God, not of their own negligence.  They only thing they can look out for is if someone will help them.  The public representative is the first person to be asked.  I look at what is there and tell most of them I am sorry but they cannot get anything.  Then there are announcements on TV and radio that there is plenty of money and flooding funding available.<\/p> <p> I want to focus back on west Cork.  The Minister said people should not be pushing their own wheelbarrow, but nobody has been pushing this wheelbarrow.  I would appreciate if the Minister would jump on board the wheelbarrow with me and we will work together.  We cannot get it all done in the number of years the Minister will hold office, but we can get some projects done.  I would greatly appreciate it if he would work with me on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700037#LL00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608216000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Perhaps an Teachta Collins will get a hybrid wheelbarrow.

It is important to articulate on behalf or our constituencies needs which are real and growing.  I welcome the Government initiatives in terms of their investment in the east Meath, south Louth, north Louth and mid-Louth areas.  Some important projects have been completed.<\/p>  <p>Considerable progress has been made at Lourdes hospital in terms of improvements, additional wards and investment in its health infrastructure.  The extension of the DART is an important and major transport project.  I believe it has received adequate funding and that the orders for the construction of the carriages will be issued.  While the project's construction will take a couple of years, it will have important benefits for Drogheda and east Meath.  It will mean that many more people will be able to work in Drogheda and travel from Dublin.  It will also mean that our population centre can grow sustainably.  We talk about sustainability of employment and, where possible, keeping people where they live, but 12,000 commuters leave the Drogheda-south Louth-east Meath area per day, which is a major operation.<\/p> <p> The northern cross route in Drogheda will cost approximately &euro;60 million.  That is how much the county council is requesting.  All political parties in County Louth are united in supporting the project.  It is a matter for the Minister, who is examining all of the options as to where he can and should invest, but Drogheda town is choked by traffic, including port bound traffic.  This morning, large articulated trucks passed through the one-way system in the town centre, holding up everything and trying to get around narrow corners.  As a Government, the most important thing we could do would be to ensure that the northern cross route was constructed.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has visited and is aware of the issues.  He expressed his view on the matter when he was spokesman in opposition.  Since he was in favour of the project then, we hope that he will be in favour of it now.  Let there be no mistake - all parties and Independents want it to happen.<\/p> <p> The Ardee bypass is an essential road infrastructure project.  There is money for it.  The council is trying to address problems that have arisen around Ardee.

It is something that should be taken on board.<\/p><p>The definition of &ldquo;intimate image&rdquo; in section 1(a) above is confined to intimate images of the private body parts of the person himself or herself.  It does not include intimate images of the body parts of strangers, which have been electronically superimposed upon non-intimate images without the knowledge or consent of the person whose image has been altered, or deepfaked.  Deepfaking is a common and harmful form of image-based sexual violence.  This is vitally important because while it may be somebody's face that is on the image but it could be somebody else's body and that is still an abuse and it should be recognised within this legislation.  These amendments seek to cater for that.<\/p><p>I know the Minister, Deputy McEntee, said the Bill already covers this.  I do not believe it does strongly enough and many of the groups that have an interest in this do not believe it is strong enough either.  It is important we strengthen these provisions in the legislation.  Once these images have been created, it is hard or even impossible to take them out of circulation.  We have to have a chilling effect to stop the creation of these images at the start.  If people are aware that they can be prosecuted for creating the images, that might have some impact on them and might go to reducing the volume of the images that are there.  I ask that the Minister of State would take on board one or other of the amendments from this group so that this can be taken into account in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700041#PP00100","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1608217200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I am delighted we have got to this stage of the debate on this important legislation.  I want to thank the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  Unfortunately she cannot be with us but I thank her for her co-operation with me in advancing this legislation to this point.<\/p>  <p>  The net issue in this group of amendments is the definition of \"intimate image\".  We are trying to ensure that the sharing of intimate images without consent is a criminal offence.  Apparently that is a frequent occurrence and there is no legal impediment to it.  It has been pointed out to us by Rape Crisis Network Ireland and a number of other agencies that the definition we originally put in the Bill does not cover all eventualities.  I know we had some discussion on this on Committee Stage.  The intimate images referred to in the Bill cover: \"the person&rsquo;s genitals, buttocks or anal region and, in the case of a female, her breasts\", as enunciated in the interpretation section of the Bill that was passed on Committee Stage.  All of the amendments in this group seek to achieve the same objective.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's amendment strikes me as a simple and neat solution.  Rather than replacing paragraphs of the Bill, he simply wants to insert a few words in the original definition.  Instead of defining an intimate image as I have already mentioned, we should insert before that: \"what is, or purports to be\" an image of a person's genitals and so on.  With Photoshop and the superimposing of images on top of a recognised face, one can equally do significant harm.  In my judgment, this would strengthen the Bill and I hope the Minister of State is in a position to accept one of these amendments.  The neatest and clearest solution would be Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's proposition in amendment No. 5, to insert \"what is, or purports to be\" as well as the actual presentation of a person's genitals and so on.  In other words, this is a superimposed image of genitalia on top of a recognised person.  Unfortunately, that is a practice that apparently does go on and it is something that we should outlaw in this Bill if we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700041#PP00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1608217200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I also welcome the swift passage of this Bill and the progress it has made so far.

All the amendments in this group deal with that in different ways.  As Deputy Howlin said, amendment No. 5 seems to be the simplest measure, except it only suggests that \"what is, or purports to be\" will be inserted in one place.  I am not sure if that will be adequate or if it may need to be inserted somewhere else as well.  I suggest that the Minister of State come back to us on that.  I hope he will be able to progress this and that he will accept that it is sensible to try to ensure there is no loophole for any person who is setting out with the intention to damage another person.

As Women's Aid pointed out, it is not revenge or porn but it is image-based sexual abuse.  We know that for too long victims have had no legal recourse against this damaging form of abuse.  It is thought to effect one-in-eight users of social media, 90% of them being women, with long-term psychological and personal consequences.  Some 80% to 93% of victims suffer: significant emotional distress; feelings of isolation, anger, guilt, paranoia; deterioration in personal relationships; low self-esteem; depression; withdrawal; and even suicide.  Those people, overwhelmingly women, who are effected by the abuse of the character that we are trying to address with this amendment, suffer the exact same consequences.  The consequence of being part of an image which purports to be a person, with one's face superimposed on someone else's body, has the exact same effect.<\/p><p>The Government dragged its feet on this issue for years.  This would not be happening today if it were not for the determined action of women's rights organisations and campaigns and the now almost 81,000 people who have signed Megan Sim's <i>www.change.org<\/i>petition.

The amendments that I and others have suggested at various Stages of this Bill reflect our engagement with victims and survivor groups who took the very brave step to share their personal experiences.<\/p>  <p>  There is a remaining key issue that needs to be addressed in this law.  Deepfaking, that is, making images of fake events, for example, the addition of intimate images of body parts onto photos of a person without the person's knowledge or consent, is a common and very harmful form of image-based sexual abuse.  Once online, such images can be impossible to have removed and, although faked, do real harm to victims and their lives.  To address this specifically, I have been advised that the Minister of State needs to accept any of amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5 or 6.  We are very close to having comprehensive legislation to tackle image-based sexual abuse.  Can we please make that final step and add one of the amendments to provide that reassurance to victims?<\/p>  <p>  We have to look at the larger cultural changes as well.  Over recent weeks, discussions of image-based sexual abuse have involved forms of victim blaming.  The sharing of intimate images without the full consent of the people in them is wrong.  It will soon be a crime and it needs to be treated like that socially too.  We need a zero-tolerance approach.

We recognise that this particular Minister of Justice has prioritised the Bill.  Certainly, in recent weeks, in light of the leadership that has been demonstrated, in particular, by young women on Twitter who have been impacted by this, there has been some rapidity brought to the legislation and we welcome the swiftness with which this is being carried.<\/p>  <p>  We brought the necessary speed needed to enact this legislation following the discovery of thousands of non-consensual images and videos of Irish women and girls being distributed and shared online earlier in November of this year.  Over many years, there has been no legislative protection offered to victims of this crime or punishment to the perpetrators.  It is long past time that that ceased.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that the Bill has been strengthened on Committee Stage in that it now includes the Domestic Violence Act 2018 among the Acts referred to and has a requirement to carry out a review of the operations of the Bill in three years' time.  The amendments I and others have put forward are intended to strengthen the protection of the Bill.  I thank the work of the Victims Alliance and the Rape Crisis Centre for their tireless work they have done engaging with public representatives to improve the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill needs to be future-proofed as much as possible to ensure that it keeps up with technology and recognises that technology currently available is being used to create deepfake intimate images.  Deepfake intimate images, which are images that appear to be intimate images of the person but are not, cannot be separated out from this Bill as they are just as harmful, just as damaging and equally morally reprehensible.  We need to ensure that they are captured in the legislation.  As of September 2019, the artificial intelligence, AI, firm Deeptrace found that there were 15,000 deepfake videos online and 96% of these videos were pornographic.  The technology is becoming more widely accessible and is used almost exclusively for the creation and non-consensual distribution of pornographic images and videos of women and young girls.<\/p>  <p>  The current wording of the Bill refers to images of the person's genitals, buttocks, anal region or breasts.  This, as pointed out by the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, leaves the door open to the defence argument that they are not images of the person's intimate areas that have been altered but are non-intimate images of the person instead, used to create deepfake images which appear to be, but are not, images of the intimate parts of the person's body.  That is a huge gap in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  A wide variety of amendments have been put forward.

If it is an adult putting these things up - a male adult putting pictures of a female up like that - a custodial sentence should be considered in this country.  We have to stop going easy on people who try to wreck other people's lives.  If it is a younger person, we need to look at the education system and how we educate young boys or young children as they grow up to respect and use social media and not use it as a loaded weapon to hurt others.

I am concerned because this morning Deputy Naughten raised an issue about the sexual crimes register not being effective or policed enough with only one check a week.  Is that legislation robust enough to deal with the people we are trying to take off our streets, get off our Internet, stop interfering with our lives and stop making money out of harmful content?<\/p>  <p>  I am friendly with a principal in a large school.  He has told me that everyone blames the schools and puts more work on them.  He is right.  The view often is that no matter what happens, the school should deal with it.  The schools, however, have so many complex issues to deal with.  They do great work and I salute the teachers and the boards of management.  It has to be a holistic evaluation from the cradle to grave.  Young people need to be aware and educated.  Parents and guardians have a significant role and responsibility which is important.<\/p>  <p>  I am certainly aware of girls who get involved in what they think are frivolous activities.  Then, before they know it, it is way out of control and they are offered money by sugar daddies or whatever.  There are huge issues.  One would think it is so simplistic but it is so complex as well.  The Rural Independent Group is supporting this 100%.  I look forward to the Bill's passage and enactment, as well as the Garda being resourced.  It has the units but these must be resourced for it to be totally on top of its game.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the garda&iacute; in Tipperary and elsewhere who looked to join the new sexual crime units.  I wish them much success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700043#RR00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1608218400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Like others, I welcome this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The consensus in the House is we need to do more.

As a public representative, I have dealt with some of these cases.  I have had parents contacting me, particularly in cases involving children, not so much concerning two adults.  It is usually in a school setting and has totally undermined and broken the child it happens to.  Some of the cases involved the child's face superimposed on a graphic picture which went around the whole school.  It often started in the school but ended up in the community.  In some of the cases I know about the Garda was involved.  The cases did not really go anywhere, however.  There is an impact on the family and the victim.  It will live with them for the rest of their days.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest worry that the parents and the victims have is once an image is on the Internet, it is there forever.

It is vital that consent is given to the subject of the image.  Safe Ireland is the national social change agency working to end gender-based violence and it made a lengthy submission.  Other Members have discussed deepfakes.  We have to talk about images taken or created without someone's knowledge or consent.  One explanation of sexual deepfakes is that they are made through the use of advanced technology and make it appear as though individuals are in videos or images in which they never took part, as a person in an existing image or video which features sexual content is replaced with someone else's likeness without their consent.  The manipulated visual or audio content has a high potential to deceive.  It is important that we are clear the subject of the image must give consent.  This is about consent.  I really feel it is something that would strengthen the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Since the spark of the #MeToo movement we have rightly become more aware of things we may have passed off or written off as acceptable.  Thankfully, we have reached a stage where we know what is wrong and we know we will not stand for it any more.  The Bill is hugely important when it comes to sharing intimate images of someone.  If people do not have consent they cannot post the image.  The act of posting it is a criminal offence.  This is why we state it is so important.  We must discuss the definition of consent in the Bill because there is a massive difference between images shared between a loving couple and images stolen from a sleeping individual at a party, an intoxicated person or a child who does not know what they are sending out into the ether.  It is important we protect children and vulnerable adults as much as any adult of whom an image is taken or created.<\/p>  <p>  Just yesterday, a nine year old told me that his idea of sharing things on the Internet is like pouring water into the river.  We never get some of it back.  We might get some of it back but not all of it.  This is the thing about online images.  We might be able to control the lighting and mood but we cannot control what happens once the images leave us and end up online.  This is very important and must inform the legislation.  We have to make sure.  Many amendments have been tabled but, as other speakers have said, it is important to strengthen the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Images shared between two consenting adults and images later shared online that have been distorted for nefarious intent are vastly different.  This is why defining consent in the Bill is important.  We must include it or we risk the language being too loose, leaving consent to be defined by someone in a court of law in a \"she said, he said, she said\" type of conversation.  If we place it on a statutory footing it will be defined for all to see and for all to know and form the basis of education in this regard.  We have long known the Internet is a wild west without any kind of policing.  It is high time we introduced criminal sanctions for bad behaviour online.  It should always have been a criminal offence to share intimate images of someone without consent but now it must be the case.  The devastation from this type of abuse is absolutely horrific.  We have got to be very clear about any definition of consent and intent and note that image-based abuse is abuse of a sexual nature.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment Deputy Howlin.  He has been working on the Bill for a long time.  This is important and it needs to be done as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700044#SS00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1608219000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin for sponsoring the Bill and pursuing it.  It is extremely important and I commend his work on it.  I also thank Members throughout the House for their contributions on the Bill as it has worked its way through the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 1 to 7 all relate to the definition of an intimate image for the purposes of the offences in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  There was some discussion of this issue on Committee Stage and I appreciate that Deputies are concerned about the implications of the definition proposed in the Bill.  Broadly speaking, two concerns are apparent from the proposed amendments.  The first relates to the types of images that would come within the ambit of the definition.  The intention behind the amendments is to ensure that images that have been altered or doctored, commonly referred to as deep fakes, fall within its scope.  I assure the Deputies that very careful consideration was given to this definition during the drafting.  The definition refers to any visual representation by any means.  The word \"representation\" with regard to a person also extends to representation of their intimate body parts, of them being nude or of them being engaged in sexual activity.  The definition has been drafted in this manner to ensure the entire spectrum of images is covered, which would include a hand drawn image or a digital image either created or altered using modern forms of technology.  However, in light of the very obvious concerns raised by Deputies, I am minded to accept amendment No. 5 to include the words \"what is, or purports to be\" in the definition to ensure there is no confusion.  I hope this will allay the concerns raised on this point.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue relates to consent.  The amendments proposed by the Deputies have attempted to include reference to informed consent where a detailed definition of consent modelled on what is used for sexual offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  I respectfully have to disagree that these amendments are either necessary or appropriate.  The word \"consent\" is a readily understood concept in most of the criminal offences on this Statute Book and appears without definition for this reason.  There is a very specific definition of consent for the purposes of certain sexual offences due to the nature of those offences and the fact it is quite often the most contentious issue in a prosecution of that nature.  The definition as proposed in amendment No. 7 does not appear to make sense in the context of the offences in the Bill, particularly as it refers to the capture of an image rather than the recording of an image as appears in the offence.  For this reason it may be unworkable.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 would complicate matters further by referring to a reasonable expectation of privacy if an image was taken with the consent of the person.  The definition is simpler without this.  It would be an offence to distribute or publish without consent and it does not matter whether the person consented to the taking of the image.  Further, if the image was taken without consent this would fall within the remit of the offence in section 3.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 4 refers to informed consent, which is not further defined and, as such, adds little to the Bill.  The Bill does not contain a definition of consent because including such a definition could lead to a complication of what should be a relatively straightforward issue.  I am of the view that the amendments are unnecessary and could cause complications in any prosecution under the Bill.  For these reasons I cannot accept them.  However, I will accept amendment No. 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700044#SS00300","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1608219000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I welcome the acceptance of amendment No. 5.

The acceptance of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's amendment captures the concern of everybody who has spoken about what purports to be an image of somebody, in other words, an altered image or a superimposed image.

It is essential that we have objective sex education in our schools.  I understand that a new curriculum will be brought forward.  In many respects that new curriculum may be relatively progressive, certainly compared with what is taught in the schools today, but if the Government does not - and it seems it will not - take on board the point in our Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018, which came from the report of the former Joint Committee on Education and Skills on sex education, and remove the barrier of religious ethos from the Education Act, all of that can come to nothing because schools can decide not to deliver this curriculum, no matter how good it is, because it conflicts with their religious ethos.

To abuse and harass someone online is one of the most odious acts anyone can commit.  It says a great deal about the negative attributes of someone's characteristics.  I have seen it happen many times at home.  I have seen it happen on WhatsApp, Viber and Facebook.  It happens in the realms of social media, often hidden behind a cloud of anonymity.  Others do not hide behind the cloud of anonymity and are quite out there, so to speak, in what they do.  I have received my share of online harassment.  As a public representative representing communities and also as a teacher who has taught many children over the years, I know of many people who have been subjected to online harassment.  Fortunately for many of us who are at the receiving end, there is a little \"mute\" or \"ignore\" button we can press.  This means that when we see the banana skins thrown in front of us, we can step over them.  There are many people who engage in harassment.  There are others who may not be able to escape that net so easily.  I pity those who are closer to those who perpetrate this kind of harassment.<\/p>  <p>  This is a timely Bill.  It reflects where modern society has gone.  There was a time, probably in my father's time but it existed when I was growing up, when a bully was someone who stood up in the school yard and issues got sorted out by going to the teacher.  Sometimes, small boys and girls had to settle disputes in their own way in the yard.  Online trolling, harassment and abuse, however, has reached a more murky level.  People hide behind a cloud of anonymity and think they can treat people in whatever way they choose.  When I was teaching up to February of this year, we had a very simple mantra for the children in my class, which was that they should screenshot something, show it to someone and, ultimately, report it.  For children, that could be reporting to a teacher or another grown up but for adults it is important that there is also a legislative mechanism whereby they can report online abuse and harassment.  If we were walking down the street we would not accept a stranger haranguing, harassing and abusing us so why should we have to take it on WhatsApp, online, etc.?<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Bill is before the House this evening.  I hope that, without further ado, it will get support across the House.  In the months and years ahead, the people who are guilty of trolling people online and trying to disrupt people's normal way of life should not have a right to anonymity.  Their names should be made public.  We should know their identity.<\/p>  <p>  I know of several people who perpetrate this abuse.  Some of them might see this on my social media feed later when I put it up.  With or without legislation, they need to cease and desist because their actions in a community and among people who are trying to live normal lives can be very damaging.  I hope it gets the full support of the House.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude by wishing a very happy Christmas to the Ceann Comhairle and all the staff in Leinster House who have made the past number of very challenging months as good as they could possibly have been, in particular those staff who come here to the convention centre.  Somehow, after a century of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, they have managed to move all operations from Kildare Street with huge success.  I wish each and every one of them a very happy Christmas.

It is about three years since our society was shocked by the events that led to the death of Dara Quigley.  That has to be deeply regretted and we should never see a repeat of it.  More recently, there were scandalous events related to a Discord server and what emerged from that.  This Bill is being passed and we welcome it.  There are a couple of things in the amendments that we are dealing with which I would like to speak to, and I will press any amendments that we have, particularly regarding images being held or stored.  It is important that that is included in the Bill, because relationships can come or go, but it is not acceptable for somebody to hold on to images of a private or personal nature with the intent to do something with it.<\/p>  <p>  When one looks at what is going on in Irish society and indeed in other societies, since it is not particular to this country, there is a worrying misogynistic and abusive culture.  A recent study from Trinity College and Maynooth University showed how prevalent it is.  It shows that approximately 15% of Irish adults have been raped at some point in their life.  One in three has experienced some sort of sexual violence.  One in five women and one in ten men has been raped.  Some 31% of Irish adults experience sexual harassment, unwanted sexual comment or behaviour.  It is a deeply embedded part of our society.  Although we welcome the legislation, for us to frame the problem solely as a need to criminalise it after which it will go away would be a mistake.  If we look at the USA, the amount of legislation on this has not made society there any less misogynistic, dangerous or abusive.  If we do not present the problem as simply a need to criminalise this, then we have to look at other social solutions.  Tackling these wider societal issues is more of a challenge in the long run, because one cannot just pass legislation to do it.<\/p>  <p>  There needs to be an emphasis on education.  As has been said, there is an apparent need for a non-ethos-based sexual education programme, which can deal with issues regarding sexuality and consent.  Those of us who worked on the Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, dealing with the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly, will remember well that we recommended that sexual health and relationships education, including on contraception and consent, be provided in schools, colleges, youth clubs and other organisations involved in education, in an impartial and factual manner independent of school ethos.  I recently asked about the plans to implement that recommendation and I am not comforted by the answer.  It stated that there is a review of relationships and sexuality education, which is the model we have been using, and it repeated that schools have a responsibility to provide this, having regard to the ethos of the school.  I am not encouraged by that answer.  I think we have to look outside the criminalisation of these issues and at why it is happening in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  Society as a whole needs to recognise how sexual abuse can impact on us.  More investment will be needed, not just in education but in organisations that would support people who suffer from this kind of abuse.  In 2018, the organisation One in Four had to close its doors to waiting lists for adult survivors of abuse, because it did not have the capacity to deal with the demand on them.  The more we begin to uproot this from all aspects of our society, the more we will have a demand for this.  It is imperative that the State, the Government and all Departments connected with health, justice and education release those resources and begin to deal with it in wider society as well as passing legislation.  No matter what we do here today, it will not end tomorrow.  There is a deep-rooted problem here and we begin with our young people and re-educating adults who have a problem with misogyny.<\/p>  <p>  On amendment No. 12 in the names of Deputies Pringle, Joan Collins and Connolly, anybody convicted under this would be on the sexual offenders list.  I would have a problem with that.  If a 17 year old is convicted under this for abusive images, that person would carry that for the rest of his or her life, regardless of how many changes he or she makes, how he or she moves forward or how regretful he or she is of it.  It has significant consequences on where one can live or work.  I have a problem with that amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The use of the word \"reckless\" in amendment No. 11 is open to being too broadly interpreted.  I also refer to minors.  Are minors acting recklessly or is it part of a culture that needs to be uprooted?

A practical example would be if someone was involved in blackmail.  As I read it, the legislation as currently framed states that one has transgressed the law if one distributes the image, whereas we are saying that if one threatens to distribute the image, for example, in the case of blackmail, then that puts a person on the wrong side of the law.

We often come across cases, as have been told to me, where a person receives something without looking it, and then that person is holding it without requesting it or having any part in it.  We need to be cautious about that.  Many people receive material which they never asked for.  I have certainly come across situations where women have relayed to me that they have received intimate images of people that they never asked for and never wanted, yet the images arrive in their inbox, sometimes multiple times.  While they never wanted those images, it would be unfortunate if this legislation put them on the wrong side of the law.<\/p> <p>I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that we need to be careful that we do not criminalise young people for the rest of the lives for something that happened when they were teenagers, often very young teenagers.  We need to be careful in that regard because much of this activity happens between teenagers.  While we may frown upon it, it happens.  That is the reality.  We must try to build a society where this culture diminishes, moves to one side or is eliminated.  While this is very much about the legal matter, part of this is, of course, about education and developing a much more mature sense of what consent is all about and how people can work to ensure that happens in all aspects of their lives at all ages.<\/p> <p> While some of these amendments may be appropriate, we need to be careful around some of them.

Technology has changed as well and so we need to look very carefully at every aspect of it.  All of the debate thus far on the Bill has focused on the sharing of intimate images.  That element is only one part of the Bill but a very important part, and one that has come into greater focus in recent times because of the terrible harm that is being done by the sharing of intimate images.  The other element of the Bill is online bullying and harassment, which, as we have heard, has literally driven young people like Nicole Fox to suicide.  It is a really important part of the Bill as well.<\/p><p>I have described the right of people to use social media and the Internet.  It is a public space and people should be as protected there as they are in any public space, be that on a street or in a public park.  There are no such protections and the most terrible harm is being done to people.  For this reason, I have been very anxious to start the process of regulating that environment.  This legislation is a significant start, but I am under no illusion that it is only a start.  As technology evolves and the outworking of this Bill impacts, we will be back with amendments to it in the future.<\/p><p>The legislation will give reassurance to people who are suffering terribly.  Since I first published this legislation and held a press conference on it three years ago, I have been contacted by an unknown number of individuals about their personal experiences.  Much of this activity is not visible.  As I said, it is not like an assault in a street.  It is not visible but the harm can be horrendous.<\/p><p>On this group of amendments, I share Deputy Martin Kenny's view on the notion of holding images.  It is something we thought about and was referred to on Committee Stage.  The point about blackmail is covered.  Blackmail is a criminal offence, separate from anything we do here.  Threatening to distribute will be a criminal offence under this legislation.  A person can hold images and not distribute them.  Under section 2, threatening to distribute an intimate image of another person without his or her consent would be a criminal offence.<\/p><p>I have a reasonably open mind on whether offenders under section 3, which deals with the distribution of intimate images of a person which can cause terrible harm, should be added to the sex offenders register.  <i>Simpliciter<\/i>it looks like a sexual offence.  There would be instances where that would be warranted.  In terms of it encompassing young people, there is a section in the Bill whereby the prosecution of children, which under the Children Act is anybody under the age of 18, could only happen with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  That is right and proper.  It would be only in serious cases that minors would be prosecuted.  Whether there are cases where it might be justified to have such offenders included on the sex offenders register is a matter on which I have no absolute fixed view.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's view on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700047#VV00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1608220800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>This group of amendments relates to section 3, which deals with the distribution and publication of intimate images without consent.  Amendment No. 8 attempts to include the concept of selling, transmitting, making available or advertising an intimate image without consent.  These behaviours are already covered by the concepts of distributing or publishing, with the exception, perhaps, of the notion of making an intimate image available.  I am not sure what is intended by it, but it appears to be vague and, as such, is not appropriate for inclusion in a criminal offence.  I cannot accept the amendment for that reason.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 9 is technically flawed as it refers not to an intimate image but to content, which is not defined.  Furthermore, it does not appear to delete the original wording in section 3(1) and as such would make no sense if accepted.<\/p>  <p>  On amendments Nos. 10 and 11, the Minister outlined on Committee that she does not support the criminalisation of receiving or retention of intimate images in that we have provided for offences, with harsh penalties, where such images are distributed or published or where somebody threatens to do so.  It is unclear what \"holding\" means in this context and it is not defined.  I am concerned about the language used in amendment No. 11, in particular the use of the words \"through coercion\".  As rightly pointed out by Deputy Howlin, section 3 covers the threat to distribute where anybody is holding an image and that person is prepared to use it in any unlawful manner.  It is not clear whether it is intended that the person who commits the offence is coercing another to distribute or publish the intimate image or if he or she is doing so by reason of having been coerced by another to do so.  I think the intention behind the amendment is to criminalise a person for coercing another, not for being coerced.  However, this is not clear and could lead to unintended consequences in regard to the behaviour sought to be criminalised.  I appreciate the intention but I cannot accept these amendments.<\/p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, the Minister outlined her position in regard to the offences being treated as offences for the purpose of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  The offence is intended to deal with harm caused to a victim and, as the case may be, an intention to cause harm on the part of a defendant.  This is distinguishable from other offences on the Statute Book to which the provisions of the 2001 Act apply which are aimed at dealing with the sexual motivations of an offender and of potential future risk to the public.  Therefore, I cannot accept amendment No. 12.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the concerns raised in regard to this group of amendments and other amendments, under section 13 there is a commitment to carry out a review within three years of the operation of the Act.  As such, the legislation will be actively under consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700047#VV00400","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1608220800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1608220800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1608220800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 4, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:  \t&quot;(c) intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or through coercion requests, receives or procures any intimate image of a person from a third party without the consent of the person depicted in the image and with the knowledge that the intimate image is being distributed or published without consent of the person,&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700047#VV00700","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1608220800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1608221400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 12 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1608221400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14, in the names of Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith, Boyd Barrett, Barry, Gino Kenny and Paul Murphy, arise out of committee proceedings and are related.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700048#WW00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1608221400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>We will withdraw these amendments on the basis of the previous argumentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700048#WW00300","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1608221400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1608221400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 4, to delete lines 35 to 38, and in page 5, to delete lines 1 to 7 and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&quot;4. <\/b>(1) A person is guilty of an offence where he or she, by any means&mdash;  \t(a) distributes or publishes any threatening or grossly offensive communication about another person, or<br \/><br \/>(b) sends any threatening or grossly offensive communication to another person, with intent to cause serious interference with the other person&rsquo;s peace and privacy or to cause alarm or distress to the other person.<br \/><br \/>(2) For the purposes of <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, a person is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his or her acts, but this presumption may be rebutted.&quot;. <\/blockquote>  <p>This amendment deals with an issue we discussed on Committee Stage, namely, the question of intent.

However, there remains a problem with the section even after this amendment.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's response in this regard.  It is to do with what constitutes \"grossly offensive\" communications.  The main thrust of the Bill, and the main commentary around it, has rightly focused on image-based sexual abuse.  However, nowhere is \"grossly offensive\" defined in such a way as to limit it to communications of a sexual nature.  It is clearly much broader than that.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, this section, as it stands, could have real and damaging implications for freedom of speech because it provides that anyone who sends a \"grossly offensive communication\" to or about another person with the intent to \"cause harm\" is guilty of an offence carrying a potential sentence of up to two years in prison.  I have two issues with that.  First is the fact, as I said, that a \"grossly offensive communication\" is not defined anywhere in the Bill and is, therefore, left to the interpretation of a judge.  Second, \"harm\" is defined in the Bill to include where a communication \"causes alarm\".  A judge could decide that someone online calling me or any public representative whatever name under the sun has been grossly offensive and alarming and the person could be sent to prison for it.  I receive my fair share of abuse on social media.  I do not welcome it but I do not think it should be criminalised.  I do not think anyone should go to prison just because he or she caused me alarm.<\/p>  <p>  There is a fundamental issue of freedom of speech here, which is already lacking due to our draconian libel laws.  I fear that, as drafted, this section of the Bill hands a weapon to the powerful to constrain the freedom of speech of people criticising them.  It is the already powerful, not ordinary people or victims of serious abuse, who will have the knowledge and resources to make use of this section.  I welcome amendment No. 15 because it improves the section, but in a relatively limited way.

Generally speaking, it is the position in criminal matters that intention can be proved by reference to the natural and probable consequences of a person's actions.

I cannot agree to that change in the structure of the offence, which has been carefully considered.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  The matter can be kept under review and if it needs to be amended in future legislation, that certainly can be done.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has said she will keep an open mind on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy Paul Murphy's comments on freedom of speech, I was not in attendance on Committee Stage but my understanding is that this issue was strongly debated.  I assure the Deputy that it was also heavily considered during the drafting stage.  That is why there is a requirement in the Bill in regard to the intention to cause harm.  There is a view that there is sufficient protection there in respect of free speech.  I understand there was even a push to have the word \"grossly\" removed but that would have opened it up widely to all sorts of potential criminal offences.

The Minister of State is relying on that to say there is a very high bar.  In fact, all the person has to have done, because of how \"harm\" is defined, is to \"cause alarm\".  All he or she has to do is intend to cause me alarm by calling me whatever.<\/p> <p>That is a significant freedom of speech problem.  The reality of how it will or could be used, and I am just ringing an alarm bell here for the future, is precisely to criminalise those who are criticising those in power.  They should not be using the language they are using or whatever but they certainly should not be criminalised for it.  It is very concerning and I hope a constitutional protection for freedom of speech would mean that the judges would not seek to interpret it in such a broad way.

I do not think we are doing anybody a service by doing that.  Could the Government perhaps commit to coming back in January with this Bill and putting it through then?  I am worried about that.  I know it is the Minister of State's, probably the Department's and everybody's intention to have a review but in the real world the review will probably not happen which is the sad part about this.  That is no reflection on anybody as the Department has a great deal of work on its plate and so forth, and it is certainly seems that after tomorrow, this Bill goes into the distance as far as the Department is concerned.  I am a bit worried about that.  This is what we are faced with and it is probably a bit of a moot point talking about any of the amendments tonight, although they do need to be put forward and spoken about, in any event.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 inserts a new section on harassment in the Bill and it comes from the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI.  It has submitted that in the context of intimate partner violence.  The use of monitoring devices, including spyware, is a very common, insidious, often hard to detect and extremely serious form of harassment and abuse.  This kind of behaviour should be named and punished as such in our criminal law.  The RCNI&rsquo;s understanding of the D&aacute;il select committee proceedings was that there were fears that the presence of electronic spyware and physical monitoring devices, and the activities evidenced by their presence, may be very difficult to prove and therefore present an additional hurdle to victims.  They may be the case on occasion while on other occasions, their existence and activities are easy to prove because unambiguous physical or digital evidence points directly to them.  There is no reason there should not be a specific offence ready and waiting to mark the gravity of any spying behaviours which can be proved.  That is of vital importance.  Accordingly, RCNI recommends that this is retained in this Bill as a stand-alone offence, with a maximum penalty at least as great as that for deliberate or reckless distribution of intimate images without consent.<\/p><p>In some circumstances, it may not be detectable or enforceable but in other circumstances, it will be.  I do not think that is enough grounds not to do something, just because some people will get away with it.  That is the nature of crime.  Some criminals get away with it and some do not but we still have laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700049#XX02200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1608222000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I too support this amendment.

As I said in my opening comments on this, the framework should not be the final word, by any stretch of the imagination.  We will be building on it, firstly as we learn how it is operated.  New technologies will have to be addressed in the future.

It is the only one that would cause a particular difficulty.  I hope the legislation will proceed to the Seanad tomorrow.  Senators will have an opportunity to submit amendments tonight if they believe they are necessary.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the definition of intent in criminal law, a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his or her actions.  Therefore, I am not concerned that not including Deputy Howlin's amendment would in any way have an impact on the prosecution of somebody for intent.  It is not possible to know somebody's mind.  One can never conclusively establish what somebody intended but it is presumed that he or she intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her actions.  That is well established within our criminal law.  I have practised criminal law for about 12 years so I am very much aware of it.  Deputy Howlin may have been trying to add a belt and braces and to offer clarification.  That is why I would have had no difficulty accepting the amendment.  It simply restates the existing law.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 16, which proposes a new section 5, seeks to include a new offence of harassment in the Bill.  I draw the Deputy's attention to section 11 of the Bill, which amends the current offence of harassment contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  On Committee Stage, the Minister agreed with the extension of the offence of harassment to include persistent communications with a person rather than simply communications with another person.  This is considered completely appropriate in the social media age, and the proposed amendment to the existing harassment offence will retain this idea.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed harassment offence in amendment No. 16 does not include other powers for a court that are currently provided for in subsections (3) to (5) of section 10 of the 1997 Act, providing that a court may impose an order on a defendant compelling him or her not to communicate with or approach the victim.  This can be imposed regardless of whether a person has been convicted of the offence of harassment.  It is an offence not to comply with such an order.  It is considered that these provisions are extremely valuable.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of this Bill inserts a new subsection (c) into section 10 to include communications about another person as an element of that offence by simply amending the existing harassment offence, as was agreed on Committee Stage, and the additional orders mentioned in subsections (3) to (5) remain as options for a sentencing judge.  This is extremely important as orders can be proposed with or without a conviction.  Furthermore, the aggregating factor in regard to the fact that the victim and the defendant are, or were, in an intimate relationship is required, with section 40 of the Domestic Violence Act also having effect.  Therefore, I will be opposing amendment No. 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700050#YY00500","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1608222600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1608222600,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 arise out of committee proceedings.

In the original Bill I drafted, to amend the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, I had the harassment elements included in a judge's capacity to preserve the victim's anonymity.  I refer to the amendment of section 10 of the 1997 Act.  The Minister was of the view that the online harassment elements should not be encompassed in the capacity to keep the victim anonymous so the revised section 5 of the Bill before us preserves anonymity for victims of offences under sections 2 and 3, but not the anonymity of victims under section 10 of the 1997 Act.  My two amendments are to reinstate the provision so that a judge, in proceedings, would have the capacity to give a direction that the identity of a victim of harassment should not be made known.  I say this mainly because of the experience I have had, since the Bill was originally published, of people who have suffered online harassment.  It can be absolutely crushing, literally to the point of suicide.  I can say with some certainty that there is a fear that people will not come forward if they feel the harassment they are suffering would be compounded by having their names in the media or otherwise known.  I ask the Minister of State to consider allowing the harassment element to be encompassed within the capacity of the court to make a determination that the anonymity of the victim should be preserved in such cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700050#YY00800","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1608222600,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 propose to extend the anonymity provisions in section 5 of the Bill to the offence of harassment under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  Anonymity and privacy provisions in legislation are an exception to the normal rules in regard to the administration of justice in public guaranteed by the Constitution.  Any departure from this must be justifiable.  I appreciate that the nature of image-based offences would certainly warrant the protection of privacy considering the intimate nature of the images.  I am aware that, in the past, cases involving intimate images have been prosecuted under harassment laws.  This is a very sensitive matter.  However, as this Bill proposes to introduce distinct offences to deal with the intimate images, it is unlikely that this would be the case in the future.  Harassment is a very wide-ranging offence that can be relatively minor or extremely serious, and the protection of privacy may not be justifiable in all cases.  This requires careful consideration.  I therefore ask Deputy Howlin not to press the amendments.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has undertaken to consider this matter further in the context of another Bill, which is currently being prepared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700050#YY00900","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1608222600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>On Committee Stage and subsequently, the Minister indicated that there is a justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill coming next year and that she will give further consideration to the instances concerned in light of it.

It is about people's agency and regaining control over anything that has been taken from them by the non-consensual sharing of images.  If a person waives their anonymity, then they can also name the perpetrator.

I know the Minister of State is saying that a Bill is being drafted at the moment but the question is whether it will it come forward in January or February, or later in the year.

The Observatory on Violence against Women and the Victims&rsquo; Alliance were calling for a change to the two-year summary proceedings sunset clause.  The Bill originally said that the Act may be instituted at any time &quot;within 2 years from the date on which the offence was committed&quot; and both the observatory and the Victims&rsquo; Alliance want this changed so that the two years would start when the person became aware of the offence, or should reasonably have become aware of the offence.  I do not think that there should be any time limit because of the nature of these offences.  Such offending material could be around for a long time before the person concerned becomes aware of it.  Two years seems a ridiculously short and unacceptable amount of time.  What if the person finds out years later that their images have been shared on sites or within groups?  I am sure there could be many instances of images being shared without consent or knowledge and that the people in the photos may never know that their privacy has been breached in this way.  <\/p><p>It seems unfair to put a time limit on when this Act may be instituted, especially given the hidden corners of the Internet, the boys' club sentiments in some circles and the misogyny displayed the world over.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that the limit here is usually six months and that she has increased it to two years, but I think it should be increased further.<\/p><p>Rape Crisis Network Ireland has stated that it welcomes this proposed amendment and has urged that it be accepted.  It has stated that in its respectful submission, the proposed removal of the existing two-year time limit would help to bring even more offences under this Bill within the reach of prosecution and, therefore, of accountability for perpetrators.  Accordingly, it has welcomed the proposed amendment and has urged that it be accepted.  The key thing is to open offenders to prosecution because that will have a cooling and chilling effect.  What we want to achieve is for none of these images to be distributed in the first place.  The only way we can do that is by having legislation with a strong enough chilling effect.<\/p><p>The nature of the Internet means that it is possible for images to be around for a long time before somebody becomes aware of them.  We are not going to be trawling the Internet and looking for offending images.  When someone becomes aware of an offence, it might be a long time since the image was circulated.  That is why this amendment is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700051#ZZ01300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1608223200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.  We are trying to deal with a serious issue.  As Deputy Pringle has alluded to, the relevant images might be years old and, for some reason, they may appear ten years later.  One might not know for a number of years that such an image is circulating and one might find out by accident, or whatever way it happens.  I am confused as to why we need a sunset clause.  The two-year limit seems a small window.  The images may be hidden or stored away somewhere and then dusted down and used as intimidation or threats and eventually released.  It could take a long time and a lot of damage could be done in the meantime when a victim does not know the images are there or what is in them.  It is important that there is not an expiry date for a person to make a complaint or for a prosecution to take place.

Is the offence committed on the date that the picture or the subject of the complaint is published or made available, or is an offence committed each time an image is made available?  Could that be constructed as a separate offence?  I ask the House to consider a situation in which somebody puts a picture up on a particular website or sends it to the far side of the world.  That image may be available in the Far East for a period of time and nobody, including the person whose image it was, would know it was there for a considerable length of time.  If that person then discovered it, would the two-year limit apply from the time of the discovery that the image was out there, or from when it was first published or sent?<\/p> <p>The issue of the time limit really needs to be dealt with.

I just checked with some Senators and they received a message from the Bills Office today saying that once the Bill is passed, a new version will be sent to them tonight, depending on the amendments that have been accepted on Report Stage.  I do not think we can justify not accepting amendments on the grounds of time restrictions because Senators will receive a written report on the outcome of amendments made following Report Stage.  We can still have a proper to and fro debate and if amendments are deemed worthy of acceptance, as I believe Deputy Howlin's was, we should accept them tonight.  On that, I apologise to Deputy Howlin for omitting his contribution to the Bill in my previous statement.  I know he worked hard on it over the past couple of years.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment is a sensible one in accordance with technology and groups such as WhatsApp groups, where these images may be stored.  It might be several years before a person becomes aware their image is being violated, cheered and disseminated through different groups.  The law has to be in accordance with how technology is evolving so it is important we accept that it might be some time before a person becomes aware that their image has been misused to this extent and that we factor that into the laws as we make them.

I reiterate her views.  Section 10(1) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 provides that summary prosecutions must be initiated within a time limit of six months.  The time limits provided for in law for summary offences reflect the fact that an individual should not have a relatively minor offence that is summary in nature hanging over him or her for a disproportionate length of time.<\/p>  <p>  Section 6 extends the time limit for the bringing of a summary prosecution to two years.  This is something I support as I appreciate there may be difficulties in investigating offences that may be entirely online, as recognised by the Law Reform Commission.  However, I am also mindful that this extension is an exception to the normal rules in relation to criminal prosecutions and should be treated as such.  I point out that this particular section will only apply to summary offences under the Bill and not indictable offences, which attract a higher penalty.  There is no time limit for the prosecution of indictable offences in Ireland.  While I appreciate the intention behind the Deputies' proposals in amendments Nos. 21 to 23, inclusive, I do not believe it is appropriate to extend time for the bringing of summary proceedings beyond a significant extension provided for in the Bill already.  This could have the effect of extending the time for summary prosecutions to any point in the future, which would mean it could be treated the same as an indictable offence.  This is not desirable in practice and could be considered to interfere with the right to a fair trial, as guaranteed under the Constitution.  I, therefore, ask the Deputies not to press the proposed amendments in this session.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Kenny's comments, my understanding is that any republication would be a new offence and treated accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700052#AAA00300","speaker":"1618"},{"type":"speech","time":1608223800,"counter":496,"content":"<p>This was discussed on Committee Stage and the Minister was opposed to it.  There is a difference which has to be taken on board in the Department.

One image can have a huge negative impact and that is the problem.  The 1851 Act is probably not appropriate at this stage in relation to this because we are dealing with the Internet, digital images and stuff like that.  Images can be around for a long time.  It might be only one image and investigators will look at it and say it is only one image so it is not as serious and should be a summary offence rather than indictable offence.  Then they will say it is only one image and the timeframe has passed, so it does not matter anyway.  However, the impact on the victim will still be as great and that is the main factor that should drive us.

Let us hope they are right.  There have been more than 70 million confirmed cases worldwide and many more people who have never been diagnosed.  It has caused 1.6 million recorded deaths and many hundreds of thousands more deaths have gone unrecorded.  Millions of survivors are living with the exhaustion and adverse health effects of what is called \"long Covid\".  Individuals, families and entire communities have suffered greatly.  Many in Ireland have lost loved ones to the disease - family, friends and work colleagues.  The measures we have had to introduce have resulted in people losing their livelihoods and many facing isolation.  The global economic slump is the largest since the Second World War.<\/p>  <p>  Out of the ashes of all of this suffering and, at times, despair, we now have hope.  The unprecedented work of the global medical and scientific community has brought us to a point where the first Covid vaccine is likely to be authorised for Ireland in a matter of days.  What a wonderful thing to say in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Data from clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines suggest they reduce the effects of Covid in approximately 95% of people vaccinated.  Over time, this should help the country return to life as we knew it before Covid.  We may still be in the tunnel, but for the first time we can see light.<\/p>  <p>  Following a Government decision, we announced the launch of the national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan on Tuesday following a Government decision.  This was another significant step forward in our fight against Covid-19.  In November, the Government established a high-level task force led by Professor Brian MacCraith.  The task force was charged with developing an overall strategy and implementation plan for the delivery of a Covid-19 vaccination programme.  I am most grateful to Professor MacCraith, the members of the task force and everyone who has contributed to its work.  They have been able to produce this strategy within a tight timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the strategy builds on many months of hard work by many different people and organisations in the world of healthcare in Ireland.  These include the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the National Immunisation Office, the national immunisation advisory committee, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and many more.  It has been a show of Team Ireland and what can be done.<\/p>  <p>  Similar to all other EU member states, Ireland is awaiting news from the European Medicines Agency, EMA, which assesses the safety and efficacy of all drugs.  This week, we learned that the EMA would bring forward to next week a meeting to consider the Pfizer vaccine.  As colleagues will know, the original date set for this meeting was 29 December.  We heard in recent days that it was being brought forward to 21 December.  We have great hope that other candidate vaccines, including those produced by Moderna and AstraZeneca, will be in a position to receive authorisation early in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  Once initial supplies are received - they are likely to be limited in quantity at the start - the HSE will be in a position to begin vaccinating the highest risk groups.  The national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan describe Ireland's high-level plan for safe, effective and efficient vaccination of the population while maximising the continuation of service delivery in the rest of our healthcare system.  The plan will evolve as we plan, deliver and refine our approach in light of national and international experience with the vaccines.<\/p>  <p>  The report outlines the strategy in terms of logistics, deployment, workforce planning, communications and other essential aspects of the vaccination programme plan.  Vaccines will be rolled out in three phases.  The first will be the initial roll-out, which will be followed by a mass ramping up and, finally, the third phase, which will be open access.  Vaccines will be administered in long-term care facilities, large-scale healthcare sites, mass vaccination centres, GP clinics and community pharmacies.  They will be provided at no cost to members of the public.  All vaccinators will be qualified and registered healthcare professionals who will receive comprehensive and specialist training on Covid-19 vaccines.<\/p>  <p>  The initial vaccine roll-out will focus on the highest priority groups.  At its heart, our approach is to protect those who are most likely to contract Covid-19 and at greatest risk of serious adverse consequences if they contract it, including death.  Given that supplies will initially be limited, an important consideration is how to prioritise groups.  This matter has been addressed by the recent announcement of an allocation strategy, which was agreed by the Government last week.  This strategy identifies population cohorts at a relatively high risk.  A further subdivision of these cohorts may be needed to assist in focusing available vaccine supplies where they can bring the greatest benefit.  Decisions on matters such as the approach to vaccination of key workers in essential jobs will need to be considered at programme level.  As supply increases, it may well be possible to vaccinate different groups at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is taking part in a procurement exercise that is being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure suitable, safe and effective vaccines in sufficient quantities to combat the disease.  We have already opted into five advance purchase agreements, APAs, with pharmaceutical companies and a process is in place to opt into a sixth.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that, while this is a time of hope and we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, the vaccines are not a silver bullet.  We will still be observing public health measures well into 2021.  It is vital that we understand this and continue to show one another the wonderful solidarity that has been displayed throughout our country during the pandemic.  Right now, the situation across Europe is precarious.  In recent days, our own case numbers have increased.  I will speak more to that issue shortly.  Nonetheless, our 14-day incidence rate is now the lowest in the EU at 88 per 100,000 population.  To put that in perspective, the rate is 547 in the Netherlands, 341 in Germany and 1,208 in Croatia.<\/p> <p>Huge credit goes to those who have worked gruelling hours for many months, that is, the doctors, nurses and others on the front line as well as those who were redeployed earlier in the year; Mr. Paul Reid and his team of managers, who have worked under huge pressure; Dr Tony Holohan, Dr. Ronan Glynn and all the other members of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, as well as the many people in my Department who may not be household names but who have made an outstanding contribution at this most challenging time.<\/p> <p> I would like to finish today by saying there are still big challenges ahead, not least in the logistical matters detailed in the implementation plan.  It will not all be smooth sailing from the start of January or the end of this month.  I urge members of the public to remember that every contact counts.<\/p> <p> Before I came in here for the debate this evening, I had a long conversation post NPHET with the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and the deputy CMO.  They have been reviewing the latest information right up to today and the situation is precarious.  The R number for last week was calculated somewhere between 0.9 and 1.0.  As of today, the latest we have from Professor Nolan is an R number of between 1.1 and 1.3.  If we assume it is approximately 1.2, the modelling we saw from NPHET and from Professor Nolan's team shows that at anything above approximately 1.2, particularly given the level of cases we are at, the cases can rise very quickly.<\/p> <p> We know the positivity in testing is up.  The referrals for PCR testing and the incidences of doctors and GPs recording flu-like symptoms in their surgeries are also up.  The lead indicators we watch to see what is coming in the next few days and weeks are all pointing to a serious increase in cases.  We have seen the number of contacts per person who tests positive rise from 2.8 recently to 3.6 today.<\/p> <p> Ireland has done incredibly well.  In fact, we have done the best in the western world as a nation and a body politic in working together to drive the virus down and keep people alive.  The conversation I just had with the CMO was sobering.  He will be doing a press conference with Dr. Glynn this evening and will be relaying some of this.<\/p> <p> I will, however, re-emphasise that the debate this evening is one of hope.   It is a debate about the vaccinations.  Earlier in the year, I spoke to infectious disease experts, as, I am sure, did my colleagues, who said it could be years before we had a vaccine, or that we may never get a vaccine.  They said this based on what happened with previous similar diseases where vaccines were not developed and, in some cases, still have not been developed.<\/p> <p> It is, however, essential now as Ireland is in this privileged position of opening up for Christmas, we are able to meet our friends and family, we have a very low case rate, and we are looking at this wonderful hope at the end of the year, which is the imminent arrival of vaccines, and it is as important now as any other time that we keep minding each other, keep each other safe and keep following the public health advice which has served us well.<\/p> <p> I will finish by repeating some of the clearest advice I ever heard, which was from Dr. Ronan Glynn many months ago.  He said whatever number of people a person is planning on meeting in the next week, just think forward about who it is, whether it is family, friends, colleagues or whoever, and just plan to reduce and bring the number down, because if we bring the number of contacts down, we bring the R number down, and if we bring that down, we slow down the growth rate, keep people safe, keep people in nursing homes safe and protect our hospitals and healthcare system, which need to stay open for non-Covid work.  I will make a final appeal.  I know the House has been united in this right the way through.  We must keep communicating with the people we represent and say to them to keep minding each other, keep contacts down and let us keep each other safe through the Christmas period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700053#BBB00600","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608225000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with an Teachta O'Reilly.  First, in what will be my final contribution in this House before Christmas, I wish the Minister and his family a happy and peaceful Christmas and, indeed, all the staff in the Department and those in the HSE.  I thank sincerely all the front-line workers who work in our acute hospitals and in primary, mental health and community care, as well as those in our nursing homes who have done a really difficult and challenging job and Trojan work over recent months in what has been a very difficult situation.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Professor MacCraith on his work and, indeed, all the expert group.  I am on record as saying the plan they produced is not just credible, it is very good and is a very good framework.  Like all plans, however, it comes down to resourcing.  We must look under the bonnet to see how well this plan will be resourced and how quickly it can be delivered if and when any of the vaccines get approval from the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  We hope that will happen as soon as it is safe to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I say sincerely that it is important we do not unrealistically raise anybody's expectations about the vaccine.  I do not say that as any criticism of the Minister but as a general point.  We really need to be honest with people about how quickly the vaccine will come on stream.  It is possible that the European Medicines Agency will sign off and approve any number of the vaccines before the end of the year or early next year.  However, at the Joint Committee on Health this week, even with the advance purchase agreements we have with different pharmaceutical companies, totalling more than 14 million doses of different vaccines, we were told the most likely candidate for first approval would be the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  We are in for 2.2 million doses of that particular vaccine.  We were told, however, only 5,000 of those doses would come in the first phase, and then a couple of hundred thousand, but no more than that.  We were not even given a figure of what a couple of hundred thousand will mean.  Is it 200,000 or 500,000?  My point is we do not know how quickly the supply of the doses will come, and that will determine how quickly people will become vaccinated.  I say that in terms of not raising people&rsquo;s expectations because we must be careful and we cannot be complacent.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister quite rightly pointed out that the positivity rates in this State are increasing.  The 14-day and seven-day incident rates, the five-day average and the hospitalisations are increasing, and of course all that is a concern.  We can see what is happening in the North with high figures and huge pressures on our front line.  We need to bear that in mind as we approach the end of the year.  As we know, January, February and March in any given year are a difficult and challenging time, especially for people who work in our acute services.  We must do everything we possibly can to check ourselves and take personal responsibility to ensure we do what is right over the Christmas period.  Obviously, the HSE, the Department and the Government have a role and responsibility to give and reiterate that message time and again.  The virus has not gone away.  It is still here and it is still spreading.  We cannot be complacent.  We must remain vigilant.<\/p>  <p>  I want to start to go under the bonnet of the plan a little bit and raise not what I see as concerns but suggestions as to how we can give confidence to people that the vaccine will be rolled out as quickly as it can.  The document quite rightly says that the vaccinators will all be qualified medical professionals.  That is how it should be.  People need to have confidence in the administration of the vaccine and in the vaccine itself and I expect the vast majority of people will.  How many vaccinators will there be?  How quickly can we get all the training done?  The plan also says these vaccinators will have to be trained.<\/p> <p>Maybe some of them will not need training but some will.  Timelines and urgency are important in this.<\/p> <p> The plan also talks about mass vaccination centres.  The Minister will know that I published a plan on providing a framework for how the vaccine could and should be rolled out.  One of the things we called for was these mass vaccination centres.  We highlighted in our submission at the time that we felt that community settings, such as sporting facilities, for example, would be a good place for these vaccination centres, because we need to engender a community spirit and to encourage as many people as possible to get vaccinated.  We were told at the Joint Committee on Health that there will be 15 vaccination centres.  We do not know the geographical spread of those yet.  That needs to be there.  We also do not know the level of staff that will be required for these centres.  The more vaccination centres we have and the more staff we have trained and in place, the quicker the vaccines can be rolled out and the quicker people can become vaccinated.<\/p> <p> That is my point on not raising expectations because my understanding from what was being said by the experts is that we might not reach peak vaccination in this State by the summer of next year.  It could be closer to the end of next year.  We would all hope it will be sooner than that and it can be done as quickly as possible.  That will come down to the Minister giving reassurance on how many doses of the vaccine we will get and when we will get them.  When the Minister has that information, it should be clearly communicated to people.  Second, when we get the doses, the storage capacity should be right, the distribution and logistical requirements should be right and the role of GPs, pharmacies and so on should also be advanced and all of the work should be done.<\/p> <p> I met GPs and the head of the pharmacy union in recent days.  They have other issues aside from the vaccine.  The Minister met them recently as well about a new contract for pharmacists.  They need to be communicated with on the vaccine.  They need to know what their role will be and when they will play a role in all of this.  When we have mass vaccination centres, for example, is it envisaged that GPs and pharmacists will also be administering the vaccine in tandem with these centres?  Is that the plan?  These are the questions that will need to be teased out and answered.  One of the requirements I asked of the Minister, which he was supportive of anyway, was that the vaccine should be free.  If it is being administered by GPs and pharmacies, that has to be worked out quickly.  There cannot be any problems, delays or issues that arise that could and should have been foreseen so now is the time to make sure we get all of that right.<\/p> <p> I want to touch on the need for public education because I am supportive of vaccines.  I understand the importance of vaccines and how they have all but eliminated many diseases in the past.  The crucial role they have played, not just in the elimination of diseases but in their suppression in some cases, is extraordinary.  The development of vaccines and of new technologies and research in this area has been phenomenal.  That is something we should celebrate and something that makes them as safe as they can possibly be, which is why I will be at the front of the queue if and when the opportunity comes to be vaccinated.  My family and I will be vaccinated because I want to play my part in suppressing the virus.  There will be people who will have questions, however, and politicians should not be the ones who give medical advice.  The medical advice should be given by medical professionals and the medical professionals are people like Professor Karina Butler, who has done a first-class job in recent weeks in communicating a clear and coherent message and we need more of that.<\/p> <p> Public information will be important.  If people have questions, we should not knock them.  We should encourage them to go to a GP and to get information from credible, sound and reliable sources, as opposed to the unreliable sources we have seen with other vaccines in the past.  We should encourage that and make sure they go to their GPs and get factual information to equip them to be in a position to then take the vaccine.  That will be an important part of all of this.<\/p> <p> I have been heartened by the uptake in the flu vaccine this year.  Even though we had more doses this year than in previous years, there still was not enough because of the demand.  That tells me that people will want to be vaccinated.  We have a huge job of work to do.  The Minister has a heavy responsibility and I wish him, his Department and all of those who have done a lot of work in this area well in that.  It will be the biggest challenge that will face us next year and one we collectively have to rise to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700054#CCC00200","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608225600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about this important task force, to which, as my colleague pointed out, we offer our full support.  We know that vaccination programmes save lives.  There can be no equivocation on that and they must, in and of themselves, be supported.  When we speak this evening, the words of Dr. Mary Favier are in my mind.  More importantly, she said that vaccines themselves do not save lives but that getting vaccinated saves lives.  That is what is important.  Talking about it and planning for it are important but when we roll up our sleeves and get it is when we will see the real benefit.<\/p>  <p>  This crisis constitutes the greatest public health crisis we have encountered in 100 years.  Over 2,000 people have died in Ireland and over 1 million people have died globally in this crisis.  Some 76,000 people have contracted Covid-19 in this State, including people we work alongside.  Thankfully, many have made a recovery due to the hard work of our medical and health professionals and due to modern medicine.  However, we still do not know the long-term implications of Covid-19, with many of those who have recovered saying that they still experience post-viral symptoms.  This further underlines the need to ensure that people do not contract the virus.  There are countless people alive and healthy today due to the public health measures, the commitment of the public in adhering to them, and the great work of our medical and healthcare professionals.<\/p>  <p>  Worryingly, there have been two variant strains of Covid-19 identified in the past two months, one of which has just been identified in Britain in recent days.  It must be reiterated that not getting Covid-19 is the best protection against Covid-19 and its long-term implications until we can roll out the vaccine.  Therefore, I would implore people not to let their guards down as we begin the roll-out of the vaccine, to stay alert and safe, to mind themselves and to listen to the public health experts.<\/p>  <p>  Thanks to the brilliance and dedication of the scientific and medical community, which has spent every waking minute of the last year investigating and researching this virus, we have these vaccines in the pipeline.  We cannot fully quantify the levels of intelligence of these people or the amazing work they have done.  They are the foremost scientists in the world.  They have spent so much time investigating and researching this and they have come up with these vaccines.  They have been through all of the necessary trials and they are among the most researched treatments in human history.  Thankfully, they appear to be effective, which is the main thing.  Hearing that effective vaccines have been approved felt as good as when Dublin won five all-Irelands in a row.  I am sure they will do the business for us at the weekend and I will have similar feelings when they win six all-Irelands in a row.  A task force is needed and welcome.  I wish it every success in the work it will be doing.<\/p>  <p>  We need a comprehensive vaccination awareness and uptake campaign to pave the way to ensure a maximum uptake of this vaccine.  I would implore the Minister, the HSE and the Department to work to combat misinformation.  By way of example, I cite leaflets that were dropped in my constituency in Balbriggan.  They seem to target working-class areas.  That is very worrying.  The authors of the leaflets say there is no need for a vaccine because there is no virus.  I would like them to tell that to my cousins, who lost their Dad to this virus.  These leaflets are slick and a lot of money went into them.  They look exactly like the HSE leaflets and the advice we get in the door.  They also make reference to 5G, which helpfully marks them out for the misinformation they are.  I am deeply troubled that these leaflets will be dropped in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be on the ground with an information campaign to combat that.  We need to go to where people are.  There is no point in us all saying people should just get the vaccine and wagging our fingers at them.  We need to be able to speak to people in a way that they can hear and understand how important this is.  We need to be able to cut through this misinformation.  It straight up frightened me when I saw the state of these leaflets because they are so well produced and slick.<\/p> <p>It is one thing to have people going around the country with the lit-up billboard saying, \"No vaccines, \"No virus\", \"No masks\", etc.  They look a little bonkers and maybe people will have a laugh at that.  However, these leaflets look exactly like the HSE information leaflets.  It is so important that we combat the misinformation contained within those.  We are willing to work with the Minister to ensure that we can do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700055#DDD00200","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608226200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>As it is the last time I will speak in the Chamber before Christmas, I wish the Minister and all his staff who have worked incredibly hard and indeed all the workers across the healthcare systems the very best and thank them for all their efforts in this extraordinary year.  I particularly also thank the HSE, led by Mr. Paul Reid, who has done an incredible job and deserves great credit.<\/p>  <p>  We all go through our political careers in one way or another.  We all face various different obstacles - I am no different - but this is the biggest challenge the Minister will ever face.  The Minister is like the front-row forward, 'Ginger' McLoughlin, when he was playing for Ireland and the whole pack got on top of him, pushed him over the line and brought half the English pack with them.  That is the support the Minister will need to roll out this vaccine.  There will be no difference between me and the Minister on this issue.  I will support the Minister wholeheartedly.  I will make suggestions from time to time but I will support the Minister 100%.  It is the biggest challenge the Minister will ever face.  If we can get this right, and as comprehensive as possible, I believe there is nothing more the Minister could achieve in his political career.  I sincerely wish the Minister well.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the T&aacute;naiste earlier today for confirmation of what the President of the European Commission, Dr. von der Leyen, said in relation to the roll-out of vaccines and he confirmed that we will have vaccines here on 27, 28 and 29 December.  That is good news.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make a few points in support of the Minister, but also some suggestions.  We have signed up for six vaccines in advance.  I presume there may be others.  The Minister might let us know where negotiations are with them because they are always in advance.<\/p>  <p>  We have 15 locations for the roll-out.  I presume that is a working map.  There are some geographical coverage issues but I will not labour that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask the Minister a little about resources.  Have we looked at a plan of bringing people out of retirement, and doing other things, because this will be a mass issue?  I suspect and hope that by March-April next year we could have a lot of vaccine potential that we need to roll out on a mass scale.  I presume that is being planned for.<\/p>  <p>  One question relates to the key workers.  The Minister will have heard this previously.  At some point in the next few weeks, we need to distinguish between teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and child care workers and whether these will fit in to that key workers category or be down below.  Events, maybe even the past few hours in Killorglin in County Kerry, may influence our thinking if that is to happen more frequently.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the roll-out and the interaction with pharmacies and GPs, we need to learn lessons from the flu vaccine roll-out.  No doubt it was not perfect.  It was good but it was not perfect.  Issues there relating to how the distribution model worked were real, particularly in geographically isolated areas.  Obviously, we need to learn from that.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to know how the Minister got on with his meeting on Friday last with the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  For three or four weeks now, I have been raising whether there are any issues here that we need to deal with as a legislature.  Many people had issues with the public service card.  I did not have many but I do not want to run into hurdles.  The data we are collecting here is as sensitive, if not far more sensitive, because we will have to match vaccines to people with underlying illnesses as we build up data.  Some vaccines might suit me more than the Minister or anyone with an underlying illness or medical condition.  Where are we with that?<\/p>  <p>  The information technology, IT, system is something that I have been speaking about for months because we do not have one.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly and I sat for years on health committees talking about ehealth.  We now have to build it in a couple of weeks.  That is the reality.  This system has to be robust.  It will have to gather all that information I spoke about.  In addition, it will probably have to be rolled out on an ongoing basis because the likelihood is these vaccines will need to be given annually for a number of years until we see where we are going.  I would like an update on that.<\/p>  <p>  I have received confirmation that if anyone privately wants to try and get the vaccine, if we get to a stage next year where private institutions or private companies want to do it, that will not happen.  It will all be co-ordinated by the State.  We rigorously have to stick to that because money can never be the medium by which people are vaccinated.  Even if one of the producing companies is based in Ireland, it still has to be done by the State.<\/p>  <p>  I have two other issues, one of which I am passionate about.  I attended the world vaccination conference last year.  Dr. Glynn was at it with me.  The public awareness campaign needs to start before the vaccine roll-out.  We have such a campaign.  I am deeply worried about some of the misinformation and, dare I say it, some of the misinformation that is coming from Members in this House.  There are Members in this House giving out misinformation in relation to vaccines.  It is a disgrace and they should be ashamed of themselves.  We need to follow the science.  If people have concerns, they can go through their medical professionals.  The Minister should remember we all deal with the public.  We deal with vulnerable people, impressionable people and elderly people and if they do not get the vaccine they could be in serious trouble.  We all have a duty and a responsibility as public representatives to deal with that appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, I am quite conscious of rules.  We will have an interim period next year where some people have been vaccinated and others will not.  Will we create a passport or certificate?  The T&aacute;naiste said we would but he was not clear on it - it is not his fault.  If there are events or activities happening in the middle of next year, will there be a situation where private organisations of private events can look for a certificate to say one is vaccinated because that would raise moral, legal, ethical and, dare I say it, civil liberty issues and we would need to have a standard on that in advance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700056#EEE00200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1608226200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the national Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy announced on Tuesday by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to raise the point of vaccine allocation sequencing.  I welcome the approach of prioritising those who are over the age of 65 and are residents of long-term care facilities.  We have seen a rapid spread of Covid-19 over the course of the pandemic in certain areas relating to people who are part of that age group.  We must try and deal with that first, where possible, in terms of the vaccination roll-out.  We are all aware that it is a major challenge and unfortunately, in terms of fatalities, it has been a difficult experience for many older people in our communities who are very worried about Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I have been listening to some of my colleagues here in the House today on the issue of misinformation.  That is something, on a political level, that has become a major challenge in Irish politics over the past number of years, but particularly in 2020, which was a general election year.  We must be absolutely clear with the public that the vaccination is a clear way for our population to deal with this outbreak of Covid-19 and get on to a future without it, recognising that vaccinations were a major part in the eradication of multiple diseases and illnesses throughout the course of modern human history.  It is outrageous that Members of this House are willing to come in here and pander to the message of anti-vaxxers in this country which is disgusting.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 vaccine has seen more investment than any other vaccination in history throughout the planet to deal with this pandemic.  The virus has sadly ended the lives of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the European Continent and North America, and here, in Ireland as well, has sadly ended the lives of so many people with and without underlying health conditions.  The message from Government has to be absolutely crystal clear that we need to embrace the vaccination.  Also, I would like to say on the record of the House that when it is available to me, I will take that vaccination.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has put a great deal of work into his role.  Few Ministers for Health, as Deputy Stephen Donnelly will be aware, get thanks.  People can be easily critical of the job that the Minister is doing.<\/p> <p>The Government has done everything it can.  Those involved in the task force have been fantastic.  I am delighted to see some decent names on it with good experience of working in logistics from IDA Ireland, academia and our universities.  That is critically important in ensuring public confidence in the vaccination roll-out.<\/p> <p> It is important we continue to look at other areas alongside the vaccination strategy which will take some time before it is available to everybody.  It is important we continue research into antigens.  We cannot forget that Ireland is home to many of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies.  I stand to be corrected but from my recollection nine out of the top ten pharmaceutical companies in the world have their European headquarters in Ireland.  We are at the forefront of the war on Covid-19.  We should lead the world in research on this issue, as well as messaging with our European colleagues on further research into this area.<\/p> <p> As the youngest Member in the House, as well as the youngest Deputy elected in quite some time, I am hopeful the work we are doing now, as a society and as a backbencher supporting the Government, at an international level will in the future give us a better ability to deal with upcoming illnesses, diseases and new pandemics.  Having the template of this task force is good for the country and for public health.<\/p> <p> It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the extraordinary efforts put in by our front-line care staff and those working on the front line of the Covid-19 pandemic.  They have borne the brunt and the consequences of this.  We have to support them in every way possible.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister well.  The work he is doing will never be forgotten.  He might not be thanked for it for some time.  I must admit that the one thing I heard many of my colleagues here talking about was around misinformation.  It is highly irresponsible for Members of this House, without any basis of fact or science, to be engaging in that style of debate.<\/p> <p> I am conscious that this is my final time speaking here for 2020.  I wish everybody in the Houses of the Oireachtas and my constituents a very happy and peaceful Christmas.  I am very hopeful that next year will bring some better times for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700056#EEE00300","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608226800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>This year will go down in history as one of the toughest the world has faced in generations.  The election for the D&aacute;il was only in February but it feels like a lifetime ago now.  This is a year many of us would like to forget.  Ireland has seen more than 76,000 cases of Covid and more than 2,000 deaths from it.  The losses endured by thousands of families are unimaginable.  Loved ones snatched away by a virus that has swept the globe and left no corner untarnished.  The damage to the financial and employment situation of households across the country is almost beyond counting.<\/p>  <p>  There is now a flickering light, however, at the end of the tunnel.  The global medical community has come together in a way never seen before.  We now have a vaccine that will help break the back of Covid and allow us to start thinking about a future free of this wretched and debilitating illness.<\/p>  <p>  Some have asked how we were able to come up with the vaccine so fast when vaccines for other diseases can take years to create or may never be found.  The answer is simple.  The world has never had to face a problem like Covid-19.  Never before has so much energy, know-how, money and resources been powered into finding an answer to a medical problem.  Covid effectively locked down the world.  This could not be allowed to continue.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has unveiled its plans to roll out a vaccine to the whole of the State.  While I welcome the plan, I would have preferred more detail particularly as to how GPs and the healthcare workforce will be utilised in vaccinating millions of people.  Greater clarity is needed on what specific medical conditions will be prioritised and how those who have recovered from Covid already will fit in.  Questions remain over the registration process and what is considered an essential business.<\/p>  <p>  As Chair of the Oireachtas health committee, I hope I can be of help in asking some of the questions the public want answered and help to address their fears.  It is only natural there will be real fears.  There will be those who have legitimate fears about the vaccine.  They may be wary of doctors and injections in general.  They may be fearful of this new and unknown Covid vaccine and still making up their mind about it.  I urge all of those people to listen to the medical experts, to trust in the science and voice their fears to all of us collectively in order we can answer some of their deep-rooted concerns.<\/p>  <p>  There will also be those who will seek to spread false information, to sow fear and doubt.  We saw this in the early days of the pandemic.  Some groups chose to frighten or sell half-baked ideas to confuse in order to further their own aims and agendas.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  The mass vaccination programme is the only option we have to stamp out Covid and get life as close to the old normal as we can.<\/p>  <p>  I call on anyone who would knowingly spread disinformation to stop and think about the real damage and harm they are doing.  That is a message which must be echoed by all parties and none in this House.  Vaccines are safe.  They are one of the most effective weapons in the fight against disease.  Smallpox, polio and TB are viruses which have been either eradicated or banished to the poorest or remotest parts of the world by vaccines.  It is important this work continues.  Vaccines are not to be feared.  I will be taking that vaccine when my number comes up in the roll-out.  I encourage all others to do the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700057#FFF00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1608226800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on these statements this evening.  However, I would make the point that it is not the ideal format for us.  There are two major issues facing the country.  They are being discussed here tonight at the tail end of the D&aacute;il session and they are only statements.  We are going into an almost four-week break over Christmas.  It would have been really helpful if in both cases, the vaccine and Brexit, we could have had a question and answer session.  It is quite unsatisfactory and difficult for the rest of us just to deal with this because of the failure to provide that opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Those of us who are members of the health committee met with a number of the key people involved on Wednesday.  Unfortunately, there was not an awful lot more information forthcoming at that stage.  It was unsatisfactory.  We have not had a briefing for quite a long time.  It would have been helpful to have a briefing on the vaccine strategy.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind over the recess and, if the need arises, that he would arrange a briefing for us.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome the vaccine strategy has been announced.  We await the further detail.  The excitement and the welcome has to be tempered with a realisation of just where we are at the moment too.  We are facing into a lifting of restrictions tomorrow, a Christmas period when people will be mixing to a much greater extent than they have been recently.  We are in a situation where all of the indicators are worryingly going in the wrong direction, however.  We have not heard this evening's figures yet but the Minister talked earlier about the R number, as well as several of the underlying indicators being of concern.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, I would just be afraid that, while the vaccine is really welcome and offers people hope for the future, it is important that we bear in mind that it is for the future, not now.  There may have been too much talking up of the vaccine at this point.  When it starts to be administered, hopefully by the end of the year, only a tiny number of vaccines, 5,000 will be available.  We do not have any idea about the scheduling of further deliveries.  It would be helpful if we got information about the likely schedule, the phasing, the time delay between putting in an order and approval from the company, as well as getting those orders delivered.  It could be well into the middle of next year by the time the general population is vaccinated.<\/p> <p>It is a long way to go until then.<\/p> <p> A very clear message must go out about the very real dangers over the coming weeks.  We see what is happening in the North, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.  We are about to embark on a period of opening up.  Irish people are very sociable.  We all want to see our families and do those pleasant things.  We just have to keep repeating the messages, and I am not sure the messages are getting out there clearly enough.  In terms of limiting contact with other households and household visits, it is not three households in the morning and another three households in the afternoon or the next day.  All of this needs to be kept at the forefront of people's minds.  More could be done in this regard.<\/p> <p> With regard to the vaccine strategy itself, there are many questions that have not yet been answered.  I am particularly concerned about the IT system to underpin the vaccine strategy.  We do not know when it will be finalised with IBM and Salesforce.  There are issues with regard to what data will be gathered, how there will be unique identifiers, and the problems associated with the fact we do not have disease registers.  It is a self-registration programme.  How will we cross-check those registering with those who have particular underlying health conditions?  What about those who do not register?  There will be people who do not get those messages or for whatever reason do not come forward.  How do we encourage those people to come forward for the vaccine?<\/p> <p> What about those who do not have access to computers or who may not be computer savvy?  Many of these people are concerned about how they register.  There is no information available.  Clearly people want to register and get into the system as quickly as possible but those questions have not been answered.  There are also questions about data protection.  It is not clear that the issue has been resolved.  We are still waiting to hear from the Data Protection Commissioner.  If there are concerns about the security of data, it will discourage people from coming forward.  We need to be absolutely clear that the system is secure and safe.<\/p> <p> There are a few other points that need to be raised.  An issue that has come to the fore is the safety of the vaccines in respect of fertility.  We know pregnant people are at the end of the list.  We also know it is not advisable for people who are breastfeeding.  There are question marks raised about people considering planning a pregnancy or fertility treatment.  We need clarification on these issues as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> The other point I want to raise is one I raised last week with regard to teenagers aged under 18 with underlying health conditions.  I was hopeful there would be progress on this and that there would be a positive announcement this week.  Many families in this situation were hopeful the Minister might say something on it this week.  He undertook to speak to the Chief Medical Officer about it.  It really would be very helpful if at least those aged 16 and 17 with underlying health conditions could be included.  There is an overall question about people with disabilities as opposed to underlying health conditions, especially people with Down's syndrome who are at greater risk.  There does not seem to be provision for people in this category at this stage.  It is something that needs to be addressed very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700057#FFF00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608227400,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I am reflecting a little bit on Deputy O'Connor's contribution as he said it would be his last contribution for the year.  It makes us reflect on the year we have had.  Certainly the election in February seems more than just a number of months ago.  Since then, we have had to tackle two major issues.  One is the impact of the virus itself, and I believe we have managed the virus well in this country.  The numbers and comparisons with other European countries over recent weeks have shown we have managed the virus well.  We should not be triumphalist about it and things will change over time.  As the previous speaker said, the level of interaction we see in the city would cause some concern, and perhaps we came out of the second restricted period with a more relaxed attitude than we did coming out of the first.  All that being said, the numbers do speak for themselves and we have managed the virus well.<\/p>  <p>  The other major issue is that an economic price has been paid for this by many people.  People have lost their jobs.  People have been made redundant.  People have lost income.  Again, we have managed some of the worst elements of this economic impact with economic supports for jobs such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, the restart grant and, principally, the pandemic unemployment payment, which I believe we should look at as being a progressive form of basic income.<\/p>  <p>  On this second score of managing the economic hardships, we have done well.  Therefore, it bodes well heading into this third phase, where we will start to roll out the vaccine, that equally we should have confidence in this country's ability to deliver the vaccine programme.  It should be summed up as two sides of a coin.  One side is public support for the campaign and the other is public service excellence in delivering the vaccine campaign.  There are a number of elements in both of these points.  On public support, of course there needs to be leadership and we have to be careful that those who have genuine concerns about the vaccine need to be won over.  They need to be persuaded that their genuine concerns can be answered in a rational and reasonable way.  We can explain how the vaccine can be another tool, along with a face mask and 2 m social distancing.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to this conversation, we have to differentiate between people with genuine concerns and those who do not want to be persuaded because of an ideological opposition to vaccination or because they took an earlier position that they do not believe Covid is as serious as we do.  I do not know how the people in this category have come to that conclusion.  Vaccine deniers and Covid deniers have their own form of twisted logic.  The conversation with them should not overtake the genuine conversation we have to have with people who have genuine concerns.  In the public health messaging we need to make sure we concentrate on the middle ground and those with genuine questions and the questions we can genuinely answer and that we do not get caught with people who want a black-and-white argument and do not want sophisticated and nuanced answers.  They just want to be Covid deniers and vaccine deniers.<\/p>  <p>  In the public support message we need to talk about trusted advisers.  We need to talk about GPs, pharmacists and health professionals in people's families, and empower them with the simple messaging that the vaccine is an additional tool and will be crucial in us tackling the virus.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of certification, data protection and the technology is very important. There are always restrictions with any IT system or data management system but they should not dictate the ambition of the roll-out programme.  We need to make sure we record everyone who takes the vaccination.  If people wish to have evidence they have taken the vaccination, we need to make it available to them.  A big part of the pandemic has been people associating with other people who they trust and know are being responsible in the pandemic and, therefore, are willing to be part of their bubble and to trust them.<\/p> <p>That is the way we will make progress on the vaccine also.  If I am going to be with other people in a social setting I will want to be with people who I trust also availed of the vaccine.<\/p> <p> We should not be overly concerned about passports and certificates.  That is not the way this country has dealt with this crisis to date.  There will be times when we will need to provide evidence that we have taken the vaccine and that should be available as part of the IT and administration systems.  However, if we return to the idea of environments we can control and in which we can have trust, we will not need that overly-prescriptive approach.  However, there are groups that are not in that position.  I refer to those who, either in their work or because of where they live, are put in a position where they are forced to be in an environment with people they may not have the information or knowledge to trust.<\/p> <p> I welcome the prioritisation given by the task force.  I have great experience of dealing with Professor Brian MacCraith.  As a former president of DCU he had great confidence in administering that university and I hope that he and all the people on the task force will bring all that skill to it.<\/p> <p> Looking at the prioritisation and the categorisation, it would appear that priority is being given to small groups first and expanding out to those people who cannot control the environment around them.  I refer to those people who live in congregated settings or who, because of their housing condition or their health, are forced to share space with other people or those who work in those environments.  We must make sure that they can avail of the vaccine earlier than others.<\/p> <p> There is always a different focus brought by different sectoral groups in terms of the restrictions that should and should not apply.  I imagine the same will happen with vaccination but if we trust the prioritisation of the task force we can have confidence that they will deliver the programme to those people who need it most.<\/p> <p> We need to examine the definition of key workers, which is essential.  The one area I talk about most is education.  Teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, have put themselves in a position where social distancing is possible most of the time but they are in contact with large groups of people, perhaps larger groups of people than most people have been in contact with.  I would equate bus drivers and other transport workers in the same category.  Teachers and SNAs must be able to continue to have confidence that schools will remain open, and they should remain open.  I despair at the constant rumour mill of schools possibly closing and not closing.  The Government has made a commitment to keep schools open as long as is possible and in a safe a manner as possible.  I wish we would continue to hear that message rather than the constant attempts to shorten weeks and times.<\/p> <p> On that issue, if that commitment is being given, equally we should stand by the teachers and the SNAs who are in that position.  Social distancing is possible some of the time but there are occasions when it is not.  When I asked my 11 year old daughter about the conditions in her school she said, &ldquo;Well, you know, the babies cannot keep the social distance the same as the rest of us&rdquo;.  That is the reality.  Younger children in schools may breach the distance more than others.  I ask that the position of key workers be examined and fleshed out.  I know every group will want to be in that category.  The political reality is that there will be calls and lobbying from every group but the education sector has been one of the real success stories of this pandemic in terms of how we have managed to respond to it.  I would like to see them and the risk that they take acknowledged in the vaccination programme.<\/p> <p> Equally, there are those people who have underlying conditions or medical conditions who will seek protection.  I ask the Minister to examine their position.<\/p> <p> The categorisation is very clear.  Although one might be in category seven, eight or nine, the numbers above that are quite small.  That is because we focus the need on those people who need it most.  As we get to each category, more and more people are brought into the programme.  Those are the practical realities of delivering the programme.<\/p> <p> I said at the outset that the country has done well in managing the virus and the economic impact of the virus.  I am confident that we will do well again in administering this vaccination programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700058#GGG00200","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608228000,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to speak about the Covid-19 vaccine.  I want to state on the record that as soon as it is available to me personally, I will be taking the vaccine.  When the swine flu vaccine came out 11 years ago, I was one of those people deemed a vulnerable person and myself and my baby daughter were some of the people who were vaccinated.  I know people have concerns about the vaccine but I would tell them to follow the medical advice and the advice of the experts.  They are the people we are putting our trust in and I will certainly be putting my trust in them.<\/p>  <p>  This has been a very tough year for everyone.  I very much hope that the development of these vaccines is the light at the end of the tunnel for people but I want to raise a few issues with the Minister.  The Government needs to commit to listen to people on the ground and to take on board what they are saying.  There has been much talk in recent days about concern for vulnerable people and groups, and we need to listen to them.  That needs to be a group effort and as a country we need to come together.  Excluding certain groups or pushing them down the list is not the way to do that.  Engaging with people on the ground and letting them have their say is vital to ensuring significant uptake of the vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister that consideration be given to those in active addiction and to set up an outreach programme that will ensure they will take up the vaccine when possible.  It is very important that we reach people.  We need to make sure that the vaccine is not just available but also accessible.  Those in active addiction need to be reached out to and consideration must be given to their specific vulnerabilities when determining how the order will be rolled out.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that we keep those in addiction in mind.  It took the Minister months to give details of funding that was promised to addiction groups.  I contacted him weekly on the issue.  Those groups had been crying out for funding.  The same issue arose with regard to the guidelines for peer support meetings for those in recovery including Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and Smart Recovery Ireland, which are essential, yet it took the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, months to give those groups the go-ahead to meet.<\/p>  <p>  I raise concerns about comments the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, made with regard to those in recovery.  He stated that these people were medically vulnerable.  That was extremely harmful to many people who have been in recovery for a long time or in recovery for behavioural addiction.  They have contacted me to say they were upset by the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  I ask the Minister of State again, as I have done previously, to withdraw those comments.  Being in recovery does not automatically make one medically vulnerable.  This is clear because they are not a priority for the vaccine roll-out and they are not looking to be a priority.  It is vital that we listen to the people on the ground and that we try to bring everyone together.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, in the past few days we have seen an increase in positive rates.  I ask everyone to enjoy their Christmas.  I very much hope they do because it has been a very tough year but I ask them to consider and protect the most vulnerable and to manage their contacts and their social distancing.<\/p> <p>I ask people to be considerate when they are out.  It is a tough time for people who have to work over Christmas, whether in hospitals, restaurants or any other job.  It will be harder this year.  I request that people respect those workers and treat them with the dignity they deserve.<\/p> <p> On a personal note, it has been a tough, busy year for the Minister, his family, the HSE, NPHET and all the groups he has worked with.  Even though we might not always agree on anything, I wish the Minister and all those around him a happy and hopefully safe Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700059#HHH00200","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608228600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den D&aacute;il gur glacadh leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo anocht.

A safe and effective vaccine is our best chance to beat the coronavirus and return to our normal lives.  As I have said repeatedly, I join the vast majority of colleagues in this House in saying that when a vaccine is available to me, I will take it, and I look forward to that day very much.  The European Commission has provided an unprecedented response to the pandemic.  The European Commission and member states have agreed to joint action at European Union level.  The Commission has planned a centralised EU approach to securing supplies and providing support for the development of a vaccine.  Significant funding for this has come from Europe's emergency support instrument.<\/p><p>The Commission has worked tirelessly to secure doses of vaccines that can be shared with all on a fair basis.  It has worked closely with pharmaceutical companies and the European Medicines Agency to ensure not just that an effective vaccine is available as soon as possible, but that a safe vaccine is available as soon as possible.  As with any vaccine, the vaccine candidates have gone through and are going through rigorous scientific assessment before being made available to the public.  I thank every one of the participants in the clinical trials.  I am sure there are some in Ireland.  Tens of thousands of people across the world have taken on these risks that some people have said they are not willing to take, so that this can be proven to work and to be safe for the rest of us, and very successfully in this case.<\/p><p>The European Commission has entered into advance purchase agreements with individual vaccine producers on behalf of us all.  In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe, at a given price, the European Commission is financing part of the up-front costs faced by vaccine producers from the emergency support instrument.  The funding is considered as a down payment on vaccines that will be purchased by member states, such as Ireland.  The approach decreased risk for companies and speeds up and increases manufacturing capacity.  It is our European Commission, and on behalf of us all it has secured agreements with six vaccine developers, most of which are now household names, including AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Sanofi, Pfizer, CureVac and Moderna.  More may come.  The recent positive announcements of effective vaccines for Covid-19 and the conclusion of these arrangements is warmly welcomed by everybody in this House.<\/p><p>All member states of the European Union have access to vaccines at the same time and distribution will be done on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis to ensure fair access.  Yesterday, the Commission's President, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the EU's 27 member countries aimed to start vaccinations at approximately the same time in a sign of unity.  She had discussions with the Taoiseach about this the day before.  In her statement to the European Parliament, the President of the Commission said that to get to the end of the pandemic, we need approximately 70% of the population to be vaccinated.  This is a substantial task.  Our medics and scientists have started the ball rolling, but it is up to all of us to work together, both as individuals and member states, to make sure that this happens.<\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency, which regulates the release of medicines in the EU, is bringing forward to next Monday a special meeting originally planned for a week later to discuss provisional approval for the Pfizer vaccine.  It is true that European member states have the option to go before the EMA under emergency rules, but the Commission wants a co-ordinated roll-out across the European Union to ensure nobody is left behind.  It is an important principle that everybody has safe access to this.<\/p><p>The European Council and the General Affairs Council, where I sit, have continually underlined the importance of preparation for the timely deployment and distribution of vaccines, including the development of vaccine strategies, which is the focus of the debate tonight, to ensure vaccines are available to people in the European Union in good time and in a co-ordinated manner.  This is exactly what the Government has done with our own Covid-19 taskforce.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to the Taoiseach for his leadership, and to my good friend, Professor Brian MacCraith, for his public service.  I think it is fair to say that he has transformed Dublin City University.  It is a world-leading young university.  His skills are exactly the skills that we need, with a friendly, non-confrontational approach that is grounded in scientific assessment and reality, and in the scientific method.  I think we can be certain of getting that from Professor MacCraith.<\/p><p>It is important that we give as much clear information as possible on vaccines to counter disinformation.  I sincerely hope that we do not hear disinformation in the D&aacute;il, or insulting talk about risks.  There are always risks but a greater risk has been taken on by many ordinary men and women in clinical trials.  They have paved the way for the rest of us.<\/p><p>The Commission will put in place a common reporting framework and a platform to monitor the effectiveness of national strategies and to share best practices.  The conclusions of the first review of national vaccine plans will be presented in the second half of this month.  The Taoiseach would say, and I would say at the General Affairs Council and know the Minister for Health would agree, that the sharing of best practice from across the European Union and of experience is important, and plays a key role in what we are doing.  It is a key benefit of our European Union membership.<\/p><p>The arrival of vaccines does not mean that the pandemic is over.  The epidemiological situation in Europe is worrying.  It is worrying in this country too.  Considerable efforts are being made across the European Union.  When I was in Brussels last week, there was not a soul on the streets after 10 p.m.  There is a curfew.  Restaurants and bars are shut.  Similar measures have been introduced in Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries.  There is a dire situation in Europe that can only be relieved by the production of a vaccine.<\/p><p>The co-ordination of efforts at EU level has been successful so far.  Member states want to strengthen this as much as we can.  Everybody wants to lift restrictions, to return to normal travel and to get tourism back, as the health situation allows.<\/p><p>Vaccination should be treated as a global public good.  It is no good if we all get vaccinated if some poor country in Africa, or indeed another part of Europe, is not able to avail of the vaccine.  If we are not all vaccinated or do not all have the opportunity, it loses its effectiveness.  The COVAX facility is a good strategy but we need to keep working on that to make sure we live up to its ideals.<\/p><p>Disinformation on the coronavirus is thriving.  It is important to get updated information from authoritative sources only, such as <i>hse.ie<\/i>and <i>who.int<\/i>.  I encourage everyone to follow the public health advice.  It is based on scientific rigour, significant experience and the successful science behind vaccines over the last century.  Where has polio gone?  Smallpox has also all but disappeared.  Diseases that were debilitating and killers have been eliminated or much reduced because of vaccines.  I was proud to stand up for the HPV vaccine throughout its history and while I certainly met concerned constituents, a quick conversation with Professor John Crown about the dangers of cervical cancer certainly corrected any misapprehensions that one may have had.<\/p> <p>We can look forward to a future without cervical cancer and similar diseases because of the roll-out of the HPV vaccine, which at the time was sought and campaigned for by tens of thousands of Irish people.  I am proud supporter, not just of vaccines, but of scientific method and scientific reality.  Not all of the candidate vaccines will be approved by the European Medicines Agency but many of them will.  We can rely on testing and scientific method challenging all of the assumptions and making sure the vaccines that are on the market are safe and effective and that they put an end to the pandemic.<\/p> <p> I have great respect the Rural Independent Group Deputies but I was surprised to learn that the motion they tabled yesterday referenced the reopening of pubs, which is undoubtedly a significant issue, but there was no mention of vaccines.  We are not going to get out of this pandemic or sort out all of the issues it has brought upon us unless we can get vaccine roll-out. <\/p> <p> I express my solidarity and support for families that have been grievously affected Covid-19.  Thousands of people in this country have died, in many cases leaving families behind and there are other people who are very sick still with ongoing issues.  I know of one person who had an amputation as a result of coronavirus.  It is a serious illness.  We must stick together and do our best for the next few weeks and months until the vaccine becomes available in order that we can eliminate the virus.<\/p> <p> The solidarity that we have shown together in the European Union, working together, buying medicines together and getting that medicine for a good price, sharing scientific and practical expertise, is a wonderful thing to behold.  It is of immense benefit to Irish and European citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700060#JJJ00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608229200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I welcome the Covid-19 task force and I look forward to getting the vaccine jab when it is my turn.  This time last year we could not have imagined what we would be facing, not alone the deaths but the change in life as we know it.  This virus has reminded us how fragile and interdependent we are.<\/p>  <p>  Across the world, vaccines have changed lives, virtually eradicating diseases that devastated earlier generations.  It is a medical fact that some people will not be able to get the vaccine.  Everyone who can be vaccinated against Covid-19 should be vaccinated.  We do it for ourselves and for others too.  There has been too much suffering and too much death for people to prevaricate.  I think of the people, men and women, who died in north Kildare in nursing homes.  We paid a heavy toll in Kildare in comparison with the rest of the country.  Each one of those people was unique and loved, as stated by our wonderful Kildare coroner, Dr. Denis Cusack.  Tonight, I pay tribute to them, their families and the staff who put their own lives at risk to look after those people.  Many of those staff are highly skilled but poorly paid.<\/p>  <p>  This pandemic has shown us what Governments can achieve when they work together and with experts for the common cause of public health and the chequebook is open.  The chequebook was open because this coronavirus affects the economies of the developed world.  If we can apply the same level of global mutual co-operation towards eradicating poverty and promoting rights, one can only imagine what we could achieve.  I hope and pray that will happen.  We could and should do that.<\/p>  <p>  It will be some time before the vaccine is rolled out to everybody.  I urge people to take extra care this Christmas.  I heard a HSE official say earlier that people should only meet other people they would trust with their lives.  That is good advice.  Christmas time is about the birth of a baby.  It is a time of hope.  Next year will be the year of hope.  I welcome the Covid-19 task force and I wish it well.  I also wish the Minister well and I thank him for the help he gave me throughout the year with various issues in north Kildare.<\/p>  <p>  Let us roll up our sleeves, literally and metaphorically, and get this done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700061#KKK00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1608229200,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I want to add my voice to much of what has been said.

Like others, my thoughts are with those who have lost people during this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that we are having this discussion.  There was a point when we would not have thought it possible that we would be here in December talking about possibility of the vaccine being rolled out across Europe on 27, 28 and 29 December.  Like others, when it is my time I will be only too delighted to take the vaccine.  I accept that there are people with views to the contrary.  We need to ensure the experts are front and centre in ensuring the truth is out there in regard to the vaccines.  Vaccines save lives.<\/p>  <p>  I wish Professor Brian MacCraith the best of luck.  Alongside the Minister, he and his team have a huge job to do in the roll-out of the vaccine to those on the priority list, which will need to be reviewed into the future.  There will also be need for a review of the structures and processes to ensure vaccination is rolled-out to everybody.  We need to make it as accessible as possible and we need to ensure that this happens on a global basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700061#KKK00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1608229200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I am happy to be here on this very auspicious occasion.  It is an historic event for the country.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Covid-19 task force and the national Covid-19 vaccination programme.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to make six points.  First, I welcome the publication of the high level strategy document and the more operationally focused implementation plan.  In the short timeframe of four weeks, Professor Brian MacCraith and his team have come up with two comprehensive pathways that are hugely important.  They deserve a lot of credit.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the European Medicines Agency, EMA, is on the cusp of approving, provisionally, the use of one of the candidate vaccines, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  As we have heard, this may happen on Monday.  This is a positive step.  More important, it is likely that before year end people in Ireland will be vaccinated.  Even three months ago, that was unthinkable in this jurisdiction.  It is full marks so far in terms of my first point.<\/p>  <p>  Second, it is important that vaccination is completely voluntary.  There will be no mandatory vaccination, which is positive.  That is important.  Coupled with that, the vaccine will be free for recipients at the point of administration.  This is essential.  A person's financial means should never be a factor in determining whether he or she should or should not get a vaccine.  Again, this is a very positive development. <\/p>  <p>  Third, I want to focus on the vaccine allocation strategy.  It is correct and appropriate that those who are most likely to contract the illness or those who are most vulnerable if they contract it, should be at the front of the queue.  It is correct that those who are 65 and over in residential care settings are the first priority.  I have no issue with that.  I agree that the second priority should be our front-line healthcare workers and that the third priority should be those over 70 in the general public.  There is one group of workers I would like to highlight.  I know there are many sectoral interests competing in regard to the identify of key workers but the group of people I am speaking about are regularly forgotten about.  They are loyal, they rarely grumble and they just soldier on.  This group is peacekeeping troops overseas, of whom there are approximately 600.<\/p> <p>The numbers fluctuate over the year.  The next large contingent to deploy will go to Syria at the end of March next year.  The reason these personnel are so important from a vaccination perspective is that, first, they are deployed to very remote and very hostile countries, including countries which have a much higher prevalence of Covid-19 than we do in Ireland.  Second, they are deployed to resource-poor countries that have a much-reduced medical capacity compared with what we have in this country.  If our troops get ill overseas, they are at much higher risk.  Third, and most important, they are the only group of workers in the State who, before they deploy on a six-month tour of duty overseas, must spend two weeks in strict, mandatory, supervised quarantine in a military installation in Ireland.  This means they are away from their families for six and a half months in total.  If we could shave those initial two weeks off by giving them a vaccination, it would be hugely appreciated by the military community.  Anything the Minister can do from that perspective would be greatly appreciated.<\/p> <p> The fourth point I wish to raise relates to workforce planning.  I am aware that Professor MacCraith has done a lot of work in this regard already.  If there was one bit of advice I could give the Minister, it would be to try, if he can at all, not to redeploy front-line staff from the health services to the vaccination programme.  There is no point in robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We are only going to store up further problems downstream if we do so.  Our waiting lists are long enough as it is without adding to the problem.  I respectfully suggest that retired healthcare professionals should be used as well as locum agencies.  There are many doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who are not working full-time in the sector and would appreciate being part of the national effort to get the vaccination programme over the line.  I welcome that the deployment of pharmacists is being seriously considered.  It is a very progressive and modernising thing to do.<\/p> <p> My fifth point is in regard to the ICT system, which has been mentioned by other speakers.  We are looking at an off-the-shelf purchase and that makes a lot of sense.  One point I would raise is that we have an unfortunate tradition in this country of patients being lost to follow-up as they move through a very complicated pathway system.  We need a sophisticated ICT system to track, monitor and evaluate how things are proceeding, particularly in light of the fact that we are going to have at least five different types of vaccines and perhaps even a sixth one.  We need an ICT system that is fit for purpose and in respect of which proper training is provided for the people using it.<\/p> <p> My final point concerns the public engagement and communication plan, which is absolutely critical.  It is essential that people be made aware that a rigorous and robust testing system has been put in place, that the vaccines are safe and that the chances of an adverse reaction are minuscule.  If a person gets an adverse reaction, it can be managed satisfactorily.  I am very happy to get the vaccine when my turn comes.  I am in the unusual position that I am also happy to add my name to the list to administer the vaccine, should that become necessary.<\/p> <p> This is a wonderful day for the country.  Throughout the crisis, we have embraced science and enlightenment and now we can reap our just rewards.  There should be a collective sense of achievement in this.  It was the ultimate team performance.  As this is my last contribution in the House in 2020, I wish the Minister and Minister of State and their families the very best over Christmas, and the same to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and all Deputies and staff present.  We have been through a very rough year and I wish everybody a very peaceful and happy Christmas, particularly the front-line healthcare workers who have protected and supported the population over the past nine months.  It has been a fantastic achievement.  Here is to a much better 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700061#KKK00400","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608229800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their statements.  We have long talked about needing tools to live with Covid.  Now we can begin to look forward to using vaccination as another tool in the Covid-19 battle.  It really has been a battle, and 2020 will go down in the history books as such.  It has been a battle for all the people who have gone through so much, between sickness, bereavement and losing jobs.  It really has been an horrific year.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the news that work is well under way by the task force to develop plans to ensure that once we have the appropriate authorisation from the European Medicines Agency, we can commence the vaccination programme in line with the expected availability of the vaccines in 2021.  The impact of the vaccines has been overwhelming in terms of the protection they offer from a wide variety of very significant diseases.  It is important that people get the correct information from their GPs and other healthcare professionals.  The success of the campaign requires exceptional logistical and communications planning.  GPs and pharmacists must be included in the planning and roll-out.  It is very reassuring that Ireland is actively involved in the EU procurement exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure suitable, safe and effective vaccines in sufficient quantities to combat Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  We need the public to know that we will only be using Covid-19 vaccines that comply with all the requirements of quality and safety set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation.  It is most welcome that things are moving very quickly in this regard, with dates moving forward all the time.  We need timely implementation of a Covid-19 immunisation programme as soon as one or more vaccines in the EU portfolio are approved for use.  I have a concern about the policies being developed regarding the order in which people should be offered vaccination.  I welcome that priority groups will be vaccinated first, including front-line healthcare workers and people who are most at risk from serious infection if they catch Covid-19.  However, I am very concerned that the current provisional vaccine allocation group document does not include people with Down's syndrome in the group of people aged between 18 and 64 with certain medical conditions.  I got a telephone call about that the other day and I ask the Minister to come back to me on it.  It may already have been highlighted to him.<\/p>  <p>  I am also very concerned that people living with disabilities are seventh on the list.  While I welcome front-line workers getting the vaccine first, which is 100% right, it is important that those with disabilities get it as early as possible.  Many people with increased risk of severe disease due to Covid-19 have spent most of this year in isolation, often to the detriment of their mental health and, in some cases, causing significant regression.  It is imperative that they have the opportunity to return safely to work, access services and engage in the social and recreational aspects of daily living at the earliest possible opportunity.  One of the main issues I encountered during the Covid period was the telephone calls from families with children or adults with disabilities.  It was all about the lack of services and respite.  It is important that people with disabilities get the vaccine as soon as possible, as well as front-line workers, the elderly and so on.  If we are all in it together and we get a proper programme in place, we can do this and maybe even do it more quickly than is currently planned.  I hope we can look at the plan carefully as we move forward.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the pharmaceutical, science and research sectors as well as our health sector on their hard work during this crisis.  Due to the urgency posed by the pandemic, exceptional efforts are ongoing to develop Covid-19 vaccines and make them available as soon as possible.  Unprecedented levels of scientific research and collaboration, investment and early proactive engagement between vaccine developers and regulators have helped to speed up development and ensure that quality, safety and effectiveness are not compromised.  That is most welcome.<\/p>  <p>  When my turn comes to avail of the vaccine, I will take it.  I would say to everyone that this is really a good news story.  There is not a family in Ireland that has not been affected by Covid-19.  I have been at some of the funerals and it has been horrific for people.  We need to make sure the vaccination programme is rolled out with proper information in order that people can access it as soon as possible.  I wish everyone here a happy Christmas.  It has been a hard year and things will be different in 2021, please God, in the sense that we hope to be back on track with employment and there will not be the same amount of sickness as we have seen this year.  I wish those who get the first vaccinations the very best as they offer hope to us all.  I wish the Minister and Minister of State a happy Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700062#LLL00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1608229800,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.  This is my last contribution in the D&aacute;il in 2020.  I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Ceann Comhairle all the staff and all my colleagues the very best for the Christmas period.  It will be a well-earned break for many people following a very difficult time for us all.<\/p> <p> On the vaccine, I am delighted to get the opportunity to have a discussion about it.  I wish we had a little bit more time but we have something here and we must avail of the opportunity that we have.  I have been asked by the media as to whether I was taking the vaccine.  My answer was that I was not until I knew what I was taking and I am still strongly of that view.  I would advise anybody before they take any medication, especially something as big as this in our lives, that they look at all options and ensure that they are happy.  I know that 70% of people are happy to take the vaccine and I will certainly never stop anybody from taking anything like a vaccine of this sort if they are comfortable with it.  It would be totally wrong of me to do so.<\/p> <p> I am concerned, however, and have conveyed this concern to every media outlet but they have forgotten to run that piece, about the 25% to 30% who are saying that they are either fearful or will not take the vaccine.  Some of that 25% to 30% will never be convinced, but we certainly need to spend time addressing their concerns.  It would be very wrong of us if we did not allay those fears.  I was listening to the initial talk about the vaccine probably three weeks ago when it was very much coming under discussion in Ireland and there was a strong concentration on the 70% and the 30% were forgotten.  I am convinced that if we can explain this issue and allay some of the fears that are out there, if it is humanly possible to do that, then that 30% could be 20% or 15%.<\/p> <p> My worry is where I have listened to some of the Deputies here tonight who were forceful, such as Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, and were flippant about the whole thing.  That is the wrong attitude to have and that is what happened last weekend.  We are all well used to being harassed a bit on social media, but there was a concerted effort by an Oireachtas Member in west Cork and by his political party, together many councillors who were criticising me.  They did not know my circumstances and I have an underlying health condition.  I cannot just walk in there and take this vaccine and think that it is okay for me.  I certainly have to take very strong advice as to whether it is suitable for me.  I was talking about the 25% or 30% who have worries and that we work towards bringing that percentage down, if it is humanly possible, but they were rubbishing all of that.<\/p> <p> It became a political football by immature politicians.  This is not a political football but a very serious vaccine.  We desperately need to come out of the position that we are in with Covid-19.  I urge every politician who is in the Oireachtas or who is a county councillor to consider everybody.  If someone comes before me on the street and says that they are taking the vaccine I will say well done to them.  Equally, if someone says he or she is worried about it, I will work with that person to try to allay his or her worries.  We have to be sure to act in a very mature way here because some have acted in a very immature way.  We need to work with the people and not work against them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700062#LLL00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608230400,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I, too, am happy to speak on this issue tonight although I am very critical that we did not have a question and answer session or a debate and had to fight tooth and nail to have this debate, albeit it is just statements with no answers from the Minister.  I am glad that the Minister has stayed for this debate.  It is the first debate where he and his group have waited to hear our own group.  It is very important that all voices are heard.<\/p>  <p>  We have not had great success but I compliment everyone and all front-line workers in the community, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fire service and the community groups who have worked so hard to try to reduce the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I sympathise with all the businesses in the leisure area and all of the musicians who cannot perform.<\/p>  <p>  I have a significant issue with the HSE and the way in which it handled this pandemic.  I am not happy that there has no airport testing or that countries like Canada do not let anybody in or out except family or someone very close to them.  We have no real follow-up protocols but have weaknesses.  We have railed against the antigen testing which could be quite simply done.  We have seen people who have tried to use that and are not allowed to do so.  We have seen the force of the law - I am not criticising An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na here - used to prevent people going on their way, like the public in Galway.  We have paid significant moneys to Chinese companies also for faulty PPE equipment.  These are significant areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach informed us that he has indemnified all of the vaccine companies, which I know is common practice, but we had no discussion on that.  We live in a democracy and have not had any debate or discussion about a no-fault compensation scheme for people if they become ill or have repercussions from the vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  We are also lucky to be part of a powerful Europe that could buy the vaccines, but what about the Third World countries?  Where is our respect for all human beings?  They are not going to get it, or how long will they be waiting for it?<\/p>  <p>  The nursing homes have been mentioned here as being first for the vaccine.  The nursing homes have been treated appallingly.  People were sent in by the HSE who had the vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  We are told that there were 2 million doses of the flu vaccine.  Some 1.4 million doses have been accounted for, which means that 600,000 doses are missing.  The HSE has been asked to make a statement in response to these different reports.  There are now between 8.5 million and 9 million doses of this vaccine.  How can we have faith in a HSE that is so dysfunctional, it was unable to administer the flu vaccine this year with the result that 600,000 doses are unaccounted for?  I have many questions about the roll-out of this vaccine and about how people might have confidence in it.  We must win over the people who have concerns.  We must talk to them and engage with them.  It is a matter for each person, with his or her GP or consultant, if necessary, if he or she has an underlying condition, whether to take this vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  A practice has crept in here, used by Deputy Kelly and others, of writing to all of our colleagues, and demanding that we provide an answer within a week.  That is bullying.  This is a democracy and we are all elected here with individual rights to represent our people and ourselves without being intimidated and being shouted down.  Some people are nice and most people are very respectful, but some are dismissive of anybody who has any issues.  We must bring the people with us.

I have read his vaccination strategy and implementation plan.  It is impressive and I wish him, the task force, and everybody involved well because this is the most important piece of work that the Minister and his Government will undertake during its term of office.  That is why I have previously called for a separate Ministry to take full and final responsibility to ensure effective, efficient, safe and timely roll-out of the vaccine.  Let me assure him that in no way does this question his competence or that of his Department.  The Minister already has a 24-7 job with very significant responsibilities.  We cannot get this wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation phase, and I have read through it, is multilayered and multifaceted.  There is a long vaccine supply chain starting with supply, then proper storage, and this is different for different vaccines.  We need to organise distribution at both national and local levels and to ensure that adequate numbers of vaccinators are in the right place at the right time.  There will be scheduling of appointments and the contacting of individuals, often more than once.  We need to ensure informed consent, arrangements for arrival, check-in, vaccination and follow-up.  We will then need to do that again because most of the vaccines will require a second dose.  As well as that, at an overall level, there must be effective governance and data protection systems, adequate regulatory processes, proper surveillance and monitoring, and, crucially, good clear communications and public engagement.<\/p>  <p> The reason I mention all these is because the undertaking is massive.  The Minister knows that.  Regarding those who already have 24-7 jobs, if there is going to be no new Ministry &ndash; it does not seem that there will be &ndash; the Minister should make sure he has all the resources necessary in his Department to get the job done.<\/p> <p> The other point I want to make is on public acceptance.  Many have spoken about this here.  We want to see a high take-up of the vaccine.  The best explanation I have heard was made by a Sinn F&eacute;in colleague two or three weeks ago.  The individual asked me to consider how I would react if I went to the doctor to get the usual prescription for a certain illness and the doctor said there was a new medication that targeted my illness very effectively and, from what could be seen, gave good results.  In such circumstances, the vast majority of us, including me, would say it was great and that we were happy with it.  The truth is that the position on a new vaccine is similar, but it is often viewed in a very different way.<\/p> <p> It is crucial that we take on board and listen to people's concerns about getting vaccinated themselves or about their families getting vaccinated.  It is not enough for us to play mother and say it is for their own good, or to play teacher or doctor and say we know what is best and that it is in their interest.  Getting some people to take this vaccine is about hearts as well as minds.  It is about how people feel as well as how they think.  Many different issues can be conflated.  Previous negative experiences, be they one's own or somebody else's, can have an impact on take-up.  We have to avoid being judgmental, even though there is a great temptation, and at the same time strongly encourage take-up of the vaccine.  A way to give a good example is by getting vaccinated oneself.  Social influencers will all play an important role.  Active listening matters, and active engagement is really important.  We will not change some people's minds by insisting on our superior knowledge.  If I do so, or anybody else does so, it only pushes people to find another reason to dig in and reject the viewpoint.  We have to be careful not to fall into that trap.<\/p> <p> We are in this together.  The approach has worked to a large extent up to now.  It can continue to do so.  People make up their own minds on vaccination for various reasons.  There is no hierarchy of reasons.  Clear, simple and straightforward information on all aspects of the vaccine is critical.  If there is a problem, large or small, as there will be, people should be informed.  People's trust is gained by always telling them how it is.  If the Minister does this, we will not spend hours in this Chamber or in other fora trying to get to the reality of the situation.  \"Transparency\" is a lovely word but, in reality, if we practice it, it engenders trust.  We can do this well.  I wish the Minister and all involved in this endeavour the very best.<\/p> <p> I listened to the Minister's speech, including his optimistic opening and his worrying conclusions.  When I hear that the R number is 1.2 or more, I become very concerned.  As the Minister said, we need to mind each other.  To that, I add that by minding each other, we mind ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700063#MMM01300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608231000,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those words of wisdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700064#NNN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1608231000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their considered questions and comments.  It is positive to have such a healthy conversation on this issue because there are many differing opinions.  We must ensure that the discussion is given the time to happen.<\/p>  <p>  It was no surprise to learn this week that \"unprecedented\" was chosen as the word of the year.  The new decade has not got off to the start any of us expected.  This year has been one of heartbreak for each and every one of us in different ways.  We have had to deal with the deaths of loved ones and, in many cases, we have been unable to attend their funerals.  We have seen the struggles and anguish as people lost jobs and as their businesses closed, in some cases for good.  We have dealt with isolation among family, friends and communities.  The simple joy of taking a walk or browsing in a shop can now put our health at risk.  However, perhaps the word of the year next year will be \"hope\".  As the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, said earlier, subject to approval the first vaccines could be administered before the end of the year.  We are aware that vaccines will not be a total cure for the disease but they are a step towards normality.  They are a step towards a time when we might not have to live in fear of what this disease might do to our loved ones, families or friends.<\/p>  <p>  I am thankful for the tremendous amount of hard work that has gone into our response to this pandemic.  People have made incredible sacrifices to help keep each other safe.  We must, however, be honest about how this vaccine will shape our behaviours in 2021.  While the roll-out ramps up over the next few months, we will need to stick to the public health measures that we all follow now.  We will need to keep safe by keeping our number of contacts low, washing our hands, wearing face coverings and maintaining social distance.<\/p>  <p>  I welcomed the announcement this week on the national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan.  A lot of hard work has gone into getting this right across government.  It has involved my Department, the HSE, several agencies and experts.  The strategy provides us with a clear path that we can follow for safe, effective and efficient vaccination of the population.  It allows us to do this while getting the best out of our health service and continuing with service delivery.  Vaccines will be administered in a range of settings that are best suited to the needs of the patient and the practical requirements of individual vaccines.  Long-term care facilities, large-scale healthcare sites, mass vaccination centres, GP clinics and community pharmacy settings will all be utilised.  There will be no charge for the vaccine.  Each person in Ireland will be entitled to receive it free of charge.  Vaccination will be carried out by registered healthcare professionals, all of whom will have received specific training in the administration of Covid-19 vaccines.<\/p>  <p>  The focus initially will be on administering the vaccine to those who need it the most.  As the Minister responsible for disabilities, I am aware that there have been queries on where people with disabilities stand in the vaccine allocation sequence.  It is important to note that, as outlined, people with disabilities are included in the plan although not explicitly listed as a defined group.  A person's age, whether he or she is in the long-term care setting and whether that person has a medical condition will dictate when he or she is vaccinated.  More broadly, though, the implementation plan is a live document that will change and grow.  Further subdivision of the cohorts outlined will be needed.  The strategy can adapt based on further expert advice and in accordance with the data and status of evidence that emerges over time.  Just as Deputy Berry said in his statement, perhaps the likes of peacekeeping troops going abroad might be considered in this regard.  It will all depend on how we move through the phases of our approach and the experiences in Ireland and abroad.<\/p>  <p>  The framework takes into account the current and evolving understanding of distinctive characteristics of Covid-19, its modes of transmission, the groups and individuals most at risk of severe disease or death, and the known characteristics of the candidate vaccines.  Scientists and clinicians will continue to play a key role in determining the ongoing evolution of vaccination prioritisation to ensure the optimal approach from a public health perspective.  Based on Ireland's experience with Covid-19 so far and the risks that the vulnerable and those in front-line roles in health and social care settings continue to face, it is essential that they be they be accorded the highest priority under the programme.  In the first wave of the pandemic in Ireland, 56% of those who died were people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities who were older than 65 years.<\/p> <p>They will be prioritised.  Healthcare workers have also borne the brunt of Covid-19 infections and they will be prioritised, as will people aged 70 and over because we know that the risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid-19 significantly increases with age.  The announcement that the European Medicines Agency will consider the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine at a meeting scheduled for next week brings us closer to a new phase in our response to the pandemic.  As part of the European Commission procurement exercise, Ireland has so far opted into five advance purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies with a process in place to opt into a sixth.  It is likely that early next year, we could have a number of vaccines approved.  We have made a great deal of progress over the past number of months and will continue to follow the medical and public health advice in order to keep each other safe in the new year.  We hope that the roll-out of the vaccines will prevent the most severe cases, hospitalisations and deaths associated with the disease and that we will be able to reopen our society and economy.<\/p> <p> I thank all Members of the House for the questions and issues they raised here this evening.

I promised to keep Members updated on Brexit developments and I think I have kept my word.  This is the 18th session of statements on Brexit that I have taken in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad since mid-2017.  In that period, the Government has also answered more than 3,000 Brexit-related parliamentary questions and I have chaired over 20 meetings of the Brexit stakeholder forum, which many of the Members of this House have also attended.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will give the House a detailed update on where matters currently stand on future relationship negotiations, but we believe that, with political will, there is now a path to a deal and welcome that the negotiating teams continue to make every effort to that end.  Fishing now remains the most difficult issue to resolve.  I hope the existing gaps can be closed through realism and a sense of fairness on both sides.<\/p>  <p>  Before turning to consider the state of readiness, I will briefly touch on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.  I pay tribute to the work of Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, Vice-President of the European Commission for Interinstitutional Relations, and Michael Gove, MP, and their teams.  The questions that arose in the context of implementing the protocol were complex and politically sensitive, with significant implications for Ireland, North and South.  Following intensive engagement, the EU and UK have reached agreement on all issues relating to the protocol.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier today, the joint committee on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement met to agree a number of decisions about the operation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The decisions taken address important issues, including the definition of goods deemed not to be at risk of entering the Single Market, the practical arrangements regarding the EU's presence in Northern Ireland when UK authorities implement checks and controls under the protocol and the exemption of some agricultural and fish subsidies from state aid rules.  This clear and agreed approach has delivered stable solutions on a range of issues, including arrangements to protect the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, to give supermarkets time to adjust and ensure supply chain resilience and to minimise the level of checks needed where these are necessary.  These assurances are of enormous importance to Northern Ireland traders, whether they are operating North-South or east-west.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to reiterate that, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, hopefully in the coming days, the protocol means that the new customs and regulatory controls coming into force for east-west trade will not apply to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This is a significant achievement, reflecting a key priority set by the Irish Government at the outset of the Brexit negotiations.  It is a positive outcome for Ireland, North and South.<\/p>  <p>  It is now more than four years since the UK voted to leave the EU and the Government began in earnest to prepare for the changes coming our way.  Over this time, our approach has been agile and adaptive, depending on where the negotiations were heading.  We have reviewed and refined our work as the changing circumstances required.  In May this year, as it became clear that the transition period would not be extended, the Government intensified its readiness work to prepare for a very limited deal or, indeed, no deal at all.  We set all of the relevant issues out in September's Brexit readiness action plan.  This is a valuable source of information and support for citizens and businesses.  With a weather eye to what is ahead, budget 2021 allocates unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit.  Some &euro;340 million is allocated in the budget for Brexit-related supports.  The Government will also establish a &euro;3.4 billion recovery fund to stimulate increased domestic demand and employment in response to Covid-19 and Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit brings many changes, but the most immediate and challenging arise from the UK leaving the Single Market and customs union.  In simple terms, this means that the seamless trade we enjoy with the UK today will end in two weeks' time.  All businesses, big and small, will be affected and if they do not prepare now, their trade will be disrupted, deliveries will be delayed and customers will be lost.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will give more detail on our stakeholder engagement and on the significant work that has gone into ensuring our ports and airports are as ready as they possibly can be.  We have engaged intensively with stakeholders, provided supports and will continue to work with all businesses and stakeholders in the remaining weeks and post transition.  However, I am concerned that many businesses, particularly in the SME sector, are not fully prepared.  I cannot stress enough that there is no outcome of the talks that will stop the introduction of new customs and regulatory regimes.<\/p> <p>The issue is not under negotiation as the UK has decided its best interests lie outside the Single Market and customs union.<\/p> <p> If the EU and UK fail to reach a deal, a broader set of challenges arises.  These challenges include tariffs and quotas and the loss of access for Irish fishing boats to UK waters.  Furthermore, the absence of a data adequacy decision would impact every public authority and business that exchanges data with the UK.<\/p> <p> Plans to manage issues that arise in the immediate day-one, week-one period and beyond are being finalised.  Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the HSE will have 24-hour operations in Dublin Port.  A range of call centres and advice lines will be available to traders and citizens.  Our embassies abroad will be monitoring developments across the EU and UK.  The senior officials group on Brexit readiness will meet throughout the period and will provide central oversight and co-ordination of these operations.<\/p> <p> The Government has done its homework and is as prepared as we can be.  However, even with all the work undertaken by Government, business and citizens will face major disruption.  That is being honest.  It is simply not possible to mitigate against every Brexit risk.  There is no silver bullet that solves all problems.  A number of the changes will be outside of our control.  We need to recognise this reality and do what we can to adapt and react when these changes occur.  Some changes will be obvious to consumers, for example, the increased cost of meeting the new requirements may lead to certain companies deciding to no longer service the Irish market.  While our shelves will not be empty, of course, it is possible some of our favourite brands may no longer be available.<\/p> <p> Additionally, there remains a lack or clarity in respect of elements of the UK's preparations, which impacts on our ability to finalise our own planning.  Even before Brexit, we were seeing delays in Dover and Calais.  We anticipate there will be delays and potential disruption in Irish ports as operators adjust to the new systems of checks.<\/p> <p> We have no intention of undertaking unnecessary checks or delaying goods for no reason.  Our approach at our ports has the twin aim of ensuring trade can flow to the greatest extent possible while maintaining food safety standards, public health and our obligations to the Single Market.<\/p> <p> We all understand the importance of the Single Market to Ireland's economy.  It is the mechanism by which our goods move freely without customs formalities and regulatory checks and why we have seamless access to a market of 450 million people.  In return for this access, we have an obligation to protect the integrity of the Single Market we belong to.  We will do everything possible to minimise delays but everyone has to play his or her part.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members and responding at the end of the statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700065#OOO00700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608232200,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his ongoing hugely positive role in this process, his leadership in the Department of Foreign Affairs and his excellence as a colleague.  I appreciate that and that extends across this House on Brexit.  There has always been a shared understanding across the Oireachtas of what the UK's decision to leave really means.  From the broad political consequences to the specifics of technical policy areas, the unity of purpose in both Houses has been a hallmark of Ireland's approach to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Make no mistake, our European colleagues have seen that the Irish have their act together on Brexit and, in return, have shown us tremendous solidarity.  While the Minister was speaking, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, issued a statement following her conversation with Boris Johnson and it is no different from what the Minister and I were discussing only an hour ago, that substantial progress has been made but big differences remain, particularly on fisheries.  The Commission President said that bridging them will be very challenging and that the negotiations will continue tomorrow, which we welcome.  It is important and in everybody's interest that a deal be achieved and work continue strongly.<\/p>  <p>  This unity in the Oireachtas to which I referred was evident last week as the Brexit omnibus Act passed through the Houses, with the exception of one provision, which did not directly relate to the issue of Brexit.  It was clear all sides supported the legislation.  President Higgins signed the Bill into law on 10 December and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, commenced Part 1 yesterday.  This paves the way for other sections to be commenced in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has followed every step of the negotiating process on the future relationship since the talks began nine months ago.  Deadlines have come and gone but there has never been any doubt that our negotiating team - and Michel Barnier is our negotiator - would strive with every fibre of their being for a positive outcome.  Michel Barnier is our good friend.  He has an incredible insight into Ireland going back a long time in his role as minister for agriculture in France and as a European Commissioner, with his special role on this island.  Thousands of hours of hard, patient work continue to be done by our negotiators.  The talks have never been about one side winning or losing or about gaining the upper hand, but about creating a new and stable framework for EU-UK co-operation to continue, even as the nature of our relationship changes.<\/p>  <p>  On 16 December, President von der Leyen, addressing the European Parliament, noted that while we have found a way forward on most issues, gaps remain on the level playing field and fisheries.  We see her up-to-date statement this evening.  They are vital issues, crucial to our country and without which agreement cannot be reached.  This House knows the Government's position is that there must be a workable outcome for fishers that does as much as possible to protect our coastal communities.<\/p>  <p>  We do not yet know whether there will be a deal.  I can assure the House there is no choreography.  This is reality.  It is hard and the gaps are difficult to bridge.  Progress has been made on issues, though, and talks continue.  There could be a narrow path to agreement, as the President of the Commission said.  Political will on both sides is necessary and the coming days are decisive.  We have been saying that for a long time but it is clearly the case with Christmas and 31 December approaching.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister said, even with a deal, the consequences for our country will be significant.  Pretty much every change we are preparing for and for which we have asked businesses to prepare - which most have - will transpire deal or no deal.<\/p>  <p>  Joint analysis by the Department of Finance and the ESRI indicates that over the medium term, Ireland's level of GDP is expected to be between 1.9% and 3.3% lower, compared to a situation where the UK remained in the EU.  That is a frightening statistic.  Underneath that, there are sectors and regions of this country, with agrifood, fisheries, manufacturing and retail the most exposed.  <\/p>  <p>  Supporting businesses to prepare for this change has been a priority of our Brexit preparations.  A sustained and intensive communications and stakeholder outreach programme remains central to this work.  Countrywide, people will have come across our Brexit ads on the radio - bh&iacute; an-&aacute;thas orm iad a fheice&aacute;il i nGaeilge freisin - on television, in newspapers and in social media feeds.  Since September alone, between myself, the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, we have discussed Brexit at more than 100 events, to say nothing of the countless engagements and seminars delivered by our officials, who I thank for their incredible work, and by the teams of officials across Departments who will be watching any deal that comes out over the days before and after Christmas, at much expense to their families, it must be said and acknowledged, but to the great benefit of our county.  This work will continue.  If there is a deal in place, we will continue to engage with business to explain the deal and get businesses ready that are not ready.  In a no-deal situation, even more work will be required.  <\/p>  <p>  Our Revenue Commissioners have written to more than 90,000 businesses that have traded with the UK since 2019 and followed up with direct phone contact with 14,000 businesses.  The T&aacute;naiste wrote to all 225,000 companies registered in Ireland with advice on preparing for the end of the transition period.  All Departments and agencies have advisory resources available.  In the absence of large gatherings, we have made great use of virtual platforms and webinars to connect with our stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Brexit omnibus Act provides for postponed accounting of VAT.  We introduced the ready for customs grant to help companies prepare for new customs requirements.  Up to &euro;9,000 is available per eligible employee placed in a customs role.  To date, more than &euro;5.4 million in funding has been provided.  In addition, more than 2,000 businesses have registered for the Clear Customs Online training programme, 1,070 approvals have been made under the local enterprise offices' technical assistance for micro exporters grant and InterTradeIreland has approved 2,495 Brexit planning vouchers.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has highlighted the detailed work that has taken place across all key sectors to get ready for 1 January.  I would like to focus on our deal and on no-deal preparations at ports and airports.  These are the vital gateways to our trade with the EU and the UK and we have invested significantly to make sure they are ready for the demands that will come with the end of the transition period.<br\/><br\/>The State has taken steps to ensure we can manage the introduction of the new checks and controls and keep trade flowing.  We have significantly expanded the State's facilities at Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Rosslare.  In Dublin Port alone, we have completed 140,000 sq. m of building works involving 500,000 person hours.  These facilities include new inspection bays, import and export facilities and more than 300 parking spaces for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs.  I have visited these facilities and tip my hat to our officials, who are working hard to get everything ready.  We have also greatly enhanced the capacity of customs and other ICT systems to manage the new processes, including the expected increase in annual import and export declarations from approximately 1.6 million per annum to in excess of 20 million per annum next year.  That is an extraordinary statistic.  Provision has been made to deploy some 1,500 staff to support and carry out the increased customs, sanitary and phytosanitary, and food safety checks and controls.  A comprehensive programme of testing is under way and involves key agencies and port users.  Testing at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort last year involved 38 HGVs across both locations.  We also recently published traffic management plans for Dublin Port and Dublin more widely.  These plans are publicly available and it is worth repeating that there is a wealth of information on <i>www.gov.ie\/brexit<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>While we have secured flexibilities at EU level for goods moving across the UK land bridge, I have highlighted many times how the route will become more complicated.  The increase in direct ferry services is welcome and we would welcome even more.  It is clear that a number of traders and operators are beginning to look at this option.  Indeed, some substantial traders have abandoned the land bridge.  I would urge anyone for whom a direct ferry is an option to trial it as soon as possible because we are coming to the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>We are all aware that the coming changes present challenges, but it is important to remember that we do not face them alone.  The European Commission has published details of the EU-level contingency measures that will come on stream if no agreement is reached.  While they are significantly less than the <i>status quo<\/i>, they will keep the planes flying and road freight flowing in the first half of next year.  As a consequence of Brexit, the Commission was required to introduce these contingency measures.  This was not an imaginary problem, but a real one that had to be solved.  I look forward to seeing more detail on the allocation under the EU's &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve, which is an important fund.<br\/><br\/>Deputies have consistently engaged on these important matters and I look forward to hearing their views.  I thank them most sincerely for continuing the tradition that obtained in the previous D&aacute;il of supporting the Government on Brexit, engaging with us, challenging or providing ideas when necessary, distributing information and encouraging our businesses and consumers to get ready.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700066#PPP00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608232800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>We are rapidly approaching the midnight hour that will mark the introduction of Brexit.  The closer we get to that moment, the more I am reminded of the work of the historian Professor Christopher Clark, who described the great powers of Europe in the fateful summer of 1914 as sleepwalking towards the edge of a cliff as the Continent obliviously inched towards the ensuing catastrophe.  In the present, we are witnessing the re-emergence of a toxic form of English nationalism, the emotional expression of which appears to have supplanted any form of sound political judgment.  The <i>Financial Times<\/i>recently expressed a concern that the Tories have no post-Brexit strategy.  They have lived with the prospect of Brexit for years with little or no thought of the consequences.  This comes as no surprise to us in Ireland.<\/p><p>If Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been successful in anything, it is the shading of the term &quot;national sovereignty&quot; with a pejorative hue.  Having seeded the Tory Party amid a cacophony of jingoism in what would have been the traditional Labour heartland by appealing to the worst excesses of English nationalism, the Tories and Mr. Johnson are not inclined to surrender this electoral support.  In Trump-like fashion, they will instead feed the worst, most xenophobic and most triumphalistic demands and expectations of that base.<\/p><p>The decision by Prime Minister Johnson that four naval vessels would be detailed to defend British fishing interests is an outrageous act of aggression, particularly in the midst of the ongoing negotiations.  It is a throwback to 19th century British gunboat diplomacy, but that day is long gone.  Thanks to our allies in Europe and America, Tory Britain is no longer able to impose that state of affairs on Ireland.  Even in the event of a failure to secure a deal on fishing now, we can be optimistic that the soon-to-be-established government of an independent Scotland would be much more amenable even before its re-entry to the EU.  Another reason to be wary is that this act of maritime aggression is a sleight of hand by Prime Minister Johnson that is designed to distract English nationalists from potential concessions that might have to be made in the ongoing negotiations.<\/p><p>As the <i>Financial Times<\/i>has expressed, there is a fear that the post-Brexit environment has the potential to turn very ugly very quickly.  The level of anti-European and, in particular, anti-French sentiment being expressed throughout public discourse on Brexit in England must be a matter of grave concern to all Europeans.  There exists a real fear that this could create flashpoints and even physical confrontations.  As much as, if not more than, most countries, Ireland is well aware of the cost that accrues from the failure of politics.  The European project is primarily about peaceful co-operation.  It cannot and must not be allowed to be undermined by the domestic political ambitions of a discredited leader who, unfettered, would drive his country into penury, undermine the international rule of law and sacrifice our peace process on the altar of his own desire for power.<\/p><p>Conflicting reports on the negotiations continue to oscillate between deal and no-deal scenarios.  This evening, Mr. Michael Gove stated that there was a less than 50:50 chance of a deal.  As a nation, we have placed our trust in the capacity of the EU negotiators to represent Ireland's interests in the continuing talks.  Along with fellow member states and the President-elect of the United States, these negotiators have been steadfast in their support for the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish protocol, forcing the British to back down and remove the offending elements from the UK Internal Market Bill.<\/p><p>While we have little, if any, control over the actions of the British Government and the impact of its apparent <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach to preparations for Brexit, I regret to report that the same approach appears to have seeped through to this side of the Irish Sea, as stated at an Oireachtas committee meeting yesterday.  It is the sole responsibility of the Irish Government to ensure this country is as prepared as possible for the challenges that Brexit will bring, deal or no deal.  Yesterday, the Oireachtas received a warning from the road haulage industry that the anticipated disruption and obstruction that would arise as a consequence of new customs and import controls at points of entry to Ireland in the aftermath of Brexit would have catastrophic consequences and the potential to bring the industry to a standstill.  Reports suggest that we are facing into a period of unprecedented disruption in the movement of goods.  The Government should prepare a contingency plan for State-supported shipping routes in order to provide routes that may not be commercially viable or provided by private shipping companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020121700067#QQQ00200","speaker":"1625"}]
