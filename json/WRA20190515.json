In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in the Action Plan and in Sl&aacute;intecare will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  Progress has already been made in implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan Waiting List and Access actions this year. <\/p>  <p>  In March, I published the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019. The plan includes a target to reduce the overall number of patients on the waiting list for hospital operations and procedures to 60,000 by year end.  It is worth recalling that the number of patients waiting was 86,000 in July 2017 and significant progress has been made over the past two years.<\/p>  <p>  The Access Plan sets out the activity levels for the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) who, following an increase in funding in Budget 2019 to &euro;75 million, will supply additionality to HSE activity in order to reduce waiting times experienced by patients for a hospital appointment, operation or procedure.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to unscheduled care, the Winter Plan 2018\/19 was designed to ensure that the Health system was well prepared, within existing financial and capacity requirements, to meet the increased demand for services over the Winter period. In Q1 2019 the overall number of patients attending Emergency Departments increased by 8%, admissions increased by 5%, however, trolleys reduced by 12%. The 8am trolley count, while still too high at just under 29,000 in Q1 2019, was the lowest level recorded in five years.  Work has commenced on preparations for Winter 2019\/20.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review published last year, highlighted the need for a major investment in additional capacity in both hospital and community.  Progress has also been on the increasing capacity and the average number of open inpatient beds has increased by 3% between 2017 and Q1 2019 to 10,969 and further investment is scheduled in 2019 and 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500058#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Screening Programmes","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500058#WRA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[20904\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500058#WRA04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will extend the newborn screening test pilot scheme for detecting metachromatic leukodystrophy and severe combined immunodeficiency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>All newborn babies (between 3 and 5 days old)  are offered newborn bloodspot screening (generally known as the &lsquo;heel prick&rsquo;) through their parents\/guardians for eight very rare conditions that are treatable if detected early in life. <\/p><p>These include: <\/p><p>-  cystic fibrosis<\/p><p>-  congenital hypothyroidism <\/p><p>-  phenylketonuria<\/p><p>-  classical galactosaemia<\/p><p>-  MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) <\/p><p>-homocystinuria <\/p><p>-maple syrup urine disease <\/p><p>-glutaric aciduria type 1 <\/p><p>The most recent expansion of the programme occurred on 3rd December 2018 when screening for Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MCADD) and Glutaric Aciduria Type 1 (GA1) commenced.<\/p><p>Metachromatic leukodystrophy and severe combined immunodeficiency are not currently screened for as part of this screening programme in Ireland.<\/p><p>However and as per recommendation 5, contained within the Scally Review (2018), a National Screening Committee will be established and become operational before the end of 2019.

The Health budget was increased by &euro;848 million on 2018, a substantial additional level of funding. The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the HSE, which considers both the funding requirements as submitted by the HSE and the fiscal position. These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with agencies across Government. All public bodies put forward spending proposals but all such bodies, including the HSE, are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il. <\/p><p>The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge internationally. Despite welcome increases over recent years, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and ageing populations are major challenges to health funding internationally.

In 2018, &euro;4.15m development funding was allocated to the NWIHP to progress the Strategy.  Funding of &euro;3.1m is being made available to the NWIHP in 2019 to continue services introduced in 2018, along with an additional &euro;1m funding to further progress the Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the investment in maternity services made since the launch of the Strategy, more women and their families are being offered midwifery led care, with many of our maternity hospitals and units now providing home-away-from-home suites and community-based midwifery services. Bereavement teams have been established in all maternity hospitals and units and are providing compassionate care to women and families, in line with the National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death.

The term respiratory disease includes lung cancer, COPD, asthma, pneumonia, influenza, TB, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnoea amongst others.<\/p>  <p>  Inevitably this wide range of acute and chronic respiratory conditions impacts significantly on Ireland&rsquo;s health care system. It is one of the major health challenges of the 21st century the EU 28. A number of policies and strategies are addressing this. <\/p>  <p>  Healthy Ireland is a government-led initiative aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of everyone living in Ireland. Greater public awareness of signs and symptoms of respiratory disease and the importance of presenting earlier to a primary care physician are crucial for improving quality of life and outcomes and reducing impact on health services. Prevention is a key element of tackling the burden of respiratory diseases and Healthy Ireland encompasses policies that address the many lifestyle changes that can reduce the risk of respiratory disease including smoking cessation, tackling obesity and promoting exercise. <\/p>  <p>  Most people with respiratory disease are cared for in the community by their GP and primary care team. The recent agreement on GP contractual reforms involving my Department, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO)  is an important step towards improving care for these patients. Over 400,000 Medical Card and GP Visit Card patients with chronic illnesses, including respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD will stand to benefit from new and improved chronic disease management programmes<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in tackling acute and chronic respiratory diseases through the HSE National Clinical Programmes including the development of models of care, adapting national guidelines, improving integrated care and supporting patient self-care.  A recent review of the HSE National Clinical Programmes completed by the Office of Chief Clinical Officer in the HSE has recommended the amalgamation of a number of respiratory disease clinical programmes under one Respiratory National Clinical Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Successive National Cancer Control Strategies over the last 20 years have supported health service providers to prevent cancer, treat cancer, and increase survival and quality of life for those who develop cancer, by converting the knowledge gained through research, surveillance and outcome evaluation into strategies and actions.

There are also eight rapid access lung cancer clinics located in each of the Cancer Centres in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The reform of our health services, as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare is the foundation upon which we will meet the challenges of management of the major chronic diseases including the burden of respiratory disease.

Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  <\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include:<\/p>  <p>  A.

A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.<\/p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base. However, the base for USC does not include payments made by the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, including the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in 2011 and the issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public service individuals who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.  In retirement therefore they receive an occupational pension only, and do not receive a separate State Pension unless as a result of PRSI contributions made in another employment during their working life.<\/p>  <p>  It was decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as an exemption would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it could involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefitting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.<\/p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, in Budget 2012 the entry threshold to USC was increased from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum, and the threshold was subsequently increased further in Budgets 2015 and 2016, to the current threshold of &euro;13,000.  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with public service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level. It is estimated that over 750,000 income earners will not be liable to USC in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In the last number of Budgets, the Government has been introducing targeted changes to the income tax system within available resources to make steady and sustainable progress in reducing the income tax burden, focusing on low and middle income earners.  This has been done by making targeted changes to the USC and also by increasing the entry point to the higher rate of income tax. <\/p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of income tax at too low a level and we are committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad.

In particular it is important to ensure that longer-term spending commitments are not entered into on the basis of a potentially short term upswing in corporate tax revenues.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published Revenue data in respect of Corporation Tax (CT) payments for the year 2018 show that the share of CT receipts from the top 10 companies increased to 45% in 2018.  However the report also notes that this increase was partially driven by a one-off change in accounting standards (IFRS 15) leading to additional tax receipts in 2018.  If these were excluded, the share of net receipts from the top 10 companies would have been 43%.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue data show that the proportion of receipts contributed by the top ten taxpayers in any given year has been relatively stable over time &ndash; for example it has ranged between 36% and 41% over the preceding five years 2013 to 2017.  Revenue data also indicates that there is a level of &lsquo;churn&rsquo; in the top-10 payers, i.e. the composition of the top 10 taxpayer companies changes from year to year.  As Ireland has been consistently successful in attracting leading multi-nationals to base here, and given our level of integration with the global economy, this concentration is not altogether surprising. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department has, together with Revenue, highlighted this as a risk in Budget and Stability Programme Update risk statements and in the Annual Taxation Report 2018. I am also aware of the risks associated with developing a reliance on potentially cyclical upturns in receipts, and the Government has taken a number of actions to address these risks, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Establishing the Rainy Day Fund;<\/p>  <p>  - Using the 2018 revenue over-performance to run an Exchequer surplus and prioritising the reduction of debt;<\/p>  <p>  - Continuing to broaden the tax base; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that receipts arising from identified one-off factors are not carried forward into the tax base for future years &ndash; for this reason &euro;0.7 billion  of the 2018 over-performance was not carried forward into the 2019 tax base on foot of the advice of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal for an assessment of the sustainability of corporation tax receipts, forecasts are inherently subjective and often rely on reference to long-term averages as a component factor.  In the case of corporation tax, this subjectivity would be further compounded by the ongoing process of international tax reform.  Implementation of the agreed BEPS Actions is under way and further work has commenced at the OECD to agree further changes at a global level that address the tax challenges that arise from the digitalisation of the economy.

Where appropriate, this work will make recommendations for changes to the tax forecast methodology.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the work already under way within my Department, and the other considerations referred to in this answer, I do not intend to establish a separate review of the nature suggested by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Lending","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[21018\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding enabling the credit unions to provide affordable mortgages, especially for young first-time buyers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>Credit Unions are already allowed to offer mortgages to their members and indeed a number of Credit Unions do. As of March 2019 there were &euro;175 million of mortgages outstanding across the sector.<\/p><p>The amount of mortgage lending Credit Unions can engage in, however, is limited by the Central Bank&rsquo;s lending regulations for Credit Unions which allow only a certain proportion of a Credit Union&rsquo;s loans to be long term loans due to lending maturity limits. <\/p><p>These lending regulations have been under review since October 2018 when the Central Bank commenced a public consultation.<\/p><p>Reviewing these Lending Regulations is a very important matter and one for which I have previously outlined my strong support &ndash; including in a letter I wrote to Governor Lane in late 2017.<\/p><p>The proposed revisions to the Lending Regulations from the Central Bank contain many positive elements. The proposals change the basis of calculation for the limits from a percentage of loans to a percentage of assets, which is something that the sector has been calling for. The proposals would also allow larger and capable credit unions to do significantly more mortgage lending than is currently the case.<\/p><p>Based on the data supplied in the Consultation Paper, the proposals would allow in the first instance a sectoral capacity of &euro;861 million for mortgages, which should be seen in the context of the &euro;175 million of mortgages outstanding across the sector as of March 2019.<\/p><p>This capacity would increase if applicable Credit Unions are approved for the higher limits.

The Deputy should note that there is no policy or legislative &lsquo;silver bullet&rsquo; to decrease the cost of insurance.  This was also recognised by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Reform, who reported on the issue in late 2016.  This is a complex issue because for constitutional reasons the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.<\/p>  <p>  Having said this, I wish to re-emphasise how important this issue is for the Government. Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase of the Group's work culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  Much work has been done to date through the implementation of both reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and achievements to date include:<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries;<\/p>  <p>  - the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has commenced its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;<\/p>  <p>  - increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank;<\/p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;<\/p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers;<\/p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, collections of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system; as well as the launch recently of Operation Coatee, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud; and,<\/p>  <p>  - the Courts Service has confirmed that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Redeployment","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[21030\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of clerical and executive officers, respectively, granted transfers under the Civil Service mobility and principal officer mobility schemes since it commenced in September 2018; the number still on the waiting list for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[21031\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of principal officer posts granted transfers under the Civil Service mobility and PO mobility schemes since it commenced in September 2018; the number still on the waiting list for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Civil Service Mobility scheme which comes under the remit of my department, and is administered through HR Shared Services, National Shared Services Office, offers an opportunity for staff members to apply for mobility through an open and transparent system.

Significant among these are changes made in 2017 to funding for Irish Water. Following the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017, all Motor Tax receipts are paid into the Exchequer, rather than the Local Government Fund, and all State funding for domestic water services is provided through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. This resulted in an increase in gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government of &euro;792 million.  This increase had no impact on overall General Government expenditure. Conversely, REV 2015 reflected the disestablishment of the HSE Vote with expenditure of the HSE now met by way of a grant from the Department of Health Vote.  As a consequence, certain income previously recognised as appropriations-in-aid on the HSE Vote is now retained by the HSE and is no longer reflected in gross expenditure ceilings or outturns from 2015 on. On the Defence Vote, from 2015 onwards, the purchase of military equipment was reclassified as capital expenditure rather than current expenditure. This accounts for the apparent rise in Defence capital expenditure that occurs between Budget 2015 and Budget 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[20970\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500062#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if prefabs will not be needed for a school (details supplied) and the structural defects amended before the start of the new school year in September 2019.","asker":"1302","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be will be aware that last October and November my Department carried out initial investigations into 42 schools where structural defects had been identified. 22 required precautionary measures to enable continued safe occupation.  <\/p>  <p>  Following on from the initial investigations, which were based on sample opening up works, my Department initiated a second phase of detailed investigations for the schools on the 18th of January last.

An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. <\/p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  <\/p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.<\/p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.<\/p><p>There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.<\/p><p>There are therefore more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. <\/p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500063#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Data","counter":269,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500063#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":270,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[20959\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500063#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cohort the July provision is aimed at;

It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.<\/p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) specifically called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation.

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society. The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.  <\/p><p>The inaugural Positive Ageing stakeholder forum took place in 2017. Stakeholders were asked to identify key priorities to propose to Government to consider for its focus in the coming year. Through this forum, clear channels of communication between the stakeholder representative group and relevant Government Departments to discuss these priorities have been facilitated by the Department of Health. The second annual stakeholder forum took place in the Department of Health in October 2018. Again, stakeholder identified clear priorities and collaborative work in this area is ongoing.<\/p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) was established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies. HaPAI provides an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on positive ageing and implement the research objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS).  It was jointly funded by the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme, and the Atlantic Philanthropies.<\/p><p>The initiative aims to monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the NPAS. This is done primarily through the development of national positive ageing indicators which will be published at suitable intervals. The indicators report will allow all Departments to identify areas of improvement in relation to older persons' health and well-being, as well as areas requiring improvement and potential for evidence-based policy intervention.  <\/p><p>Home support is an important part of the supports for enabling older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals. Improving access to home support is a priority for Government.  Over the past four years the Government has overseen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million this year. This year the HSE intend to provide over 18 million home support hours<b><\/b>to be delivered this year to over 53,000 people.  <\/p><p>The Department of Health is also currently engaged in the development of a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-support services. In preparation for the development of the statutory scheme, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to carry out a review of the home-care systems in four European countries. In addition, the Department conducted a public consultation on home-care services, on which a report was published in 2018. These reports are available on the Department&rsquo;s website and will help to ensure that the new scheme is informed both by international experience and by the views of stakeholders, including service-users.<\/p><p>Work is on-going to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. The Department&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of the statutory scheme in 2021. In 2019 work will focus on the design of the scheme, the options for regulation and a review of existing services. Further consultation will also be undertaken in 2019 (with key stakeholders and service-users) and will continue throughout the process of developing the new scheme.<\/p><p>The development of a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-support services is a complex process. Accordingly, it will be early 2020 before it is possible to set out in principle the parameters of the scheme and to seek Government approval to proceed to draft the heads of a bill. <\/p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is the policy responsibility of the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality. The 2015 Act provides for the establishment of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission to support decision-making by and for adults with capacity difficulties and to regulate individuals who are providing support to people with capacity difficulties.  A Steering Group chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality meets monthly to progress the establishment of the DSS.  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  <\/p><p>The Department of Health has policy responsibility for Part 8 of the 2015 Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives (AHDs). An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity. <\/p><p>Section 91 of the Act relates to the development of a code of practice to accompany the AHD provisions. On 17 October 2016 the Minister for Health established a multidisciplinary working group to prepare a detailed series of recommendations for the Director of the Decision Support Service (DSS), in relation to the code of practice under section 91(2) of the Act. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 in December 2018 [S.I. No. 527 of 2018]. This will enable the Director of the DSS to progress the preparation of the code of practice on the AHD provisions, based on the working group&rsquo;s recommendations, and in accordance with the specific process outlined in the Act. The multidisciplinary working group submitted its recommendations on the code of practice to the Director of the DSS on in December 2018. <\/p><p>Once completed the final code of practice can be published by the Director with the Minister's consent. The development of the code of practice to accompany the AHD provisions is a key piece of work in facilitating the subsequent commencement of Part 8 in its entirety. <\/p><p>Elder abuse (in a health sector context) is among the topics which will be covered in a new national policy on adult safeguarding in the health sector, currently being developed by the Department of Health following a Government decision in December 2017. It is intended that the policy will apply across the full spectrum of the Irish health and social care sector i.e. all public, voluntary and private health and social care services. A draft policy (which the Department aims to finalise around the end of 2019) will be the subject of a public consultation exercise. As the policy development process progresses, legislative requirements will also be identified. It is intended that following completion of the Adult Safeguarding policy for the health sector, any underpinning legislation required to give full effect to the policy will be pursued as appropriate. <\/p><p>Other recommendations included in the Report of the Assembly including those relating to taxation, retirement age and pensions do not fall within the remit of the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500067#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500067#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[18072\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500067#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to allocate additional resources to the health service in view of the recruitment difficulties across the sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>The 2019 National Service Plan set out a budget of over &euro;16 billion for the HSE, the highest budget ever allocated.

Preliminary data indicates that at the end of March there were 52,360 people in receipt of home support.  During the first quarter of the year 4.2 million hours were delivered nationally, 4,411 new clients commenced the service and 6,238 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional home support services.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like.

The Medical Council has no role in employing doctors. <\/p><p>When applying for registration a doctor must make a number of declarations, including whether or not they have been subject to disciplinary procedures such as Fitness to Practise or have a criminal conviction in another jurisdiction. The Medical Council is also part of the IMI (Internal Market Information)<b><\/b>system which means that when a practitioner is sanctioned (including erasure\/cancellation) in other EU jurisdictions the Medical Council will receive an alert. If a practitioner is the subject of a notice from an IMI alert is also on the Medical Council's register the Council may decide to take its own disciplinary action. If the Council has strong concerns about a practitioner the Council may use Section 60 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to apply to the High Court to seek an emergency suspension of a practitioner&rsquo;s registration in order to protect the public, pending the outcome of the disciplinary process as per the Act.<\/p><p>The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 provides a statutory basis for the vetting of persons carrying out &ldquo;relevant work with children or vulnerable persons&rdquo;.  <\/p><p>Garda vetting is an integral part of the HSE recruitment and selection process for positions which constitute &ldquo;relevant work&rdquo; and the onus is on the management of a service to determine if a vetting disclosure is required.<\/p><p>General practitioners are not employees of the HSE they are private contractors providing services under contract on behalf of the HSE.

The risk reduction measures recommended by the EMA on foot of its previous review in 2014 were fully implemented in Ireland; prior to this, there were no specific restrictions over and above those listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) leaflet for healthcare professionals and the patient information leaflet. As with any medicine, these documents were regularly updated as new data emerged about the medicine and its potential side effects. The study referred to by the Deputy suggests that the association between valproate use in pregnancy and congenital malformations in children was firmly established by 2005. The SmPC and patient leaflets used in 2005 reflect this association, and the patient leaflet includes specific information for women who become pregnant, or could become pregnant, while taking this medicine, based on the increased risk of having a child with an abnormality.<\/p>  <p>  An assessment conducted by the HSE estimates that between 153 and 341 children will have experienced a major congenital malformation and up to 1,250 children will have experienced some form of neurodevelopmental delay following exposure to sodium valproate in utero between 1975 and 2015. It should be noted that this assessment was subject to a number of assumptions and limitations, and relied heavily on international data when developing estimates of the numbers of children who may be affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500068#WRL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500068#WRL02700"},{"type":"question","counter":440,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[20974\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500068#WRL02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the healthcare assessment and needs of children suspected of having foetal valproate syndrome will be prioritised as a matter of urgency; and if there will be no delays in diagnosis and service provision","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":441,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  <\/p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; <\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board;<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service.<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.   <\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.   <\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned. <\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has just published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers. <\/p>  <p>  This is an important development which will be of invaluable help to those entering nursing homes, nursing home providers and relatives, particularly at a time that can be stressful and difficult for families. The guidelines developed by the CCPC are an important step in improving transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers, particularly in situations where the consumer may be at increased risk of vulnerability. The Guidelines also set out requirements in relation to transparency regarding additional charges and the variation of charges. <\/p>  <p>  It is noted that all providers will receive a formal communication from the CCPC shortly in relation to the new guidelines. The CCPC has stated that nursing homes will be afforded a period to review their contracts and ensure that they meet the requirements of the new guidelines. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500070#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Action Plans","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500070#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[21017\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500070#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to reduce eye care outpatient waiting lists and lengthy waits for cataract surgery nationally significantly in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:<\/p>  <p>  - detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments, 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes and 40,000 outpatient first appointments.<\/p>  <p>  - Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;<\/p>  <p>  - Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000 by year end.<\/p>  <p>  It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, including cataracts, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a key element of the 2019 Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List which remains a significant challenge. The Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments and the NTPF will deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of appointments approved relate to 4 high-volume specialties, including Ophthalmology. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheduled Care Access Plan is a key pillar of the project plan to deliver on the Ministerial and Department&rsquo;s 2019 Priority to improve Acute Hospital Waiting Times. The governance and oversight structures to oversee NTPF and HSE performance in the delivery against the targets set out in the Plan has been expanded to include a Working Group whose remit is to develop initiatives aimed at improving access for patients to scheduled care in a number of high volume specialties including Ophthalmology.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of July 2017, there were 10,024 people waiting for a cataract procedure.  Cataracts were one of the specialties targeted by the NTPF under the Inpatient Day Case Access Plan 2018 and by the end December 2018, the numbers waiting had fallen to 6,440, a reduction of 36%. There were 6151 patients waiting for a Cataract procedure at the end of April 2019, with 582 of those waiting over 9 months.

The plan will place a strong focus on a number of high-volume procedures, including angiograms and hip and knee replacements.

Of the total number of patients waiting, 76% (7,702) are waiting 9 months or less, equating to an 8.5% (-722) decrease when compared to the same period last year.

Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on the sector, given its unique exposure to the UK market, which accounted for 38% (&euro;5.2 billion) of agri-food exports last year.    <\/p>  <p>  There are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties which would face Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture food and fishery sectors. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.   <\/p>  <p>  I have held a number of discussions with Commissioner Hogan regarding the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector.  I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on agri-food and fisheries, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1308\/2013), as well increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.     <\/p>  <p>  Obviously, as Minister, I have no role when it comes to prices paid to producers but it is important to acknowledge that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a period of depressed prices since last autumn with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.  I also note that prices have started to increase week-on-week recently mainly due to tightening supply of cattle and the outlook is that this will continue.  Market intelligence also points towards other factors such as the presence of African Swine Fever in China affecting their pork output, thereby strengthening the demand for beef in a market to which Ireland already has access.   <\/p>  <p>  In light of the on-going market disturbance, I have, in discussions with Commissioner Hogan and my EU counterparts, said that I believe that the deployment of exceptional measures under the CMO Regulation, to provide targeted aid to farm families who have suffered a sustained reduction in returns from the market, is now required.  I made an intervention to this effect at the April meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and my officials have followed this up with a detailed submission, which is under consideration by Commission officials.   <\/p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to beef farmers under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.   <\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. Building on this is the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million pilot project for 2019.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  According to National Farm Survey already suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP, and through the next Agri Food strategy to 2030. My view is that such measures should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500075#WRS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[21129\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500075#WRS02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the requirements for the beef roundtable in view of the current crisis; the reason an organisation (details supplied) has not been included on the forum; when it will be included in the forum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1263","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":647,"content":"<p>The Beef Roundtable was most recently convened in October 2018 and the date for the next session will be announced in due course.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Within the budget available to the Department, grant funding is allocated on as fair and equitable basis as possible. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area of responsibility, with account taken where appropriate of the local authority's own resources in terms of rates and other income. It is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme taking available grant funding and its own resources into account.  In this context I continue to emphasise to local authorities the importance of prioritising roads when allocating their own resources. <\/p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the financial crisis there were major cutbacks in funding for the national, regional and local road network. This resulted in the severe curtailment in funding for road improvement grant programmes, including the Strategic Grant Scheme, in order to focus available funding on maintenance and renewal work.  <\/p>  <p>  The Building on Recovery Capital Plan 2016-2021 and the Capital Plan Review allocations mark a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes but it is going to take time for funding to build up to the required level.  For now funding will largely continue to support the maintenance of the regional and local road network. While a limited number of improvement projects are scheduled to go ahead over the next few years, funding is not available to commit to additional schemes at this point.  All available grant funding for 2019 has been allocated. <\/p>  <p>  The National Development Plan does note that local authorities have plans the progress a range of projects on regional and local roads and includes examples of such projects.  My Department will be liaising with local authorities in relation to possible future projects for development in the post 2021 period and the appraisal requirements in relation to such projects. <\/p>  <p>  While there were major cuts in grant funding for the road network during the recession, there have been significant increases in grants in recent years.  In this context Cork County has been allocated regional and local road grant funding of &euro;50,465,240 in 2019. To date my Department has not received an application for works at Lakeview roundabout.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the matter relates to a national road as well as a regional road, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design, budget management and construction of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the question to TII for a direct reply.

Following a review of the shared ownership scheme undertaken in 2013, my Department together with the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency and local authorities, considered the affordability issues facing some borrowers, who purchased properties under the shared ownership schemes and devised a more affordable long-term path towards full home ownership.  Indeed, a range of measures have already been undertaken to reduce the monthly payments of shared ownership borrowers.<\/p><p>The index linked shared ownership scheme, which operated from 1999 until 2002, has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term.  In addition, the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers was reduced to 2.3% with effect from 1 July 2016, which has helped many shared ownership borrowers.<\/p><p>An innovative shared ownership restructuring option has been available to shared ownership borrowers since 2016, and involves rolling-up all outstanding debt under a share ownership arrangement into a single annuity loan.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each shared ownership borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution, which is more easily understood.  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those shared ownership borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their rental equity balance.  The feasibility of this new option for each shared ownership  borrower will be determined by their local authority, and may not be appropriate in all cases.  For example, in some instances, continuing with the current shared ownership arrangement may be the best option for both the shared ownership borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution. <\/p><p>There is no obligation on any shared ownership borrower to restructure their loan arrangement and local authorities in implementing the restructuring option will direct shared ownership borrowers to seek financial and legal advice prior to accepting any offer of a restructuring option.  The new Abhaile Service, accessed via MABS, can assist shared ownership borrowers who are in arrears to access free independent expert financial and legal advice. Full details of the supports offered by the Abhaile Service are available from <i><\/i>. Under the restructuring option, where shared ownership borrowers require financial and legal advice outside of that provided via MABS, local authorities will arrange to pay the cost of these fees to a maximum of &euro;1,000, excluding VAT.  Detailed guidance, training and direction have been provided by my Department and the Housing Agency to local authorities regarding the implementation of the measure and my Department is continuing to monitor the impact of the new measure for borrowers. <\/p><p>Details on the measures available to borrowers with shared ownership arrangements are available from their local authority.  Overall, local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulties making the repayments on their shared ownership arrangement.  Information in relation to the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500078#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing for People with Disabilities Provision","counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500079#WRW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[21053\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500079#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the building of new accommodation at a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":746,"content":"<p>My Department issued Stage 3 pre-tender approval in November 2018 for a proposal under the Capital Assistance scheme to provide accommodation for persons with a disability adjacent to the school referred to.

The review has commenced and I expect to receive a report by the end of 2019.<\/p><p>The Terms of Reference for the review are available on the CRU website at the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500079#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":750,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500079#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":751,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[21115\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019051500079#WRW00775","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason he has not released funding to local authorities for the Rebuilding Ireland programme; when this funding will be released; if his attention has been drawn to the impact of the decision on local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":752,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan launched on 1 February 2018.

Archaeological assessments are a normal part of the pre-planning phases of new development proposals. The objective of such assessments is to verify that an appropriate approach is taken in relation to any archaeological material that may be present.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment in this case, comprising of a geophysical survey and archaeological test excavations, identified the presence of a subsurface archaeological enclosure in one area of the development site. In light of these findings, my Department subsequently approved a licensed excavation of the enclosure site in accordance with the provisions of the National Monuments Acts. <\/p>  <p>  The excavation licence provided for the archaeological excavation and recording of the archaeological enclosure. While my Department received an interim progress report during the course of the excavation work, a standard condition of all such licences requires a formal report to be submitted to both the Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service and the National Museum of Ireland setting out the results of the excavations and subsequent scientific analysis. The licensee is also required to publish a concise account of the excavation on the excavations.ie website. <\/p>  <p>  The National Monuments Service and the National Museum of Ireland will receive the preliminary report of the excavation findings in the coming weeks and a final report will be submitted in due course. I will be happy to share these reports with the Deputy when they are received in my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Acts, planning authorities also refer development proposals that may impact on archaeological heritage to my Department for comment so that recommendations may be made, as appropriate, to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.  My Department has recently responded to such a referral in relation in this case and has asked for further information to be obtained from the applicant with regard to the results of the archaeological assessment carried out to date and of such further assessment as may be appropriate in relation to the work to which the planning application relates.  The Department has also recommended that the applicant be asked to undertake an Ecological Impact Assessment and Bat Survey of the site. My Department will respond as appropriate on receipt of further information from the planning authority.<\/p>  <p>  Any submission made by a prescribed body to a planning authority may be taken into consideration by the authority when making its determination on a planning application.
