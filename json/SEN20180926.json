However, I am very disappointed that under measure 3, which makes specific provision for the funding of new rural group water schemes, we only got &euro;25,000.  I am also very disappointed that we are three quarters of the way through 2018 and Mayo County Council is only at this juncture being told what it can spend for 2018.<\/p> <p>Under measure 3 Mayo County Council was given &euro;25,000 for the Kilmurray group water scheme.  The scheme needs &euro;754,000 to get under way and be delivered.  This is a saga that goes back to 2010 when Ceantair Laga &Aacute;rd-Riachtanais, CL&Aacute;R, was abolished and people in Kilmurray had already done tremendous work in conjunction with the county council to bring forward a group water scheme.  They had gone to the tender process and had spent almost &euro;40,000 on consultants and to this day those people are out of pocket.  They have not been refunded their money.  They have been keeping a company going, paying fees to the Company Registration Office.  These people are all volunteers.  People in Downpatrick and Furmoyle are also waiting for water.<\/p> <p>We are talking about something that people living in towns and cities take for granted so much that they do not feel they should have to pay for it.  These people were more than willing to pay for their water.  I estimate that approximately 200 households in rural Mayo are affected.  There is also a problem in Galway.  There have been national monitoring committees and engagement with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to find a formula because people were told that under the formula applied, not enough money is given per household to deliver a scheme.  We were told to go back to the drawing board and find a new formula to fund rural water.  In 2016, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced a three-year multi-annual programme starting then and running to 2018.  Guess what?  These three areas are still waiting.  I acknowledge that Tonacrick, Killeen, Aghaloonteen and Massbrook have been dealt with.  There are a couple of handfuls of houses in these areas.  People are rightly cheesed off.  They are out of pocket.  They feel as though nobody has listened.<\/p> <p>There is no parity of esteem between people living in rural Ireland and those in the cities and the towns.  That is all I am asking for and I do not think it is reasonable or acceptable that three quarters of the way through the year, they are getting &euro;25,000 for Kilmurray alone when &euro;1.5 million is required.  What will Kilmurray do with that funding?  How can a council spend &euro;25,000 at this time of year?  It is ridiculous.  Will the Minister of State go back to the officials in the Department and ask them to take the provision of new groups water schemes seriously?<\/p> <p>I am not talking about clapped out water schemes that need to be upgraded.  Elderly people and young families living in rural areas are drilling wells.  They cannot drink the water or wash their clothes in it.  Nobody would like to live like that yet that is how this group is living.  There have been massive protests against water charges and there are people who did not engage in those who are prepared to pay for water.  I am a public representative in the Government party and I do not think this is acceptable for 200 households in Mayo.  Will somebody listen?  Will the Minister of State listen today?  Can some good news be given to these people? We are at the end of the three-year, multi-annual programme that the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, announced and where are we for these three groups?  We are nowhere.  This is not a countrywide problem but it is a problem that affects people in rural Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State to please take it seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#A00400","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Michelle Mulherin for raising this matter, which she has raised many times in recent years with me, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Department.  She has constantly pushed to have money spent on water and sewerage schemes in County Mayo.  This is very important work and I hope last week's announcements and further announcements in the weeks ahead will deliver the funding needed to realise these schemes.  I know from speaking to the Senator and many others that the provision of water services for the people of County Mayo, particularly those in rural areas, is an issue of keen interest.  I assure the Senator and the House that the Government shares this strong interest.  The Minister strongly believes in finding the appropriate resources for rural water schemes.  We want to ensure that the people of rural Ireland are supported in accessing good quality water and wastewater services.  This applies to the people of Mayo and every other county.  The Government will continue to back up its intentions in this area with funding.<\/p> <p>Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending the annual rural water services conference organised by the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, which took place in Claremorris in Senator Mulherin&rsquo;s home county.  I announced details of the funding being provided by the Government in 2018 under the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual rural water programme.  We have provided &euro;20 million for 2018, which is an increase of &euro;4 million from the &euro;16 million committed in 2017.  Last Friday, the Minister announced details of the allocations to individual local authorities and group water schemes for 2018.  The multi-annual rural water programme, which runs for the period from 2016 to 2018, consists of six different measures, including funding of new group water schemes under what is known as measure 3.  While funding is provided through my Department, the administration and implementation of the rural water programme is the responsibility of local authorities, which work in partnership with group water schemes, and do a great job in that regard.  I complimented that partnership over recent years when I spoke at the recent conference.<\/p> <p>Progress has been sought on the proposed Downpatrick, Kilmurray and Furmoyle group water schemes for many years.  I have no doubt there is a long history with the schemes.  In 2018, the Kilmurray group water scheme received an allocation of &euro;25,000 under the rural water programme.  This was among the allocations announced last week.  It will enable the scheme to commence necessary planning and proceed to construction in due course.  As the scheme is now approved in the current programme cycle, which ends this year, it should carry forward to the next programme cycle, which is to run from 2019 to 2021.  I stress that the Kilmurray scheme has been approved and is now in the system.  Funding is available to undertake the necessary construction works that will follow.  It is now a matter for the scheme to proceed as quickly as possible.  I have no doubt Senator Mulherin will make sure this happens and will drive it on.  Funding of &euro;95 million will be available for the next three-year cycle of the scheme.  This is a major increase which has been provided under Project 2040.  It has been secured to drive success and improvement under the rural water scheme.<\/p> <p>With regard to the Downpatrick group water scheme, in January 2016 Mayo County Council included a bid for the scheme.  This was also submitted under measure 3 of the programme, which deals with new group water schemes.  The proposal was ruled out at the time because it involved connecting a new scheme to the public water network operated by Irish Water.  Such works are not within the scope of the programme as it currently stands.  A further factor was the unit cost of some &euro;18,750 per house, which was considered very expensive.  Subsequent to the 2016 approvals, my Department engaged with Mayo County Council to see if an alternative at reduced cost could be found.  However, no satisfactory alternative has been established to a supply off the public mains for the proposed scheme.<\/p> <p>The multi-annual rural water programme is being reviewed.  Having regard to the outcome of the review and decisions to be taken on measures to be included in the programme from 2019 to 2021, applications will be invited from local authorities in respect of funding for that period.  These applications are to be sought later this year and there may be scope, in that context, for a further application to be made in respect of the Downpatrick group water scheme.  The Minister ordered the review in April last and it is due to report to him in the next month.  It will examine how best to ensure the money is spent in the years ahead to get results.  It may make some new suggestions and provide an answer on how to address the issue with the Downpatrick group water scheme.<\/p> <p>The Furmoyle group water scheme was also included in the 2016 bids by Mayo County Council for the multi-annual programme at a unit cost of some &euro;22,000 per house.  The expert panel assembled by the Department to review the bids concluded that the cost of the proposed scheme was too expensive and did not recommend it for funding.  Accordingly, the scheme was not included in the current programme.<\/p> <p>I hope this clarifies matters in respect of the group water schemes identified in County Mayo.  I assure Senator Michelle Mulherin that the Government and the Department are committed to funding water services in rural areas.  There are grant schemes in place for local authorities to make applications for funding for group water schemes.  There are also fair processes in place to assess these applications.  As I stated, the review will be submitted to the Minister in the next month.<\/p> <p>There have been significant increases in funding for rural water services.  The Government is committed to these services and has increased to &euro;95 million the allocation for the next round of the programme, which will run from 2019 to 2021.  I again thank Senator Mulherin for raising this issue, which she has pursued many times with the Department in the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#B00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister of State's considerable engagement and work on many rural issues, including water and pyrite.  I welcome his statement with regard to the Kilmurray group water scheme.  Given that the three-year multi-annual programme for 2019 to 2021 has been given the green light, I assume the scheme will be funded, which would be welcome.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State said he is committed to funding water services in rural areas.  People have been drilling wells in the Downpatrick and Furmoyle areas.  They cannot supply water through their own efforts.  It is not enough to say providing water is too expensive.  Are these people not entitled to water?  What will be done?  I understand there is a possibility the council may revise its proposal for a water scheme in Downpatrick.  It should be borne in mind that much of the expense arises from the type of terrain through which pipework has to be laid.  It would have to go through special areas of conservation and rocky areas.  The Minister of State knows about dispersed populations.  Many people in these areas have drilled wells which are no good.  Something has to be done.<\/p> <p>This request to the Government is the last recourse for people in Downpatrick Head and Furmoyle.  They have tried everything else.  Can they be helped?  Perhaps the Minister of State is not aware that Downpatrick Head is one of the signature points on the Wild Atlantic Way.  The areas does not even a public toilet because it has no running water, public mains supply or any sort of group water mains supply.  That is definitely not something of which we should be proud in this day and age.  One cluster of houses in the area has water.  Accepting what the Minister of State said, I ask that this matter be revisited.  We know that the unit cost of providing a mains water supply will be high.  This is the problem the people of the area have been facing all along.  Telling them that again does not help matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#B00200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will raise the Senator's point with the expert group and ask that it focus on the terrain issue.  Mayo County Council, in its application under the next round of funding, should make set out in detail the reasons the scheme is so important.  I am sure it did so in its previous application, but it may need to add to that and provide more evidence.  The expert group will make recommendations on behalf of the Department.  There is competition for resources in every county.  Schemes that are needed, represent good value for taxpayers' money and meet all the criteria will receive approval.  It is very important that a book of evidence accompanies the application.<\/p> <p>The Senator made a very good point on the benefits of the Wild Atlantic Way and the importance of it being well serviced with proper infrastructure in respect of toilet facilities and so on.  The local authority can add that to the case it makes.  We have all seen the success of the Wild Atlantic Way and the numbers of tourists it brings to many counties.  I have visited County Mayo frequently and the Wild Atlantic Way is clearly of great benefit to the local population and tourists.  We should try to support it.  A cross-Department approach could aid with costs and may be something we should pursue.  The local authority can gather the evidence and make a case for extra planning.  We can look at all the options.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned the work being done on pyrite and mica.  While I had an opportunity to meet residents in Donegal in July, I have not had a chance to meet residents in Mayo again.  The work being done by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, in respect of standard protocol and procedures is now nearly complete.  I made it very clear that as soon as its work is complete, we will be in a position to judge how to proceed.  I also made clear to residents in Donegal that once the work in the Department on the legalities involved and other matters has been done, we will be in a strong position to move on.

When I submitted this Commencement matter, may I point out that I used the following wording: \"The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to fast-track the essential building works at St. Molaga's senior national school, Balbriggan, County Dublin.\"  Unfortunately I have been in this Chamber on a number of occasions and raised the issue of St. Molaga's with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I am very sorry and frustrated to be here again today with the Minister of State and her officials to discuss the dire situation in St. Molaga's senior national school.<\/p> <p>St. Molaga's senior national school based in the town of Balbriggan, County Dublin, has 467 students, 28 teachers and six special needs assistants.  For the past 18 years, the expanding school population has been housed in prefabs.  Some 58% of the students in the school are housed in prefabs that are 18 years old and these prefabs are crumbling and are completely unfit for purpose.  There are holes in these leaking prefabs which are damp and completely unacceptable.  They have gone past their use by date.  The state of disrepair is down to the age of the prefabs.  The school itself has done its best to preserve the buildings so that the students could be housed for additional years.  The prefabs are completely overcrowded, freezing cold in the winter and really hot in the summer time.  The situation has become extremely urgent.<\/p> <p>Last week during Storm Ali, four prefabs were evacuated and the children and their teachers had to take up residence in the corridors of the main building and in the school hall.  The lids of two of the prefab water tanks were blown off and the school had to go into shutdown, meaning that more than half of the school could not access the main school building because they are in prefabs in another part of the site.<\/p> <p>These old, damp, crumbling prefabs are posing a serious risk to the students and staff who operate out of them.  As I said, more than half of the school population are housed in the prefabs.  The students and teachers are constantly sick, they are getting chest infections, and students who suffer from asthma have been detrimentally affected by this situation.

The technical report is still awaited.  We are now into another academic school year with predicted extreme weather conditions for the rest of the winter.  I am very afraid, as is the principal, that the situation will get even worse.

We also outlined how nine children did not have seats on the bus to Gleneely national school, which is in the north Inishowen area of Donegal.  The Minister of State agreed to consider both issues.  It is to be hoped he will make an intervention and recommendation.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has made it clear to public representatives in Donegal that it cannot provide more buses under the Department's rules.  The Minister of State is to make a decision on the issue.<\/p> <p>Since our meeting, though, we have discovered that there is another serious issue in Burnfoot, Bridgend, Tooban and Muff in south Inishowen, which feed into the three secondary schools in Buncrana.  Thirty pupils in that area do not have seats on their school buses.  All but two of them are eligible for school transport under the Department's rules.<\/p> <p>There was a public meeting in Muff last Monday evening.  The parents who attended outlined a range of reasons for tickets not being secured.  Clearly, there has been miscommunication and there have been misunderstandings.  Similarly, there was a public meeting in Termon on Monday evening regarding the Milford schools.  Again, parents reported issues.<\/p> <p>There needs to be some flexibility.  In south Inishowen, approximately 30 pupils are affected.  In the Milford area, approximately 30 pupils are affected.  In Gleneely in north Inishowen, nine pupils are affected.  That is a large number of pupils and parents who have been disadvantaged.  We talk about keeping people in rural communities, yet we are not giving them the supports they need in terms of school transport.  Most of these are working families with fixed hours, so they must make arrangements.  This is a major problem for them.<\/p> <p>Something has gone wrong this year.  Advance preparation has been an issue.  Surely a sense of the numbers requiring school transport at post-primary level can be achieved by contacting the primary schools that feed into those secondary schools.  Preparing properly and knowing the number of buses is not a major task with the understanding that, sometimes, communications can go wrong and deadlines can be missed.  We cannot leave people standing on the side of the road and without the proper transport.<\/p> <p>I emailed the Minister of State's ministerial colleague, Deputy Halligan, last night about the issue in south Inishowen.  He has all of the facts regarding Gleneely and Milford and he will have all of the details regarding south Inishowen.  He needs to make an intervention.  We cannot leave that number of pupils and parents behind.  It would be unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#D01300","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  I thank the Senator for raising it.<\/p> <p>Before I address the specific issues raised, I wish to give Senators an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  In the 2017-18 school year, more than 117,000 children, including more than 12,000 with special educational needs, were transported daily in approximately 4,500 vehicles to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering more than 100 million kilometres annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million.  Parental contributions towards the cost of school transport were &euro;15.4 million in 2017, with the remainder paid for by the State.<\/p> <p>Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.  Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the current school year where such services are in operation.  Children who are eligible for school transport but for whom no transport service is available may, following an application for transport within the prescribed time limits, receive a remote area grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.<\/p> <p>Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated.  This is referred to as concessionary transport.  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process.  Under the terms of the scheme, the number of spare seats varies from year to year based on the capacity of the buses running on all of the various routes and the number of eligible children accommodated on each route.  Hence, there is no guarantee that an ineligible child who received a place in a previous year will receive a seat the following year.  Neither is there a guarantee that a sibling of an ineligible child who receives a ticket will receive a seat.  It is included in the terms and conditions on the Bus &Eacute;ireann online application that availability of seats may vary from year to year and that concessionary transport cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child's education.<\/p> <p>Under the terms of the scheme, routes will not be extended or altered and additional vehicles will not be introduced.  Neither will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children who are not eligible, as no additional State cost will be incurred in covering the cost of providing school transport for children who are not eligible.<\/p> <p>More than 74,000 children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application process on time have been issued with tickets for school transport services for the 2018-19 school year.  A further 1,100 children who are eligible for school transport but were late in submitting their payment details were unsuccessful in obtaining seats on school transport services, as buses are operating to capacity.  In addition, more than 27,500 children who are not eligible for school transport and who paid by the deadline date have been issued with concessionary tickets for school transport.  Some 350 children who are not eligible for school transport and who paid by the deadline date were unsuccessful in obtaining concessionary seats on school transport services for the 2018-19 year, as buses are operating to capacity.<\/p> <p>The situation referred to by the Senator relates to a number of children whose payments were not received on time and a further number who are not eligible for school transport.  As the services in the area are operating at capacity, it will not be possible to accommodate them on school transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#D01400","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>That response was completely unacceptable to me and every other public representative in Donegal.  The 30 pupils in south Inishowen whose families are from rural areas and go to Buncrana secondary schools do not have seats on buses.

It is unfair.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State said \"a further number\".  All but two of the 30 are eligible for school transport.  Under the Department's rules, they are entitled to school transport.

We cannot leave those families behind.  Nine schoolchildren in Gleneely do not have school transport.  That response is unacceptable and it is not in keeping with what the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, said to us last Wednesday.  The Oireachtas Members who were present last Wednesday left hopeful that there might be a solution and that there could be an intervention because of the number of eligible students.  The distinction between \"eligible\" and \"concessionary\" is a matter for debate because a family in a rural area may live approximately 100 m closer to a school in another town than to the school the family has traditionally gone to.  For example, in this case the families have gone to the schools in Milford but they live 100 m closer to a school in Letterkenny and are being punished for that.  That is the issue of \"eligible\" versus \"concessionary\".  Going by the Minister of State's own rules, we have approximately 50 pupils who are eligible for school transport who are being left behind.  That is unacceptable to me and to any other public representatives in Donegal who are worth their salt.  I appreciate that officials from the Department of Education and Skills wrote the response the Minister of State is delivering today.  I ask her to speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and to ask him to honour the understanding we had last Wednesday.

Yesterday, we had the UN human development index showing that Ireland had jumped from eighth in the world to fourth in terms of health, education and income, which is to be welcomed in terms of life expectancy, educational attainment, health and people's wages.  We also see on the reverse end of that scale, however, homelessness and housing as an ongoing issue.  The Government is blaming others rather than itself, and it does not seem to have a plan, or rather it has many plans, because we have seen how many times it has announced them, but it does not have plans that it implements.  No one is being held to account for that, although the blame seems to be transferred from the Department down to the local authorities.<\/p> <p>We would like to see the real plan and the real figures.  The Department continually issues figures but these have been challenged in the media by Dr. Lorcan Sirr and others who show the Government portraying houses being built when often they are just being reconnected to the electricity system having had their electricity turned off.  The Department knows this and knows it is giving false figures but we cannot even get it to admit the truth until it is found out by experts.<\/p> <p>I would also like to raise the issue of the human tissue Bill, which the Minister for Health has announced again some 13 years after it was first announced.  In particular, I want to raise the issue of presumed consent, the idea that every one of us is an organ donor unless we opt out, and that there will be a very expensive system whereby we would opt out if we did not want to be organ donors.  This has not worked effectively anywhere else in the world.  Mark Murphy, CEO of the Irish Kidney Association, who is an expert in this area, has said time and again that despite the idea of presumed consent, with a register and so on, the family would still be consulted as to whether their loved one would be an organ donor.  This means it is not really presumed consent and it is talked of as a soft opt-out.  This is all done to distract from the fact the health system is not working properly and that we have so many people on trolleys.  I suppose it might provide a brief respite for the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#G00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Come off it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#G00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>We have a driving licence system through which we collect the information as to who wants to be an organ donor.

Despite this, he does not allow the health service to access the information that is in the driving licence registry of who does and does not want to be an organ donor.  It is a simple systems failure, like our organ donation system itself, where we spend hundreds of millions every year on dialysis.<\/p> <p>If we had proper systems whereby health professionals were able to contact the driving licence authority and then tell people that their son or daughter wanted to be an organ donor and that they have a copy of the driving licence, they would be able to inform families of their loved one's intentions.

That is one side of the problem.  The other side is that we have thousands of people who cannot afford either to purchase or rent a home.

I pay tribute to Tom Molloy.  He was part of a family group called the Molloy Brothers and they are traditional Irish musicians from Mulranny in County Mayo.  Tom and his brothers are renowned for their music and have performed in many venues across Ireland, England and throughout the world.  They played a piece of music called the \"Leaving of Liverpool\" for John Lennon when he visited County Mayo in 1969.  It is timely that this weekend the town of Ballina in County Mayo is hosting the music sessions and arts festival called the Other Voices.  The festival is a prestigious event in the music calendar and I wish everyone in Ballina well for the weekend.<\/p> <p>It was pioneers such as Tom who helped to place Irish traditional music at the centre of the folk revival.  Tom and his brothers helped to showcase Irish music across the world.  I extend my sincere condolences to his wife, Geraldine, his sons, Enda and Thomas, and his daughter, Elizabeth.  What the Molloy Brothers did for County Mayo and the music industry as a whole will never be forgotten.  It was not only just that.  They were so kind and always agreed to do charitable events.  I know even from my time in England it was always a pleasure to meet the Molloy Brothers and Tom Molloy.  They did what did with joy in their hearts and showed kindness wherever they went.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight a programme called \"Finn&eacute;\" that will be broadcast on TG4 tonight.  The programme is on the death of another Mayo man, the Mayo hunger striker, Frank Stagg.  His brother, George, recounts Frank's last days and how his body was hijacked by the Irish Government.  I am sure Senators will remember that he thought the body was being flown into Dublin Airport but the plane was diverted to Shannon Airport and Frank's body was taken away from his family.  The programme tells the personal story behind the event.  I commend Pat Kenny on the way he interviewed George Stagg about the story for Newstalk yesterday morning.  The story of what happened to Frank needs to be told and put in context.<\/p> <p>I will quote what George said when Pat Kenny asked him whether it was worth it and whether he would do it again.  George described how his brother, Frank, had been influenced by the Ballymurphy massacre in Belfast, internment and what had happened in the North.  George said that just because Frank was from Mayo did not mean that he was any less affected by what happened in the North and he saw the need to fight back because of injustices, such as the injustice in Ballymurphy.

He potentially faces 20 years in prison.  Sean denies all of the charges made against him.  He is being held in a Greek prison where his family and friends are deeply concerned for his safety.  He can be held for up to 18 months without being charged or sent to trial.  His mother has launched a public campaign and called on the Irish State to exert pressure and influence to guarantee her son's safety.  I hope that all of Members will support her call.  Sean is a young man who lived all his life in Ireland.  He graduated from university in Dublin.  Following the conclusion of his studies he decided to travel to Greece and dedicate his time and energy to literally pulling refugees from the Mediterranean Sea.

The last intake of students for the pharmaceutical assistant course was back in 1985.  There are about 300 pharmaceutical assistants, of which 95% are women, and they are employed in pharmacies throughout the country.  In the temporary absence of a pharmacist they are entitled to provide cover in the pharmacy for maybe two and a half days at a time or at lunchtime when the pharmacist takes his or her lunch break.  The current proposals made by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland are before the Minister and allow the pharmaceutical assistants to provide cover for up to one hour per day.  At present, if the pharmacist goes out sick, the pharmaceutical assistant can provide cover for the entire day.  The legislation was last amended in 1994.  If the current proposals are accepted, pharmaceutical assistants will not be able provide cover.  It is possible, therefore, that a pharmacy will have to close because such assistants can only provide cover for up to one hour per day.<\/p> <p>Many of these women have more than 30 years' experience.  The last of that cohort of assistants are now in their late 50s, so it is not like there are many of them waiting to come through the system to reach retirement age.  Pharmaceutical assistants are not covered by the fitness to practise legislation.  They are also not covered to continue their education, yet they choose to attend further education courses that are run for both pharmacists and pharmaceutical assistants.  Many of the latter participate on these courses of their own volition.<\/p> <p>The pharmaceutical assistants are not members of the Irish Pharmacy Union but the union supports them in their plight.  The union has written to the Minister urging him to work in a more cohesive manner on the following: to recommend to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland that it reconsider its stance and develop a core competency framework for pharmaceutical assistants similar to the one that applies to pharmacists; to bring the assistants under the fitness to work banner; and to make it compulsory for pharmaceutical assistants to attend the continuing education courses.  Such actions would provide the necessary assurance to the PSI council and to the public of the competence, knowledge and skills of pharmaceutical assistants.  Also, pharmaceutical assistants would be able to continue to act safely in the temporary absence of a pharmacist under the current conditions.<\/p> <p>This matter is very important because we all visit pharmacies at least weekly and we never know whether we are dealing with the pharmacist or the pharmaceutical assistant.  That many of these pharmaceutical assistants have in excess of 30 years' experience must stand for something.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maria Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Leader might be able to bring that issue to the attention of the Minister because it affects every city and county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#H00700","speaker":"1384","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I refer to the 2018 report of the European Parliament Constituency Committee.

The committee, with respect, should have taken that into account but it is obvious it did not because it did not increase the number from four to five.  It increased the number for Dublin from three to four and the number for the South from four to five.  It is a long way from Belfast to Cork.  It is not a long way from Belfast to Dundalk.  When the legislation is drawn up the Government should take that situation into consideration.  The people of Northern Ireland are entitled to representation in the European Union after the United Kingdom leaves, even though Northern Ireland voted to remain.<\/p> <p>An interesting point about this is that the two members taking their seats in the new European Parliament after May 2019 will be subject to the withdrawal, legally, of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  Technically, therefore, the 11 seats will stand until the United Kingdom legally leaves the European Union, which may not actually be for five years; we do not know.

They should be available to meet them throughout the length and breadth of Northern Ireland.  That is a commitment any candidate should make, and I put it up to the candidates now.

These people study for three years for their undergraduate degrees, and most of them pay approximately &euro;10,000 to do their masters degrees.  They then become assistant psychologists but they do not get paid work.  To get paid work, they have to study for clinical doctorates but in to gain admission to the relevant course, they have to have experience.  These young people are then forced to work for nothing.  I know a young lady who works five days a week in a local business for the minimum wage and then works two days a week, free of charge, as an assistant psychologist.  This lady is working seven days a week for the minimum wage.  Most of those jobs are in Dublin so she is travelling from the country to Dublin for two days a week, putting petrol in her car and having to stay overnight, to work for the minimum wage.  That is not good enough.  She uses the few bob she earns from the local business to fund her working.  I strongly believe that there is not a trainee psychiatrist in this country who is asked to do that.  It is not fair or equal that a psychologist would have to do it.

The Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, are meeting today to discuss the findings of Public Service Pay Commission and figure out how we can correct the problem of more than 2,000 vacancies throughout the nursing profession.  The Public Service Pay Commission has stated that there is no issue with nursing recruitment, but that is inaccurate and misleading.  The dogs in the street know it is an issue.  The staff and the patients know it is an issue.  To take psychiatry alone, mental health is spoken about a great deal.  The latest audit of nursing vacancies indicates that the number of unfilled nursing posts in mental growth is growing, and there are 700 posts vacant in that speciality alone.  That is nearly 200 vacancies since last year when the last audit was done.  There are 88 vacancies in St. Ita's Hospital and 76 vacancies in St. James's Hospital.  In Dublin north city, there are 56 vacancies, 62 in Galway, 46 in Louth-Meath and so on.<\/p> <p>The Public Service Pay Commission has ignored the scale of the mounting recruitment and retention crisis facing our entire health services.  Retirements projected over the next five years will put further pressure on an already broken system.  The conclusion of the pay commission that there is no issue with nurse recruitment is completely at odds with the evidence and experience of nurses and patients across the services.  The reality is that there are ongoing vacancies, in some places as high as 25%, which are impacting daily on the delivery of health services.  In particular, the staff shortages in child and adolescent mental health services are well documented, as is the excessive and expensive reliance on overtime and agency nurses throughout our services.  Nurses argue that these staff shortages are unsustainable and can be best addressed by a pay rise across the grade.  Will the Leader ask for a debate with the Minister about the Public Service Pay Commission and the reason it rejected across the board pay rises in services that are much needed for the health of our nation?  It has ignored the mounting recruitment and retention issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#J00600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I congratulate the communities throughout the country that were involved in the Tidy Towns competition.

I raised it last week, am raising it this week and will probably raise it again next week or until there is some action.<\/p><p>The Minister in charge of the school transport service must come to the Chamber to go over the policy issues which are impinging significantly on people going to school.  It is almost impossible for a person to get a bus, in particular in my part of the world, where he or she is just outside the area.  There is no leniency and discretionary tickets are fading away because of population increases, in particular in the larger towns and villages close to schools.  That means there is a knock-on effect on children in rural areas who cannot access a school bus service.<\/p><p>I have listened to the debates on this for the last 18 months and have continuously heard that it is a policy issue.  As such, the Minister must come to the Chamber.  We need a real debate on the vision.  What does he propose to do for the education service to ensure that students can get school transport?  The system is currently ineffective because it discriminates down to the square mile or even in terms of a matter of a hundred yards, as in some cases I have encountered in recent weeks.  In fairness to Bus &Eacute;ireann and other providers, they are only following the letter of the law.  There must be a total change in the 314 districts in place now and the way we ensure bus services get pupils to schools.<\/p><p>There is a degree of discrimination involved here.  If one is far away, one is excluded and told one is in the catchment of another school.  That does not always work depending on the parish one lives in or the local demographics.  If one has a parish which is aligned with a secondary school in the nearest town, pupils always go there.  As such, a bus service should be provided.  The whole system needs a real overview.  We need to schedule time and to bring the Minister to the House.  It is not about budget issues; it is about a change in policy and a complete review.  What I really need is for the Leader to see if we can get the Minister to come to the House so that we can have a complete review of the policy.

Sometimes catchment areas do not overlap correctly with the result that children are refused access to schools.  It is a real and urgent matter that we must deal with.  We will have to see the Minister work with the Department of Education and Skills to bring forward a solution.  I welcome the fact that Senator Lombard has raised the issue today.  It is one we need to address quickly.  Certainly, he will have my full support on that.<\/p> <p>As to the upcoming budget, I note that I am privileged to work with an all-party group on dementia.  We have put forward budget proposals detailing approximately &euro;50 million of investment in community supports for people with dementia.  While it will be difficult for the Leader to have the Minister attend prior to the budget, I still wish to raise the matter.  If the Leader has an opportunity to raise the matter with the Minister, I would appreciate it if he does so.  I will give the example of two areas where a small amount of money could make a huge difference.  Within our submission, we ask for &euro;1.4 million for dementia advisors to work with families and GPs across the country.  That alone would help people to stay within their communities and raise the level of awareness among GPs and families of the available supports.  While supports exists, sometimes people find it difficult to access them due to lack of knowledge.  Dementia advisors would help in that regard.  We have also asked for &euro;3.1 million to provide centres of excellence to support GPs and families.  These centres of excellence would be located in primary care centres and could cross over with supports for Down's syndrome also.<\/p> <p>If we could get the Minister to come to the House it would be, above all, to discuss home-care packages.  We have requested &euro;6 million to provide home-care packages for people with dementia.  This is the second budget where there is a bit of wriggle room.  This is a growing problem nationally.  If we could start this year to provide an additional &euro;6 million towards home-care packages for people with dementia, it would have a real impact for people suffering from this, assist their families and allow people to continue to lead productive lives within their communities.  I know time is tight and I will fully understand if the Leader cannot get the Minister to attend within the period.

In particular, I highlight the use of those numbers by public bodies and public services.  Unfortunately, many of our public bodies' websites include only these numbers for customers to call.  The fictitious belief is that they are low-charge or flat-rate numbers, but they are only so when one calls from a landline, not from a mobile.  We are in an era now where very few people, in particular in the younger generations, know what a landline is.  All of our business is being done via mobile.  While the phone numbers in question are referred to as low charge or flat rate, the flat rate is 4 cent per minute, approximately, on average across the different providers.  However, if one rings those numbers from a mobile, the average can go up to closer to 40 cent per minute, which is a tenfold increase.<\/p> <p>Everyone is aware that when one rings one of these bodies, one will be put on hold and bounced around from option 1 to option 2 or 3.  A phone call can easily take ten minutes, which is &euro;4 for people who cannot afford it and who need the services.  A few of the services brought to my attention or seen by me in my research only have these numbers on their websites.  These include the National Driver Licence Service, PAYE inquiries to Revenue in Westmeath and the Data Protection Commission.  Public services and bodies should be obliged to include a landline number because most mobile providers now provide packages where calls to landlines are low-cost anyway.  People who need a service should not have to pay up to 40 cent per minute to try to get through to a human being on the other end of the line.  This needs to be done and it is remiss of the bodies concerned not to have a landline along with those so-called \"low-cost\" numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#K00300","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Brexit is looming very large and we are coming to the end game.

The latter would give rise to a reduction in income of &euro;1.69 million.  Property tax generates funding and it is a disincentive to leaving properties vacant.  If property tax is reduced, that encourages people to leave properties vacant.  I am somewhat surprised that, on the one hand, Sinn F&eacute;in wants more action taken in respect of housing but, on the other - and by means of taxation reductions - it would encourage owners to leave properties vacant for longer periods.  The party needs to clarify this.  It is unfortunate that when there has been a real increase in income in this country, it is talking about reducing property tax when in real terms it is beneficial to local councils and the services they provide.

The important point for the Senator to recognise is that talks are going on about the budget.  This day fortnight it will be revealed.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is finalising his budget package and is engaging with members of the Senator's party on it.  There will be lots of speculation, lots of kite-flying and hyperbole around the budget.  It is important to recognise that the ESRI figures acknowledge that the Irish economy is growing and there is a need for a prudent approach to be taken but that there are risks and, as we know and Senators Feighan and Leyden have said, Brexit is the most substantial risk we face.  We will have to face it.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit.  Brexit is bad.  The <i>status quo<\/i>will not remain.  There will be profound change, no matter what happens in the final outcome of Brexit because what we have now will not be the way.

Last year, 945 dwellings were remediated and contracts were being awarded or work was under way in the case of a further 129 properties.

Both he and his mother deny the charges brought against him.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Department are aware of the case and ready to help.  There is a complication in that Mr. Binder was born in Germany.  It is important that the Department is ready to help and that the matter has been raised in the House today.  It is a source of concern that a young man who has engaged in humanitarian work has been wrongly accused, as I believe he has been, having read some of the information.  I stand to be corrected on that.  It is a matter of extreme importance that we get the matter resolved quickly so that Sean can return home.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue of pharmaceutical assistants who work under a licensed pharmacist.  It is extraordinary that 248 people are being penalised by recommendations made by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  Those recommendations are wrong.  We should acknowledge that pharmaceutical assistants provide assistance to pharmacists.  In many cases, they have vast experience, possibly much more than some of the pharmacists for whom they work.  They assist and are a source of relief.  They also have a very positive impact on the sector.  As Senator Byrne rightly said, this will have a profound impact on the work of pharmacies and chemists in our communities.  I hope there will at least be a review of the decision and a stay put on it.  I commend Senator Byrne on raising the matter.  The Irish Pharmacy Union has been in contact with the Minister, seeking to have the restrictive rules changed.  Very strict conditions already apply and I hope these rules will be reversed.  I thank members of the Irish Pharmacy Union who have contacted me about the matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Leyden raised the issue of the new boundaries for the European Parliament.  An independent commission was established, which has produced the report.  It would be inappropriate to comment further other than to note that the commission has allocated extra seats to different areas.<\/p> <p>Senator McFadden raised the issue of assistant psychologists in Ireland.  I agree with her about the role they can play in our mental health system.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, has examined the psychology aspect of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, where we have waiting lists.  I hope we can allow for a particular and significant role to be played by our assistant psychologists with regard to the matters raised.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine raised the issue of public service pay.  I note that a number of meetings will be held with different unions today regarding public sector pay.  Under this Government, we have seen a restoration of pay to public servants, a reduction in the universal social charge and changes to the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The report published under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act will result in further changes.  It is important to recognise the need to be measured in our approach to public sector pay.  The Senator spoke about the health system.  As a public servant for my entire adult life, I understand and appreciate the value of the role played by nurses, doctors and other healthcare assistants and professionals.  The important, evidence-based report by the Government allows for further changes and I hope we will see a continuation of those changes in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#M02300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Recruitment and retention was ignored and dismissed by the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#M02400","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>It was addressed by the commission.

We must ensure the HSE will examine the delivery of home care packages because it is my experience in advocating on behalf of those seeking such packages that there is a blockage in the system which should be addressed as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#N00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>It is a problem nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#N00900","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Paul Daly on the issue of telephone call charges, whether flat-rate calls or otherwise.

The Bill completed its passage through the Lower House in July with broad support, following positive and constructive engagement with Deputies.  Officials of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation will be happy in the next few weeks to engage with Senators who have questions about the Bill or require clarification on any of its provisions.<\/p> <p>The Bill is aimed at overcoming barriers to innovation and modernising the existing copyright regime for the digital age.  It is not to be confused with the ongoing negotiations in Brussels on a proposal for a copyright directive.  If that proposal is agreed to, separate transposing legislation will be required in Ireland in due course.<\/p> <p>The Bill is the result of detailed analysis and examination, both from a legal and a policy perspective, of the recommendations contained in the copyright review committee&rsquo;s 2013 report entitled, Modernising Copyright.  The regulatory impact assessment which is available on the website of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, outlines why certain recommendations were not implemented.  It was due mainly to legal conflicts with existing EU law, the significant costs involved, the resulting administrative burden that could arise from implementation, or the lack of sufficient evidence supporting certain recommendations.<\/p> <p>Owing to the diversity of the Seanad, many in this House will be aware of copyright.  As a result, I expect to see interest in the Bill.  The overall aim of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on copyright matters in the Bill and in general is always to find the best balance between the rights of right holders in respect of their creative endeavours, the desire of consumers to access that creative content and those intermediaries who facilitate that access and ensure right holders are suitably remunerated for their rights.<\/p> <p>Turning to the Bill, as it is quite detailed legislation, with a substantial number of sections, I do not propose to address each of them but will instead outline the main provisions.  I can, of course, provide additional detail on any aspect, if required.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, and his officials will be available in the coming weeks to clarify any piece of information or go into more detail, if need be.<\/p> <p>The Bill amends several existing definitions contained in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, as amended, and provides for the inclusion of five new definitions, which is important to consider when reading the Bill.  The Bill introduces the following changes to copyright law in Ireland.  Section 4 renames the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks as the Controller of Intellectual Property.  Subsequent amendments in sections 40 to 42, inclusive, carry this change across the other intellectual property Acts, namely, the Copyright and Related Rights Act, the Patents Act 1992 and the Trade Marks Act 1996, and change the name of the Patents Office to the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland.  These amendments better reflect the full breadth of the role of both the controller and the office across all intellectual property in Ireland, as well as the more standardised naming convention for such offices across the European Union.<\/p> <p>The Bill improves access to the courts system for intellectual property infringement claims, particularly for lower value cases of intellectual property infringements.  This is achieved in section 5 by extending the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court to hear intellectual property claims, permitting right holders to bring lower value intellectual property infringement claims for relief in civil proceedings within the limits of these courts.  The provision will improve possibilities for enforcement of intellectual property claims, especially those that would not be economical to prosecute before the High Court, which is the general approach at present.  In sections 38 and 39 relevant amendments are also included to the Courts of Justice Act 1924 in respect of the jurisdiction of the District Court and to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 in respect of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to ensure the rules of the court allow such cases to enter the lower courts.  Later sections of the Bill, namely, sections 46 to 79, inclusive, and 82 to 104, inclusive, make the necessary amendments to the Patents Act 1992 and the Trade Marks Act 1996, respectively, which amend references to \"the Court\" to show whether the matters relevant to each section should be referred to the High Court or the \"appropriate court\" in those Acts.<\/p> <p>The introduction of a text and data mining copyright exception is provided for in sections 13 and 29.  Text and data mining is the use of advanced automated data analytics techniques to examine text and other data for patterns, trends and other useful information.  This usually requires copying of the work or database to be analysed to facilitate scientific research.  The exception will be of particular importance to the research and scientific community and in the context of big data projects which rely on underlying data analytics to produce new results and uses for the results.<\/p> <p>The Bill extends the existing copyright exceptions for education and research into Irish law as proposed by the copyright review committee.  Several sections amend the Copyright and Related Rights Act, namely, sections 14, 28, 29, 43 and Schedule 1, expanding the existing provisions on exceptions to copyright and related rights for the purposes of education.  The provisions contained in the Bill will expand many of the existing provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act to the full extent allowed by the information society directive, Directive 2001\/29\/EC.  The exceptions contained in the directive allow for the use of copyrighted works without the express authorisation of the right holder and the need to compensate the author.  The Bill also includes protection for right holders by making these exceptions subject to a licence override, where suitable licences are available.  This will allow educational institutions to benefit from access to copyrighted material, while serving to protect right holders&rsquo; commercial objectives.<\/p> <p>Section 27 contains a modest amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act that broadens the copyright deposit system, enabling copyright deposit institutions to accept published material in digital format, as well as or instead of physical copies.  This allows copyright deposit institutions in Ireland to accept publications in electronic format on a voluntary basis, while creating an obligation on publishers to comply with any request for such material in an electronic format.<\/p> <p>A disability exception, originally proposed by the copyright review committee, is contained in the Bill.  The definition of disability is amended and updated to the meaning assigned under section 2 of the Disability Act 2005.  The amendment is of importance as the Bill expands the existing exception to copyright for the benefit of persons with any disability in sections 24 to 26, inclusive.  The provisions provide for the greater availability of suitably modified versions of copyrighted works for use by persons with a disability, as allowed under the EU information society directive.  Currently, designated bodies that represent the interests of persons with a disability are only allowed to make a single modified copy to meet the individual needs of an individual person with a disability in response to a specific request, placing undue burdens on such bodies and organisations.  The amendments allow designated bodies to create multiple copies to have available for the needs of disabled persons and facilitate transmission of these copies to other designated bodies, as well as directly to individuals with a disability.  Designated bodies will be permitted to request a copy of a work which can then be copied and modified for the specific needs of a person with a disability.  This will then allow that body to create additional copies of the modified work for use by persons with a disability.  Given advances in technology, it may also be possible for persons with a disability to undertake necessary modifications using suitable software, etc.  Taking these advances into consideration, the Bill features a new provision that allows an individual person with a physical or mental disability to make a personal copy of a work which is modified to meet their special needs, rather than having to obtain such a modified copy from a designated body, allowing such persons a level of independence and not placing an onus on them to rely on a third party.  The Bill also sets out a new provision that introduces an anticipatory duty on publishers to make suitable copies of the work available to designated bodies on request.  This will facilitate the bodies to make suitable modified copies available for persons with a disability. <\/p> <p>The Bill amends the Patents Act 1992 to take account of two technical issues that have arisen from the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Act 2017.  Section 40 of the Bill which provides for the opening up of the national route for Patent Cooperation Treaty, PCT, international applications was amended on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The amendments are extremely technical in nature and were necessary to ensure there were no unintended consequences as a result of the changes to the Patents Act 1992.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The purpose of section 127A is to open the national route for PCI applications by allowing patent applicants to choose to convert an international patent application into a national patent application.  This ensures that the applicant in not required to lose his international application; he can choose the national route of his own volition.<\/p><p>The second issue arises from an unintended consequence of an amendment to section 31 of the Patents Act in the recently enacted Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Act 2017.  Prior to the amendment, when a patent application was received by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks it was subject to a formalities check to ensure that the application had been completed correctly and met the minimum standard set out in the Patents Act to qualify as a valid patent application.  Should the application not meet the required standards, it could be refused.  Following the implementation of the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Act, patent applications that do not meet the minimum standard cannot be refused after this formalities check, but instead must be subject to substantive examination and investigation before being refused.  It was never the intention to remove the power of the controller to refuse patent applications that did not meet the minimum standard.  Therefore, it is necessary to correct this unintended consequence by removing the text inserted by the amendment to section 31(1) of the Patents Act 1992 and returning it to its original format through section 40 of this Bill.<\/p><p>There are a few technical amendments.  While the Bill implements many of the recommendations of the \"Modernising Copyright\" report, it also makes other technical amendments to the copyright regime.  Section 6 clarifies that the authorship of a soundtrack accompanying a film shall be treated as part of the film.  Section 7 clarifies that perpetual copyright does not exist in certain unpublished works.  Section 9 provides a 25-year term of protection for previously unpublished works.  This is subject to first obtaining the consent of the owner of the work.  Section 10 makes it an infringement, in the context of photographs, to tamper with metadata associated with the photographic works.  This will allow for better protection of photographs, particularly in online use.  Sections 10 and 32 to 36, inclusive, strengthen the provisions on rights protection measures, including extending the protection of rights protection measures to being a matter for civil infringement proceedings taken by a rightsholder or licensee as well as a matter for criminal infringement proceedings.  Section 23 clarifies the rights of a person acting on behalf of a broadcaster with regard to the copying of a work by the insertion of a new subsection that will allow copying for the purpose of a broadcast or cable programme to be extended to a person acting on behalf of and under the responsibility of the broadcaster.  Section 37 clarifies the duration of copyright in works provided for in paragraph 9(1) of the First Schedule of the Copyright and Related Rights Act by the inclusion of additional text.<\/p><p>There are also provisions to correct an oversight at the time of the euro changeover.  These result in a technical amendment to each of the thee older intellectual property Acts already in force - the Copyright and Related Rights Act, the Patents Act 1992 and the Trade Marks Act 1996 - to convert their existing monetary amounts for fines and convictions from Irish punts to euro amounts and, where suitable, to amend those monetary amounts to the relevant classes of fines as stipulated in the Fines Act 2010.  These provisions are found in sections 44, 80 and 105 and Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.<\/p><p>In respect of the term of protection for copyright in designs, the Bill repeals sections 31A and 78B of the Copyright and Related Rights Act which relate to the existing 25-year term of copyright protection for designs and artistic works under the Industrial Designs Act 2001.  New provisions bring these works under the standard copyright term of protection being made in sections 8 and 20.  The current 25-year term of copyright protection for designs and artistic works conflicts with the standard copyright term of protection that applied to artistic works, which lasts for the life of the creator and a further 70 years.  Following a ruling in a case before the Court of Justice of the EU, Ireland must amend its legislation regarding the term of protection for copyright in designs and artistic works to ensure that these works receive the full copyright term of protection of 70 years after the death of the creator.  In order to provide businesses with sufficient opportunity to comply with any amendment, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation conducted a public consultation to obtain the views of stakeholders and subsequently has opted for a two-step transition period of 12 months from the date of entry into force of the Bill.  This ensures that Irish legislation complies with our international obligations while giving businesses sufficient opportunity to respond to the changes and to sell off existing stock that would not comply with the amended provisions.<\/p><p>There are also exceptions permitted by the EU information society directive.  This Bill implements several such optional exceptions.  These include extending the concept of fair dealing in copyright works for purposes of news reporting in sections 11 and 21; creating an exception to copyright for use of copyright works to allow for caricature, satire and parody in section 12; making increased provision for the use of works by libraries and archives, including allowing libraries, archives and educational institutions to make a copy of a work in its collection for preservation purposes, and for inclusion in catalogues for exhibitions in sections 15 to 19, inclusive, 31 and 32; and expanding the exception to allow bodies to produce a copy of a work for the advertisement of a public exhibition, as well as for the sale of an artistic work in section 22.<\/p><p>I would like to inform this House that during the Bill&rsquo;s passage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a Government amendment was accepted which amended text at section 40.  In addition, one Opposition amendment was proposed, which the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, was happy to accept, which resulted in the addition of a new section 106 that requires the Government to issue a report within 12 months of enactment on the feasibility of establishing a digital legal deposit scheme to allow for the copying and archiving of material on .ie domains on the Internet.  I am pleased to commend this Bill to the House on behalf of the Minister of State who, again, apologises that he could not be here today due to an issue that came up.  He certainly looks forward with interest to the contributions of Members on this and subsequent Stages of the Bill in this House.

During my past lecturing in law I did some work in the area of intellectual property so I am aware of what a minefield it can be and of how dry and technical in nature it is while nonetheless involving very important issues of the public good, as we heard when the Minister of State was speaking on the various sections.  Perhaps even more of a minefield is the fact that we are in this age of Internet downloads, streaming, data mining, social media, and so on, all of which have really forced us to look again at how we should balance the rights of copyright holders with the realities of modern communications and the use of copyrighted material.  This Bill is exceptionally detailed and technical legislation.  It strikes a good balance between protecting copyright holders and taking account of the modern world and the desire for, or desirability of, reasonable use of copyrighted material in reasonable circumstances, such as use in educational settings.  The fact that these issues are being addressed by the Oireachtas sends a good message about Ireland as a knowledge economy in which innovation and information are valued and their importance understood and in which people can profit from their ideas as a result of them being protected to a reasonable degree within our laws.<\/p> <p>In particular I welcome the provisions of the Bill which allow intellectual property infringement actions to be brought before the District or Circuit Courts within these courts' jurisdiction.  I recently spoke in the House on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and made the point that we are in danger of our courts system being brought into disrepute not by cronyism or judicial bias, as the Minister, Deputy Ross, would have us believe, but by a combination of delays caused by judicial vacancies, particularly at appellate level, and by high costs which act as a barrier to access to the courts.  There is also still a range of areas where actions are reserved to the jurisdiction of the High Court alone.  It is good to see one of these being taken back for consideration by the lower courts, as arises here.  Allowing infringement actions of lesser value to be brought at District and Circuit Court level is a positive step as it will allow rightsholders who may be of limited resources to pursue an action to protect their rights where they might otherwise have been afraid to do so due to the cost of a High Court action.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An important principle that people talk about is access to justice.

I also have a particular interest in the issue of text and data mining and the exceptions to those as they refer to education and research. which are critically important.

Copyright is the principal tool used by creative workers to generate sustainable income and wealth and protect their share of the value that they create.

The British Equity collection service distributed more than &euro;10 million to UK performers for their work in British film and television.<\/p><p>Copyright prevents third parties from profiting from the labour of creative people without paying for the exploitation of that labour.  Historically, it is the artist's protection against the extraction of value.  Writers, directors, designers, visual and plastic artists, songwriters, composers etc. all own the copyright on the work that they make.  It is illegal to sell on or otherwise use or profit from a text, a performance or an image without the express permission of the creator of that text, performance or image and without providing mutually agreed equitable remuneration for that use.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State explain further why the copyright council, which was recommended within the report that I mentioned, has not been catered for in this Bill?  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, in response to my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, stated that it is Government policy to reduce quangos and that the establishment of a copyright council had not been fully quantified on that basis.  That is a very poor reasoning and, when substantial reports like this one are worked on and one of the core recommendations is so easily dismissed, that sets a bad precedent.<\/p><p>The Australian Copyright Council, the Copyright Council of New Zealand, and the British Copyright Council all cover the duties and functions similar to what is outlined in the Modernising Copyright report.  These are all private, not-for-profit bodies that are funded primarily, I presume, through membership fees.  A private not-for-profit approach with a membership fee could also be taken in Ireland, as suggested in the consultation paper.  Work and consultation could also be done through the Department to help launch such a body that would establish an advocacy, advisory and stakeholder-led copyright council.  With the booming screen industry and with famous music and visual art industries, we have further expert-led opinion advising on policy to protect our artists' intellectual property.  I may table amendments on this area on Committee Stage, but I would like to hear the Minister of State's response regarding the establishment of a copyright council.<\/p><p>In addition, and I have spoken on this on numerous occasions, I am very disappointed that the Bill has not facilitated a legal digital deposit.  I am conscious that an amendment was passed at the behest of Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il to bring about a feasibility study.  We need to be conscious of our general acceptance that what goes online stays there for ever.  The reality, from those who have done their homework on this, is that 35% of what goes online is not available the following year, and much less is available ten years later.  Our libraries and national institutions have a responsibility to archive all physical publications in this State, and it is of great importance that we do not lose what goes online because this is an issue of national memory.  I refer to things such as recent referendum campaigns and all such matters.  The National Library has the ability to sweep the <i>.ie<\/i>domain.  I believe 20 of 28 EU member states have digital legal deposits in place.  We cannot lose this information for future generations.<\/p><p>The legislation only allows for restrained depositing by our deposit institutions, who have to request to have publications archived rather than being allowed to sweep the domain regularly.  We are looking at the possibility of mass non-compliance where digital publications are not archived at all.  How would the National Library approach every individual publication or publisher?  It is not possible, and mass non-compliance will follow from this.<\/p><p>In addition, when the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, was in what is now the Department Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, they conducted a consultation in which 42 responses, or 90% of the people who were consulted on the issue, said we very much need to establish a digital deposit scheme.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has since moved to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which has responsibility for this, and the matter seems to be off the table or pushed down the line with no appetite to follow through on it.  This is of great concern and I reserve my right to table amendments on the issue in future debates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#R00300","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber today and I welcome this important Bill to the House.  As a member of Civil Engagement, I worked closely with Senator John Dolan, who has pushed tirelessly to raise disability issues in the House.  Having spoken with Senator Dolan and some of the leading organisations dealing with disability issues, I want to flag some of their concerns on Second Stage.<\/p><p>A key aspect of the Bill is that it allows for the transposition of an EU directive enabling us to ratify the Marrakesh treaty.  As has been noted, this treaty, adopted in 2013 by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, aims to improve the availability and cross-border exchange of books and other print material in accessible formats around the world for people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled.  This is a noble, important goal and something I am delighted to see Ireland supporting.<\/p><p>It is widely acknowledged that people who are blind and vision impaired continue to face many barriers in accessing books and other print material due to overly restrictive copyright provisions and related rights.  These are unnecessary barriers to inclusion that we should rightly be dismantling, as the treaty and this Bill are trying to do.  They seek to require contracting parties to provide modest exceptions or limitations on copyright holders in order to share works in accessible formats, and for cross-border exchange.  As a legislator, I am delighted that such work can improve a child's access to vital educational material that otherwise might not be available.<\/p><p>I will raise a couple of points highlighted by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, the national sight loss agency.  NCBI is a not-for-profit charitable organisation providing support and services nationwide to people experiencing sight loss.  It views the legislation as a positive step that will help many people in Ireland.  NCBI's library and media centre is the main accessible book production unit in Ireland.  It produces books in audio and Braille and provides guidelines for larger print productions.  At this point, the library holds more than 20,000 titles in accessible formats, and it works as a member of the Accessible Books Consortium, <i>bookshare.org<\/i>and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.  The Marrakesh treaty will have a real, tangible impact on the media centre, improving production schedules, inter-library loans and significantly increasing the number of books produced in accessible formats.  This is made easier by the fact that, as it stands, economic compensation will not be imposed upon authorised entities in Ireland for the distribution of accessible works.  Such compensation schemes, which are optional for EU member states, make it harder and more expensive to produce and share accessible books.  I am glad the Government is proceeding in this manner.<\/p><p>NCBI was also pleased to note the Government will not apply the second optional clause in the treaty, which allows countries to ban the creation of accessible copies if the copyright owner has previously made the work commercially available.  This could mean an academic textbook cannot be converted into e-Braille if it has already been released by the publisher in this format.  Again, this is about pushing for more inclusion and making vital resources like textbooks as available as possible. <\/p><p>However, the NCBI raised concerns about the definition of the term &quot;authorised entity&quot; used in the legislation.  It asks that the definition be amended to mirror the definition used in Article 2 of the Marrakesh treaty.  This has a wider scope and includes non-profit organisations that provide services &quot;to beneficiary persons as one of its primary activities&quot;.  This would slightly extend the capacity of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to help in this vital work.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to this recommendation.<\/p><p>Similarly, would authorised entities need to seek a licence from the Minister?  The NCBI believes that its library and media centre, a fantastic resource, should be considered as an authorised entity for the purposes of this legislation because it has systems in place to maintain the integrity and security of works.  I flag this issue at this stage of the debate.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would comment on this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#S00100","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I will not take my full time as I will speak to only one aspect of the Bill.  It relates to the Minister of State's opening comment that the Bill is the result of detailed analysis and examination of the recommendations contained in the copyright review committee's report of 2013, Modernising Copyright.  While the Bill is said to take account of certain of these recommendations, I have been briefed that the problem is that the Bill only takes account of those recommendations in favour of big content and does not implement the balancing recommendations made in that report in favour of users.  The concern is that\u00a0the\u00a0Bill\u00a0is\u00a0unbalanced\u00a0because\u00a0it\u00a0seems to ignore the\u00a0copyright review\u00a0committee's\u00a0main recommendations relating to users.  This means that current common practices, like private copying and format shifting, are infringements of copyright, which should not be the case.  Committee Stage is fairly soon, and this matter has only been brought to my attention in the past 24 hours.  I hope to introduce amendments on Committee Stage based on the copyright review committee recommendations to give effect to\u00a0normal user expectations.<\/p><p>The report states:  <\/p><blockquote>if the exceptions are too narrow, this could stifle\u00a0user innovation, to say nothing of freedom of expression... \u00a0Accommodating basic and\u00a0genuine user expectations alongside the legitimate interests of rights owners makes\u00a0copyright law stable and sustainable, thereby contributing generally to cultural\u00a0and economic development and innovation.<\/blockquote> <p>It subsequently states:<\/p><blockquote>the main argument in favour of private copying exceptions relates to users' reasonable assumptions and basic expectations.  Users now commonly assume and expect that, if they buy content for personal (as opposed to commercial) use, they should be able to access it in various formats and across multiple devices.  As a consequence, many users routinely make copies for private use, and do not believe that this is or should be against the law.  Failure to\u00a0acknowledge this would diminish respect for the system of copyright and\u00a0undermine the credibility of copyright legislation. <\/blockquote> <p>That is a critical quote relating as it does to the real, day-to-day practice of many users and the impact that copyright law has.  The point is that users routinely copy materials for private use without believing that this in any way breaches copyright legislation.  This should be in some way recognised in law, as the review committee recommended.  Exceptions could include amending the definition of fair dealing, providing for reproductions on paper for private use, permitting format shifting and back-ups, and\u00a0facilitating non-commercial, user generated content.<\/p><p>There are a number of ways the Bill could be strengthened.  I am not opposing it in any way but I am drawing the attention of the Minister of State, his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Business and Innovation, Deputy John Halligan, and his officials to the concerns many stakeholders have about the way in which the Bill purports to implement the recommendations of the copyright review committee.  I know the Minister of State indicated the regulatory impact assessment outlining particular reasons certain recommendations were not implemented, but a crucial question, one which  hope will be explored in more detail on Committee Stage, is why the Bill appears to have a lack of balance in terms of the recommendations that are being implemented and those that are not.  I do not necessarily expect a response from the Minister of State today as it is more a matter for Committee Stage.  I am simply highlighting my intention to return to the issue on Committee Stage next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#S00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Senators who contributed to the debate.  I have listened intensely, as have the officials from the Department.  The various issues that have been raised will be considered further by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation as the Bill makes its way through this House.  It is intended to have Committee Stage on 3 October, which is next week, subject to the agreement of the House.  There may be a chance before that to engage with officials about some of the issues and concerns that Senator Bacik raised.  I will touch on them a little more in a moment.  The Senator may have missed it but I noted earlier that the officials will be pleased to engage with Senators on any issues they may wish to raise in the next week.<\/p> <p>This is detailed and technical legislation.  When implemented, it will organise and expand copyright and related rights in Ireland.  I will now address some but not all of the concerns raised.  I will revert to Senators with fuller answers if necessary in the next couple of days.  Senator Warfield raised an issue about capturing and preserving the web and having a full digital deposit system.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The committee's recommendation outlines the creation of such a system.  It is intended to facilitate the recording, archiving and utilisation for research purposes of websites with Irish domain names, which are not currently archived.  While the intention is to record material that may otherwise be removed from the web over time, it is a significant project that requires multi-institutional collaborations and significant resources and skill sets for capturing and preserving Ireland's digital record.  I was involved in some of this when I was in this Department a number of years ago.  It is a very complicated and an important area, and the Senator is right to highlight it.  It is in the report.<\/p><p>An amendment requesting the introduction of such a system was tabled on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and resulted in a good discussion with Deputies at the time.  The intention to capture the web for preservation purposes is a noble one.  However, it is a significant project and not simply a matter of amending copyright legislation.  That is a part of it but it would not be enough by itself.  Aside from any technical amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, other issues must be scrutinised when considering and developing any legislative changes.  Government issues and public interest issues impact rights holders.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is the Department with responsibility for policy in this area.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department have been actively working together on the matter for some time now and will continue to do so.  I want to ensure that a robust regulatory framework is developed and to facilitate the necessary corresponding legislative amendments in due course.<\/p><p>The amendment tabled on Report Stage, which calls for a report to be published on the matter within 12 months of the enactment of the Bill, was accepted and is viewed as a pragmatic way to advance the project while allowing time for the necessary work to take place.  The House can be assured that both Departments are actively engaged and a proposal on that report will be prepared as specified in the Bill.  I am conscious that the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is committed to this issue.  Senator Warfield probably wanted a quicker answer to his question, but there is a process to go through.  The commitment is there to do that.  Perhaps the acceptance of the amendment providing for a report within 12 months gives us an end date to having this ready.  The Senator might be happy enough with that or he might want to discuss the matter further over the week or two ahead, but the intention is there to achieve what he wants achieved.  I think we all see the merits of the proposal; it is just a question of being able to do it properly.<\/p><p>What does the Bill do in respect of digital deposits?  The copyright review committee recommends that the Bill broaden the copyright deposit system to enable existing copyright deposit institutions to accept published material in electronic format as well as, or instead of, physical copies.  This will benefit copyright deposit institutions, allowing them to collect non-print works to produce a shared archive of digital works and to facilitate the development of Ireland's national printed archive.  It will also allow for print works no longer published in hard copy format to be deposited and ensure that continued archive of important documents.  This includes many Government reports and documents which are no longer published in hard copy or as a matter of course, so this proposal will probably help in that respect.<\/p><p>Another question Senator Warfield and others raised concerned the copyright council.  It is true to say the copyright review committee recommended the establishment of a copyright council with a wide range of functions.  The committee envisaged that the board of the council would be comprised of a diverse range of stakeholders with an active interest in different aspects and agendas relating to copyright matters.  This ranged from individual authors, composers and photographers to organisations of a large scale with online platforms and included participation of representatives of user organisations, so a long list of people will be required for this.  With such a diverse range of stakeholders, it is likely there will be considerable difficulties trying to reach consensus on issues within the council and it will be very difficult to propose a unary view to the Minister in terms of policymaking.<\/p><p>The whole idea of having the council was to be able to bring forward recommendations to the Minister of the day.  We are not really sure if that will happen if all these diverse members are on the council.  Although the intention of the committee was that the copyright council would be self-financing, this new body will require significant resources in terms of the initial cost involved in the establishment of the council and the ongoing running costs such as staffing, premises, etc.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield mentioned solutions in his contribution.  These resources would need to come from within the resources of the Department, which is already stretched, to cover the broad remit of the statutory functions involved.  It is also the case that since the publication of the report, some of the proposed functions of the council are no longer necessary, such as the introduction of an orphan works licensing agency in Ireland.  Senator Warfield has raised the matter and we will tease it through, including the issues of the cost and the management of it.<\/p><p>It is fair to say that during the process, probably over the past five years, a long list of interested stakeholders has been assembled.  Over 400 groups or individuals are now involved in a consultation process with us as a Department.  If there are any issues of concern or any changes, they will be immediately consulted through email and so on.  This is in a way better than what was there before.  It is probably not quite what Senator Warfield wants achieved for the council, but there is that opportunity to engage now.  We have the list of people who are interested and we can move along more easily now.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the establishment of a copyright council has not been fully quantified, given the Government's general policy orientation at that time to reduce the number of new public bodies.  This goes back to what Senator Warfield said about quangos.  There is an aim, and there has been probably since 2011-12, to reduce the number of unnecessary quangos because they get very costly and they grow in their roles and their remits.  We are trying to avoid this unless it is really necessary, so it is probably the case that it has just not really been proven yet that the establishment of a copyright council is totally necessary.<\/p><p>There will be an opportunity to debate this more on Committee Stage if Senator Warfield so wishes.  Having been involved myself in this originally a couple of years ago, I am not convinced it is needed.  What is needed is that proper consultation, which I think is happening quite well now through the Department and the committee structure we have set up here, which I think works very well.  There is a cross-party approach to much of the work we do, and the committee is a great place to have this consultation.  However, if the Senator wants to press the case a little more with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, he can do so on Committee Stage later in the week.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield also asked a question about the necessary amendments to transpose the EU directive on the Marrakesh treaty.  This directive will be transposed by way of secondary legislation which will be completed by the specified transposition deadline on 11 October.  However, this Bill does make a number of changes to the provisions applicable to all persons with a disability.  The Bill will allow designated bodies to make multiple accessible format copies of works, transfer those copies to other designated bodies that need them and accept modified copies from other designated bodies.  This is a positive amendment which will provide persons with a disability with greater access to works, which I think we all want to achieve if we can.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly raised the benefits of text and data mining.  I think he is right.  This is why we are trying to make it a little easier.  He is right to say this will help research and projects in our educational institutes.  We are trying to encourage a lot more co-operation with our private business community along with our own State research community.  This means greater access to data with some great results through all the work being done, through Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the tech centres and involving all the various Departments.  It is a matter of bringing that kind of information together and our science community together.  This will benefit them, and the Senator is right to highlight that.  It can lead to great results.  He also welcomed the deposit system and the paper society.  I think I responded to those points earlier.<\/p><p>A few other points were raised by, I think, Senators Reilly and Mullen on enforcing rights in a modern digital age.  It is right to say that access to the lower courts is a step in the right direction because we are all aware of the high costs of getting justice.  That cost often prevents justice, so we are trying to deal with and allow for that.  The Senators correctly highlight that.  I agree that enforcement is important, and the intention is to reduce the costs of accessing justice.  Changing the route to access should help reduce those costs, but that is something we can monitor as we go along.<\/p><p>To respond to the last question from Senator Bacik, I know she did not want a full answer on it, and there will be a chance over the week to engage, but the copyright review committee did recommend the introduction of a private copying exception into Irish law.  The recommendation outlined that the private copying exception would be framed for private and domestic uses and would cover reproduction on paper for private use, format shifting and reproductions for backup copies.<\/p><p>Copyright law in the UK was amended in 2014 to introduce a private copying exception without a levy.  This permitted people to make private copies of legally acquired content and allowed consumers to transfer their own CDs onto their MP3 players, for example, but not allow people to make copies and give them to other people.  The UK provision was successfully judicially reviewed based on insufficient evidence shown of the lack of \"harm\" caused to rights holders and thus quashed in 2015.  Given that the exception proposed by the copyright review committee for implementation in Ireland was similar to the failed UK exception, and our expectation that it would almost certainly be legally challenged and struck down, it was decided not to progress the committee's recommendation in this area.  Furthermore, my Department does not want to introduce a system of levies in Ireland that would impose additional costs on consumers.  This is something we are trying to avoid.  Again, though, there will be time over the next week or two for the Senator to look at the matter more with the Minister of State and his officials if she so wishes.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#S00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#T00300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#T00400","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 2 October 2018.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 2.05 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017: Committee Stage (Resumed)","time":1537954200,"counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#W00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>SECTION 15Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>There are a number of aspects of section 15 which I dealt with on the previous occasion and I do not propose to repeat myself.

Government amendment No. 57 which we have just passed was a way for the Government to seek to address that inconsistency.  I go back to look at the problem with the Bill that is being resolved by amendment No. 57.  It is a problem with the way section 10 which concerns the composition of the commission came to us.  Until now, there was an issue with a crucial part of the Bill, section 10(1)(g).  It refers to:<\/p><blockquote>a member, being a person who is&mdash;(i) a lay person, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) a member of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, nominated by that Commission under section 12...<\/blockquote> <p>It had not been included within section 18, the section which concerns a member of the commission who ceases to hold office.  While I see amendment No. 57 as a tidying up exercise, we sought to engage in our own tidying up exercise with amendment No. 58 which was discussed with amendments Nos. 13 to 23, inclusive, to section 10.  The Acting Chairman said it could not be moved because amendment No. 57 had been passed.  Now that it has been passed, the provision has been tidied up and there is now greater consistency between sections 10 and 18.  Will the Minister say how precisely the procedure will be operated when a member of the commission resigns and a casual vacancy results?  To be blunt, there is an issue with logistics and how the procedure will be run in practice.  If there is a casual vacancy for a very short period towards the end of a member's term of office, there will be a difficulty in how sections 10 and 18 correlate or may be read together, given that section 10 includes such a range of procedures for the appointment of members of the commission.  How will it work in practice, specifically, as Senator Michael McDowell pointed out, when a member's term of office is close to termination?  There will clearly be a casual vacancy.  Will it have to be filled at that point?  Will the commission be capable of functioning while there is a casual vacancy?  Section 18(2) states &quot;the casual vacancy so occasioned shall be filled&quot; and &quot;the person appointed under this subsection shall hold office for that period of the term of office of the member who occasioned the casual vacancy concerned that remains unexpired at the date of his or her appointment&quot;.  It begs the question of whether the commission will then cease to be capable of functioning for the period in which the casual vacancy remains unfilled.  How practical is this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#EE01700","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>On the last point raised by Senator Ivana Bacik, it could be argued that section 15(7) deals with the commission continuing to function, notwithstanding the fact that there is a vacancy in its membership, but it appears that section 18(2) is mandatory.

The commission may act under section 15, where procedures for it are set out.  It states: \"The Commission may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership\", but for how long can a vacancy persist?  For how long does section 15(7) operate to have a commission capable of continuing to function?  Presumably, if somebody was to resign immediately after being appointed, there would be a real question mark over the functioning of the commission if the vacancy were to remain unfilled for a lengthy period and the commission was to continue to depend on or refer to section 15(7) to give it ongoing power.  Should some timeframe be provided for in subsection (2) or is there some other timeframe provided for elsewhere in the many provisions of the Bill?  It is interesting that the nature of the language used is clearly mandatory in section 18(2).  Section 15(7) states: \"The Commission may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership\".

I see the point that the Senators have raised and say to Senator Bacik that the issue of whether the resignation or departure of a member of the commission might render the entire commission redundant was covered in section 15 which states that in any event the commission may act, notwithstanding that there may a be a vacancy or more.  Section 15(7) should deal with the point raised.<\/p> <p>As far as the very short term before the expiration of the office of the commission is concerned, the manner of appointment is under section 12(2) which states, \"The Public Appointments Service shall recommend a layperson for appointment by the Minister as chairperson following a selection process\".  If the timeframe is very short, maybe a few weeks as described by Senator McDowell, in order that the process would be able to meet the task before it, I could perhaps consider adding the words \"insofar as practicable\", which might meet the very unlikely scenario of there being a very short period of time.

These are issues that are remote but, to address Senator McDowell's point, if the commission is of the view that, in order to meet, it needs a replacement for a very short time and if, having regard to the mandate of the Oireachtas and the Public Appointments Service, that timeframe is not practical, I will consider between now and Report Stage whether we can insert the words \"insofar as practicable\" and that might meet Senator McDowell's point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#FF00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>SECTION 19<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 59:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 60 cannot now be moved because amendment No. 59 has been agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#FF00600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 60 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 61:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 62 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1537954200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 19, as amended, stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I did say earlier that there is inconsistency in the drafting and language of section 19(1)(f) which refers to a member nominated by the Law Society of Ireland.

While it may not have any practical import, it is internally inconsistent within section 19 between subsections (1)(f) and (1)(g) and it seems inconsistent with the procedure for appointment of practising barristers and solicitors as set out in section 13(1) and 13(2), where the chairperson of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland is referred to, and that is mirrored in section 19(1)(g) but the President of the Law Society of Ireland is not referred to, which marks an inequity between the two professional bodies.<\/p><p>I suppose it is no more than a discrepancy.

To be absolutely correct, no member is nominated by the Law Society.

To take up another point, the Minister said that he does not think the chairperson of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland or the president of the Law Society would nominate without reference to their respective councils or committees.  Clearly, that is a matter for the internal rules of those professional bodies.  Section 13 does not place any conditions on the nomination process.  One would have to read into sections 13(1) and 13(2) that the internal rules and procedures of the Bar and the Law Society were being followed by the chairperson or the president in each case.  I do not think one needs to set that out and would have thought that it goes without saying within section 13.  Similarly, in section 19, there is no need to say \"in accordance with the internal rules of the professional body\".  If one is referring in section 13 to two specific officers or elected representatives but one refers to just one of them in section 19 in the context of the Bar, that seems unequal or inequitable.  It is tidier to also refer to the relevant head of the Law Society in section 19(1)(f).<\/p> <p>As I have already said, it is simply a tidying-up exercise.  I do not think it makes a difference in practice but it would be better, given how many issues have arisen in respect of inconsistencies and dog's-dinner-style problems with this Bill.  I would like it to be tidy on coming out of the Seanad, in a way that it was not when it came to us from the D&aacute;il.  That is a fair point.  I am not casting aspersions on any Members of the D&aacute;il but am simply saying that the legislation did not come to us in a tidy and internally consistent fashion.  I hope it will leave this House in that fashion.  That is simply the spirit in which I am offering my point about the language in section 19(1)(f).  It should be directly comparable to the language used elsewhere in the Bill, notably section 13 and internally in section 19(1)(g).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#GG00400","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I do not fundamentally disagree with Senator Bacik.

Rather, they are there as representatives of the bodies themselves and not the person who acts as chairperson or president.  That said, I take the Senator's point about consistency in language.  If there is an issue in that regard, I am happy to look at it again but I cannot see how there can be any element of confusion or uncertainty about the fact that the person is sitting on the commission or a subcommittee thereof in any capacity other than as a representative of the relevant body rather than the body's chairperson or president.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#GG00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I do not want to labour the point, but I did not say that there is any uncertainty in the method of appointment.  Indeed, I was careful to say that this is just a matter of tidying up and a drafting issue.  It is about consistency in language between and within sections.  It is important to that extent but I did not suggest that it would cast any uncertainty over the appointment process.  In fact, when I first read the different provisions, it struck me as somewhat odd that we were referring in section 13(1) to the chairperson of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland and in 13(2) to the president of the Law Society of Ireland.  It would have been preferable to say \"the Bar of Ireland shall nominate\" or \"the Law Society of Ireland shall nominate\" because that is exactly the Minister's point - these are the bodies that the individual representatives are purporting to represent.  It would have made no difference in terms of procedure and might have sounded better to have said that it is the bodies that nominate.  Clearly, an alternative method of amending or tidying up would be to amend sections 13(1) and 13(2) to say the Bar of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland and to then just refer to the bodies in section 19 or anywhere else that it arises.  That said, it seems easier to include the president of the Law Society in section 19(1)(g).  Perhaps we did cover this during that late-night debate in July when we discussed section 13 but I am not sure why specific reference is made to the president and to the chairperson but since such reference was made and since that is the section as we passed it, it would be consistent to use the same language in section 19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018092600002#GG00600","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1537954200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I was looking back on section 11(5)(a) and (b) and thinking that if one ceases to be a practising barrister or solicitor, one ceases to be a member of the commission automatically.
