As the Chairman outlined, joining me today are council members, Mr Sebastian Barnes, Mr. Michael Tutty and Professor Michael McMahon, the latter being our newest council member.  I wish to put on the record of the committee our recognition of the positive contribution made by Dr. &Iacute;de Kearney during her four years as a member of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Also joining me are Mr. Eddie Casey, chief economist and head of the secretariat, as well as members of the council's secretariat, Mr. Niall Conroy, Ms Friederike Vogler and Mr. Killian Carroll.  We continue to value these engagements.<\/p> <p>  The council's latest report, published today, covers all aspects of our mandate, as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013.  It is important to note that the council's mandate does not cover commenting on the choice of individual tax measures or spending items or priorities, but rather to comment on the overall fiscal stance.<\/p> <p>  The domestic economy has shown continuing strong growth since about 2013.  It has recovered from a deep crisis and is now operating near capacity.  That is most visible in the labour market with the unemployment rate falling to about 4.5%.  The percentage of the population employed in prime age groups, those aged between 25 and 54, was above its pre-crisis peak at the end of last year.  Efforts up until 2015 to turn around a large budget deficit were successful.  The Government's debt ratios are on a downward path, creditworthiness has improved and the budget balance appears to be close to a balanced position when the effects of the cycle are accounted for.<\/p> <p>  However, the outlook for the economy is unusually uncertain.  On the one hand, the domestic economy could continue to outperform.  It could significantly overheat if housing construction expands at a faster pace than is expected or if migration flows and credit growth rates follow more typical patterns for a mature phase of an expansion in the economy.  On the other hand, there are severe downside risks.<\/p><p>A disorderly Brexit poses profound risks to the economy and public finances, as do changes to the international tax environment, an escalation of protectionist measures, the onset of a cyclical downturn in major trading partners and adverse financial developments, including those possibly arising from Italy.<\/p><p> Since 2015, there has been little progress to improve Ireland's budget balance, excluding interest costs, and Ireland's net debt ratio remains the fifth highest in the OECD when measured appropriately.  Reflecting this, creditworthiness is still vulnerable to rapid changes.  Government spending growth has accelerated in recent years and the Government has also allowed a pattern of spending drift to take hold.  Annual non-interest spending rose by &euro;2.4 billion in 2017; &euro;5.2 billion in 2018 and budget 2019 sets out plans for a rise of &euro;4.5 billion this year.  The pace of spending growth has risen from 4.5% in 2015 to 6.7% in 2018.  Spending increases within the year, over and above what was originally budgeted for, have also contributed to a faster than planned pace of expansion.  For 2019, there is more evidence of this.  In October, the Department estimated that gross voted spending would be approximately &euro;1 billion higher than planned for the year.  As it turned out, it was closer to &euro;1.3 billion higher than planned, with additional spending increases occurring in the final months of the year.  The overruns are evident even more so in the general data published by the CSO.  The council's critical assessment last November, for example, was based on a 2018 general Government expenditure increase that was &euro;500 million lower than shown by the eventual CSO outturn data published in April when one-offs are excluded.  On this basis, a within-year spending revision of &euro;1.9 billion is evident for 2018 compared with the stability programme update, SPU, 2018 estimates.  The additional &euro;300 million overrun appears to have been driven by anticipated underspends in non-health areas not having materialised  - these were factored into the budget day Estimates for 2018 - and higher than estimated social payments, including health service, housing assistance and other social protection schemes.<\/p><p> The council has adopted a new principles-based approach the aim of which is to make the assessment of the fiscal rules simpler and more robust, including using the Department of Finance alternative measures of the cycle.  On this basis, the objective of a structural balance of no worse than -0.5% of GDP was achieved in 2018 as the structural balance was estimated to be +0.2% of GDP.  However, there was a significant deterioration in the structural balance in 2018 and Government spending breached the limit for the spending rule in 2018.  This reinforces the council&rsquo;s view that the net spending increases in recent years have not been conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management.  The lack of progress comes against a backdrop of significant favourable factors. The economy has experienced a continued cyclical upswing, meaning lower unemployment related payments and higher tax revenues, while corporation tax has surged.  Both of these factors are likely to prove temporary.<\/p><p> The council&rsquo;s report shows that between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion of the &euro;10.4 billion corporate tax receipts received in 2018 could be considered excess.  In other words, beyond what would be projected based on the economy&rsquo;s underlying performance and based on historical or international norms.  Unlike typical revenue windfalls, these gains could persist for a number of years before reversals could be expected.  They also represent a net injection to the economy given that foreign-owned multinational enterprises contribute four fifths of corporation tax receipts.  As much of the improvement in Government revenues in recent years may be cyclical or temporary, this suggests that the structural position - looking through these effects - has deteriorated.<\/p><p> The council assesses that the Government should be cautious, reflecting the risks associated with a hard Brexit, the reliance on corporation tax, possibilities of overheating and the rapid rise in spending between 2017 and 2019.  For this year, the Government should stick to its existing plans as contained in SPU 2019.  This means that no additional within-year increases, including the payment of a Christmas bonus for weekly social welfare recipients, should be introduced without offsetting measures.  Further slippages, which imply a looser fiscal stance and contribute to overheating pressures, should be avoided.  To stem the increasing reliance on corporation tax receipts, any additional unexpected receipts should be allocated to a prudence account during the year and then to the rainy day fund or elsewhere.<\/p><p> For 2020, the Government should stick to its plans as set out in SPU 2019.  This would imply some &euro;2.8 billion of budgetary measures for 2020, including amounts already earmarked for increases in public investment, public sector pay, provision to cater for demographic changes and for assumed tax cuts in 2020.<\/p><p>This approach would mean minimal new tax and spending measures on budget day.  If further discretionary measures are to be introduced beyond SPU 2019 plans, the Government should introduce additional revenue-raising measures or scale back planned spending increases and tax cuts to preserve overall sustainability.  A smaller expansion than the &euro;2.8 billion would also be desirable, again, recognising the severe risks now faced.  This could include not using the &euro;600 million that is currently set aside for assumed tax cuts and unallocated spending increases. <\/p><p> The Government's budgetary plans for later years lack credibility.  Specifically, the medium-term spending forecasts are based on technical assumptions that appear unrealistic as they do not reflect either likely future policies or the future cost of meeting existing commitments.  The projections imply an implausible slowdown in spending growth, which leads to increasing surpluses in later years.  For example, gross voted expenditure is assumed, as a technical assumption, to grow at 2.5% per annum over the period 2020-23.  The spending growth forecasts for the later years would also be insufficient to cover the council's estimates of the standstill scenario of maintaining current public services levels and income supports, given demographic and price pressures.<\/p><p> The Government needs a credible strategy for the medium term.  A better approach to budgetary planning could be built around four key elements.  First, the Government's debt ratio target should be revisited.  It should be lower to reflect Ireland's volatile growth rates, should be restated as a percentage of modified GNI*, should be clarified as either a ceiling or target and should have clear staging posts.  Second, a clear statement of the sustainable growth rate at which net policy spending can grow is needed.  This could be informed by the Department's alternative estimates of potential output but any approach should try to correct for the risks of pro-cyclical bias present in such estimates.  Third, departmental three-year expenditure ceilings should be reframed around this medium-term growth rate and forecasts should be more realistic.  The current ceilings are evidently not working.  A better approach would see more realistic spending plans set out in advance and a strengthening of subsequent spending controls and monitoring. Fourth, a budgetary position less reliant on corporation tax receipts should be an overarching principle guiding fiscal policy in coming years.  Using a prudence account, as the council suggests, could help to achieve this.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to attend this meeting.

My compliments to the team for all their work on it.<\/p> <p>  In the short time available to me, I would like to cover three areas.  In regard to corporation tax, the council's conclusion is that between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion of the &euro;10.4 billion of receipts collected in 2018 could be considered excess or outside of the normal economic cycle and the underlying performance of the economy.

A review of historical norms and the performance of the economy would suggest that a significant share of it is not explained by the historical patterns or the performance of the domestic economy.  Given it has risen so quickly, it could fall as dramatically as it has risen in recent years.  It should be recognised that these are not forecasts or projections.  Rather, they are a modelling approach to identify what excess exists.  Our view is that we should not be reliant on receipt of these revenues over the medium term.  They could persist for a number of years but it is likely that there will be some reversal at some stage.  Public finances that are very much dependent on these potentially temporary receipts should be avoided.  We are not predicting a catastrophic collapse in corporation tax but our analysis suggests that we need to weigh up how much of it is an excess.  It is significant.  For example, in 2014-15, the forecast for corporation tax receipts at this point in time was approximately &euro;5 billion.<\/p><p>As it is, those receipts are approximately &euro;10 billion.

In overall terms, the Exchequer and budget balance look to be reasonably positive, but an issue is that it has been hugely flattered by these corporation tax receipts.

Our analysis is based on some of the scenarios created by the ESRI and Central Bank on the impact on Irish growth and carrying that through to the impact on the public finances.  If there was a dramatic slowing down in the Irish economy, an increase in unemployment-related spending and a drop in tax revenues, the deficit could become significant over a two or three year period and threaten some of the targets and ceilings set out in the Stability and Growth Pact.  Equally, we could see our debt ratio, which is currently in a downward projection, change direction.  In a very adverse scenario, one could begin to see the debt ratio start to rise again.  Some of the benign financial conditions we have seen in recent years could reverse.  One thing that has happened over the past number of years is that financial markets have paid very little attention to Ireland.  We are small and they simply look at a couple of headline numbers.  If one of the headline numbers on which they focused was debt to GDP, they might get a very misleading view of Ireland.  If our debt ratios began to start to rise and they were to start to look a bit closer at debt to GNI* not debt to GDP, where the former was heading for 100% and continuing to rise, the benign borrowing conditions of the last number of years could reverse quickly.  Not only do we have a large debt to refinance, a hard Brexit could mean a large deficit to finance and the current benign financial conditions would no longer prevail.  One of the consequences of recent fiscal policy is that we have not given ourselves sufficient room to absorb the potentially very large shock a hard Brexit could present to the Irish economy and public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>On the medium-term fiscal projections, Mr. Coffey says the Government's medium-term plans are not credible.  Until recently, we had only three-year projection on the fiscal side.  In April's SPU, we got five-year projections.  Mr. Coffey makes the point that there is a technical assumption underpinning it that current spending will grow by 2.5%.  Considering that we have a national planning framework which runs to 2040, a national development plan which runs to 2027 and a good handle on the demographic changes that are well under way and given the current pressures in the health sector, including home care, caring for the elderly, nursing home care and so on, can Mr. Coffey talk us through how the council reached the conclusion that the plans were not credible?  The council's report deals with the fact that the ratio of workers to pensioners will change significantly in the next 20 to 30 years.  There will be fewer workers paying into the tax pot to fund pensions.  As such, do we need a radical overhaul of how we do medium and, indeed, longer-term fiscal projections and budgeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#H00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560207600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Our main difficulty with the medium-term projections is that they are technical projections rather than policy ones.  Current expenditure is being projected to grow by a fixed amount of 2.5% rather than the Government looking at what it expects to do over the next number of years.  That 2.5% is very far below what has been happening in recent years and below what the economy can reasonably bear over that time.  We have seen over time that projections like that are never followed through but are in fact exceeded substantially in succeeding budgets.  We are looking for realistic projections which take account not only of demographic realities and inflation but of policy changes any Government will be likely to introduce.  That does not happen, however.  In my time in the Department of Finance it never happened either.  I am preaching things I was not able to do but the Government has been developing much better three to five-year forecasts in recent years.  However, the only time they tend to be realistic is when an actual plan is published, as we saw during the days of the IMF and ECB.  Outside that, all that seems to happen is that the Department of Finance says it does not have Government projections and therefore makes an assumption which is always very low.<\/p> <p>  It would certainly be desirable for the next three to five years to be able to set out exactly what it is planned to do.  One does not have to set out every expenditure measure one wants, but one should look at the level of expenditure that is likely to take place and how it will affect the economy and public finances rather than make technical assumptions which show a nice surface developing all the time which is just not going to happen.  To make projections in the more medium term is certainly desirable.  From a demographic point of view, it is very desirable indeed to make projections even to see what it will cost to maintain existing services.  That is not being done on a very sound basis at the moment.  One of the biggest difficulties with the Department of Finance's projections is that they assume there will be no pay increases other than the ones which have already been agreed.  The Department is reluctant to include anything in a forecast that suggests there might be more pay.  In summary, its projections are not realistic at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Tutty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560207600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael McGrath's question also addressed the longer term, which is very important.

Hopefully, we will be in a position to report on that in future sessions.  I make two points to emphasise what Mr. Tutty just said.  Even though some of these are long-term issues, they are also biting in the medium term.  By 2023, for example, the stand-still scenario presents a much less rosy picture for the surplus, largely as a result of these pressures.  Of course, the national development plan is built into the stand-still scenario and into the forecast.<\/p><p>That is to be encouraged and welcomed.

Those worked in opposite directions.  Supporting the financial viability of the State at the time made austerity, tax increases and expenditure cuts necessary whereas support for the economy would have involved the opposite, perhaps undertaking some form of investment programme in line with the suggestion that the Deputy made.  Our view is that we should avoid that trade-off.  If we are to face a situation where there is a significant downturn, we should have resources available and it is then up to elected representatives and the Government to decide how those resources can be used.  We want to avoid facing a situation where rather than boosting the economy and offering support, we end up making a cyclical downturn worse, which we have done repeatedly over the past 40 years.

I was impressed that, in one of his previous meetings with us, he said that one of the risks facing the economy is the cost of meeting our climate emissions reductions if we did not make real emissions change.  He said that the scale of the risk of that was large and that the impact was also large.  The national development plan which was agreed last June had no climate assessment done whatsoever, as we have since discovered.  The modelling that the Oireachtas joint committee did of the system to see what it would deliver showed that it would only deliver one third of the emissions reductions that we need.  In those circumstances, we are facing a fiscal cost of &euro;200 million for next year already.  In the medium term, we could be looking at a cost of &euro;600 million to more than &euro;1 billion each year.  Have the witnesses further assessed the risk of that?

The report makes for sober reading and should serve as a wake-up call about getting back on track and managing the economy prudently.  I will address the windfall of corporation tax receipts.  Given that 45% of corporation tax receipts come from ten companies, one would think that we would have been able to get under the bonnet a little better at this point to understand why we have this substantial windfall and tax returns coming in.  They seem to be broadly unexplained.  Nobody seems to know why.  The Government has at times suggested that it is because of aviation leasing or intellectual property but I think that is questionable.<\/p><p>Does Mr. Coffey have a view on that?

The aircraft leasing and IP onshoring we have seen in recent years are not drivers of the increase in corporation tax that has taken place.  Some links have been drawn between the two but while the aircraft leasing sector pays some corporation tax, it is not of the scale that we have seen.  The amount of additional corporation tax linked to the onshoring of IP in recent years is close to zero.  There may be payments in the future but they remain at zero currently.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers mentioned that the top ten account for a significant amount.  What is also the case is that there is significant movement - under the bonnet, as it were - within the figures.  The Revenue Commissioners are giving us lots of good information on what is happening but we would always like more.  One thing the information shows is that the top ten change from year to year.  Certain companies drop out and make lower payments and are replaced by other companies making higher payments.  It is not the same top ten every year.  We can take it that most of the top ten are foreign-owned but the share is significant.<\/p> <p>  As to how we can explain the increase in corporation tax, one way to do so is look at a comparison across other EU countries.  Other countries have experienced significant rises.  Since 2011 and 2012, corporation tax receipts in Germany and France have doubled.  That may be comparable to what we have seen here. Some of it could be a fallout from the end of the economic crisis, although our doubling took place in a shorter period and receipts have more than doubled.  Those countries have shown steady increases.  We had a bounce in 2015 and another bounce in 2018.<\/p> <p>  Moving away from the IFAC view to a personal one, we have not tried to explain why it has happened but it is possible that the nature and the type of companies in Ireland is playing a significant role.  If one looks at the type of foreign direct investment we attract, it tends to involve large and successful companies.  If companies are large and loss-making, there are limited advantages in coming to a low tax jurisdiction.  If a company is likely to generate losses, it wants to have a high tax rate against which to offset those losses.  The companies that tend to be here are large and profitable.  It may be that our corporation tax receipts are excessively linked to the international business cycle.  As there been an improvement in the position internationally, there is probably a higher elasticity of Irish CT receipts to the global economy.  The potential is that if the global economy suffers a downturn and we have that excess elasticity, we could then suffer a much greater drop in our CT receipts.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Lisa Chambers stated, the receipts are largely unexplained.  It could be down to changes in rules by the OECD or the EU or just the general activities of tax collection agencies around the world, but it does remain a risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey.  This is a matter in respect of which the committee should do further work.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to Brexit.  IFAC looked at the ESRI and also the Central Bank.  There is quite a gap between the forecasts or predictions of those two entities.  The committee previously discussed the fact that Government projections are all based on the central-case scenario to the effect that there will be an orderly Brexit.  We can all accept that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has increased.  Nobody knows what type of Brexit we will get or when we will get it.  My question is for either Mr. Coffey or Mr. Barnes.  In terms of the adjustment to the public finances that might be required in the event of a hard Brexit, I am looking at the percentage of GNI* -the outlook from 2019 to 2023 for the budget balance.  This year, we are looking at 0.3%.  In the event of a hard Brexit, on the basis of the ESRI figures it will be -1.9%.  The figure in the Central Bank's analysis is -3.2%.  It continues in that manner right along to 2023, showing that we could face a significant problem.  We could require a major adjustment in the public finances.  How does that compare with ten years ago?  If there is a hard Brexit, what adjustment might be needed?  What kind of space are we in?  Let us take, for example, the national broadband plan in respect of which there are promises that the bulk of the spending will take place in 2022 and 2023.  In the event of a hard Brexit, we could be looking at the debt ratio going up to 111%.  In effect, it would be going backwards.  How do our guests think we will cope with those major capital projects?  What kind of adjustment will be needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#M00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560207600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>This is an important matter.<\/p><p>It is hard to know what the likelihood is of that happening.  There is also much uncertainty regarding these estimates and that is conditional on a hard Brexit.  We thought, however, that it would be useful to think through the consequences in different cases.  I think the question from the Deputy is trying to do that as well.  We have taken two sets of estimates.  One came from an exercise led by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the other came from the Central Bank of Ireland.  Those exercises give us slightly different versions of a hard Brexit.  The version from the Central Bank is a much worse estimate.  These exercises illustrate well some of the uncertainties and different scenarios that might happen, even if there is a hard Brexit.<\/p><p> I will take the scenario from the ESRI first.  It is not quite as bad as that from the Central Bank but we still see a fairly reasonable deficit opening up in the next couple of years.  By 2020, that would be at -2.3%.  Turning to the version from the Central Bank, it is much worse.  It presents a scenario where the deficit opens up much faster and reaches much larger numbers.  I should state that relative to the analysis of the ESRI, for example, the fiscal impacts we present are much larger.  That mostly reflects a methodological difference.  We take a different view of how much the slowdown in the economy would feed through into the public finances.  It is an area where there may be legitimate disagreements but we think ours is a more realistic estimate based on our reading of the evidence.<\/p><p> The important aspect following that point is what the policy response could be.  It must be taken into account that a tightening of policy would also have a second round effect and would weaken demand.  The exercise we have done looks at what would be required to stabilise the debt ratio over a period of time.  The shocks considered are big enough to mean that, in some cases, not only would the slowdown in the GDP to debt ratio stop but it would actually go up again.  Trying to bring about stabilisation over a few years would have a major impact.  The simulations we referred to suggest &euro;4 billion would be needed if the fiscal adjustment was done very quickly.  If that was done over two years, then that total would accumulate to about &euro;5 billion.  These are, therefore, big adjustments.  They are smaller than what Ireland experienced in the wake of the financial crisis.  Nevertheless, these adjustments are very large and very different from the kind of scenario we would have in the baseline scenario.  That is why I think it is useful to raise this issue.  It also, however, underpins our policy advice to be cautious.  The better the starting position, the less that will have to be done if things go wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.

Representatives from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have been with us on several occasions since this committee was formed.  This sounds like this Government's \"soft landing\" moment.  Everything said today has been said on the last two occasions the witnesses have appeared before us as well.  The remarks on corporation tax have been stated on three occasions.  I notice that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, tweeted today that he will take the advice of the IFAC.  He also wrote that such advice was dismissed in the past and there were consequences as a result.<\/p> <p>  This advice, however, was simply not available in the past.

The IFAC has been consistent, along with the EU Commission, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the ESRI and the Governor of the Central Bank.  Representatives from all of those organisations have been before this committee.  There have been two common themes in what the IFAC has been stating in the last three years.  The first is the over-reliance on corporation tax.  The second, in the last two years, was the Government's aligning itself to a benign Brexit scenario.  <\/p> <p>  There is an interesting aspect to the fact that the Minister for Finance intends to heed the advice of the IFAC.  He appeared before this committee two weeks ago and he got very strong advice from his Secretary General in respect of broadband.  The Minister was pressed repeatedly on that issue.  The advice supplied to him included mention of risks to the reputation of the Government regarding economic management and competence and, indeed, the Government's reputation in general.  The Minister for Finance is still adhering to the view he is taking on the broadband issue, however.  <\/p> <p>  That is the context for my questions.  As with everybody who appears before us, the language used concerning corporation tax is very soft.  It includes words such as \"could be\", \"maybe\" and \"possibly\".

I do not know when but it will.  Corporation tax is the most volatile of our main taxes and this issue shows the raised level of volatility.  Without seeing the individual tax returns of these large companies, it is hard to get a handle on what is driving the increases.  We have seen those increases happening in a stepped fashion.  There was a greater than 50% increase in corporation tax receipts in 2015.  The increases then levelled off for 2016 and 2017 before we saw another large stepped increase in 2018.  It is hard, therefore, to identify what happened in 2015 and 2018 to cause those increases.  There are a number of factors.  We have more information about the 2015 increase because the Revenue has published the aggregate information from the tax returns it received.  It seems like the legacy of the crash was washing through accounts, with issues regarding companies returning to profitability and certain losses being exhausted.<\/p> <p>  There also seemed to have been a timing issue in 2015 for companies identifying this increase.  Looking at those company accounts, much of the additional tax revenue was due to profits that arose in 2014.  Those taxes were not paid in cash terms, however, until 2015.  The stepped increase in 2015 should possibly, therefore, have been spread out over a number of years.  That would then point to a more gradual increase.  We are not any different from other people analysing corporation tax receipts.  If there was a clear answer to be had, it would be made available.  Regarding the extent to which Irish corporation tax is exceptional, we can compare it to other EU countries that have also experienced large increases in their corporation tax revenues.  The difference is that our increases happened over a much shorter period.  The increases tend to be confined to over two years.  It is right that the language regarding corporation tax is couched with \"could be\" and \"maybe\" because we simply do not know for certain.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I will interrupt Deputy Lahart for a moment.

Previously, it would have probably been unheard of to have some of these risks outlined in such a clear fashion, such as in the annual debt report and the annual tax report that the Department of Finance publishes.

It would be different if there was a well functioning and well designed rainy day fund.  One reason to have it is for use in the event of a rainy day.  If the fiscal rules were to prevent that, it would limit the effectiveness of having that policy because the reason money is set aside in good times is to use it in bad times.<\/p> <p>  We looked at various ways in which that can be achieved.  The fiscal rules themselves are perhaps too restrictive and do not give sufficient benefit to setting aside resources in the good times.  There are various ways it can be taken into account.  One suggestion would be to count it as spending when the revenue is raised and when the rainy day fund gets the money put into it in the good times so that it makes the deficit appear worse at those times.  Then it is just spent at a subsequent time so it does not count against the deficit in the future and the capacity is there to spend it.  However, because of the way the system of accounts is designed and because of the way the fiscal rules are designed, that would be difficult to achieve.  It is about striking the balance between getting the benefit in the bad times for setting aside the resources in the good times.  There are various ways in which it can be done.

One of the concerns would be that if capital spending has got back to what one might consider normal levels, in the next downturn or the next fiscal crisis, that is the area that will be cut again.  We often turn to the pro-cyclical issues, and as capital spending is the one that can be perhaps adjusted that bit quicker, it exacerbates that situation.

The work done by Eddie Casey of IFAC outlined that very clearly in the paper.  Has the council's analysis changed?  As we know, in a downturn the current legislation only allows for moneys to be withdrawn to mitigate exceptional circumstances, which are natural disasters, recapitalisation of banks and major structural reforms, such as pension reforms, and not to support social welfare payments that may need to be supported because of rising unemployment, or additional investment in capital.

When it comes to the spending areas and the priorities that the Deputy has identified then our view is that sound fiscal policy in identifying and responding to those priorities are not an either-or situation but can be achieved at the same time.  For example, we have outlined that last year Government spending rose by &euro;5 billion.  This year, Government spending was planned to increase by something approaching &euro;5 billion.  Maybe there will be slippage and I could see that figure increase.  There are significant amounts of additional spending being undertaken.  If they are not going in areas that the Deputy has identified as priorities then maybe the choice should be among the reallocation of the additional expenditure of &euro;5 billion per annum.  If then one wants to go beyond that, one does not necessarily need a catch-up fund.  One just needs to find additional and sustainable revenue sources that will fund spending increases beyond those currently pencilled in.  The plans at present see a spending growth of in and around &euro;5 billion per annum for each of the last two years.  Therefore, I do not see what additional catch-up fund is needed if that is being achieved.  If additional priorities are identified then either reallocate funding from within that or identify additional but sustainable revenue sources.  One issue that the fiscal council would like to get across is that those who are in favour of an increased Government provision of services, and goods and capital spending across the economy should perhaps be more in favour of what we are suggesting because when a downturn hits, if it was to be quite adverse and led to some of the trade-offs that we have mentioned here, then those who will be affected, by definition, are those who are the most vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I am running out of time and I want to make another point.

Spats between IFAC and the Government are to be expected as par for the course.  I wish to discuss the summer economic statement of last year and later this month we will see another one.  In hindsight, last year's statement had significant areas of fiction to the point where I would christen it the \"summer economic novel\".  I say that because it is full of exciting potential but some of it is fiction.  In terms of the structural work of assessing how finances are run in this country, has IFAC given consideration as to why the statement was such a disappointment on the reality front?  Was it a mistake to abolish the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, as a separate, independent Department?  I know that the delegation members are not policy people but that was a mechanism for assessing what the likely costs and so on were to be.  Has that assessment suffered since?  More important, do we have room for tax cuts?  Clearly, the Taoiseach has earmarked around &euro;500 million for tax cuts.  As far as one can see, they are mainly at the upper end in terms of income tax.  While we are expanding spending, does IFAC think we have room for tax cuts?<\/p> <p>  Briefly, what happened last year, and most of the other years after about 2013, is that figures in November, which is after the budget, turned out to be vastly bigger than what had been anticipated in the budget.  Has the identification improved of what the November receipts are likely to be?  From my own professional experience, that is identifiable in a serious way from after July.  Has IFAC had any interaction with the Department of Finance to find out?  One gets a surge from the self-employed or the November receipts and then the Minister finds &euro;1 billion for the health service down the back of the sofa.<\/p><p>That is what we were all subjected to last year, which basically made a joke of the work of this committee.  Are we likely to have that experience again?  Will the &euro;500 million be back of the sofa money once again?  <\/p><p> In the statement and detailed statement, the witnesses also referred to echoes of the previous boom and crash, thereby indicating a sort of soft warning about the potential for a difficult period ahead.  What do they think has been left out?  They referenced the national children's hospital and broadband.  The Government's response is that there will be costs of between &euro;200 million and &euro;400 million per year, there is nothing to see there and nothing to worry about.  However, this is cumulative and we do not know whether the figures will be flat each year or whether there will be bumps in expenditure in some years.<\/p><p> We have lost all sight of pension provision because that seems to have been long-fingered by the Government.  Have the witnesses had any discussions around it?  Where have the pension figures gone because we are not hearing them?<\/p><p> There is no green fund for the economy.  We have just declared a climate change emergency.  I estimate, conservatively, that it will cost roughly &euro;1 billion per year after the first 18 months for public transport, retrofitting houses and farm greening measures.  A climate change emergency has been declared by the D&aacute;il.  I think we can anticipate some element of a climate change budget.  <\/p><p> I have always been an advocate of a minimum effective tax rate.  I do not know whether anybody else in the D&aacute;il has ever agreed with me.  At this late hour and with the corporation tax structure as it stands, is there is still an argument for bringing in a minimum effective tax rate?

Therefore, if there are two separate Ministers in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, respectively, some other area loses out.

One issue we raise in the report - we did not look it at very carefully in the past - is that if one looks at the monthly spending profiles, they are very strange and assume a large fall in December which often does not happen or, at least, not to the same extent.  It is important to have accurate monthly profiles, but it is very odd to have this one.

Having a budgetary oversight committee is relatively new in Ireland.  Surely systems have been in place over the years in other countries.  While I know that this is a small economy and that we cannot necessarily control outcomes or some of the issues that arise, surely we learn from best practice.  The delegates have said there are political decisions to be made and that the council endorses assessments and gives us advice.  Based on what they know, if they were involved in the political system, what would the delegates do in taking the corrective action needed?  They talk about GDP and GNI*.

For this reason, I would be as prudent as I can be.  I would take steps which, at the very least, stuck to my plans.  This is the exact point of view that is driven home in my report.  I would err on the side of caution, in layman's terms, and take a very careful position.  <\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question on GDP versus GNI* being agreed across Europe, the rest of the European economies and most economies across the world use GDP as the accepted measure.  It is precisely in the case of a small number of mostly small, open economies that GDP ceases to be a relevant measure.  I do not imagine that we will be successful in convincing the rest of the world to move from GDP to GNI*.

If we take the economy in the period from 1999 to 2015-16, looking only at the end points, we would consider it a remarkable performance, with huge increases in employment, income and living standards.  That would be to miss out the bit in the middle, however, which is that we surged way too high in 2008, dropped in the years to 2012 and then made a rapid recovery.  If we had achieved stable growth from 1999 to 2015-16, taking exactly the same end points, it would be considered a remarkable performance but there was great volatility in that period.

The difference now, apart from voices on the Opposition benches and an over-reliance on regulators, is that we have at our disposal EU fiscal rules, departmental ceilings and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.

As has been recently exposed, none of this occurred in the cases of the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan.  The Government is now faced with the predicament that it must find an additional &euro;1.5 billion in the years to 2027 under the contract it is considering signing.

I think I understand their critique which, in layman's terms, is that given the uncertainties in the economy and outside it, including Brexit, a possible downturn, the onset of protectionism and an over-dependence on corporation tax receipts, we could be in a very vulnerable position.  In that context, having spending Estimates which may be less than realistic, given the commitments the Government has made, could cause big problems if any of these chickens comes home to roost.  That is, more or less, the critique of the council.  Of course, that still leaves all of us the political conundrum of what to do with it.  It seems that, in broad terms, we have three choices.  We can spend less, raise more revenue or manage projects better.  The answer would probably include all three, but a trickier question is trying to figure out the key ways to deal with the problem.<\/p><p>I put it to the delegates that, given the size and openness of the economy and its vulnerability to all of the things to which they referred, there is almost nothing we can do <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the unpredictables.

The economy does not need a fiscal stimulus.  If there are spending priorities, space should be made for those through increased tax revenues.  If the downturns are to hit in the future and we want to avoid facing a trade-off between supporting the economy and rebuilding our financial credit worthiness, if we had a better starting point, we would be better able to absorb those shocks.

I know that it cannot be too political, but it is flagging certain concerns.  Is it concerned about what private property sector interests could potentially do to us, given the dependence of Rebuilding Ireland on it?  If I was Minister for Finance, I would grab as much of the extra corporation tax revenue as I could, and more, and barrel it in a massive council housing programme because at least that exposure would be reduced significantly and we would also be dealing with what is a major macroeconomic and social problem.

To follow on from the last point about broadening the tax base, does the council see carbon taxes of one kind or another coming to the rescue?  The D&aacute;il has adopted the Oireachtas committee's report on climate change and declared a climate emergency.  Last year some Deputies urged the Minister for Finance to start equalising the excise duties on diesel and petrol, something that would have brought in more revenue.  Does the council agree that some of the taxation increases that will inevitably result from our efforts to meet our decarbonisation targets will fulfil some of the requirement to broaden the tax base?  Does it have a view on how we can protect more vulnerable citizens in the context of an increase in carbon taxes?  The leader of the Green Party has been talking about the green new deal, but many of us in this House are concerned about vulnerable households and fuel poverty.<\/p><p>Would the witnesses agree, for example, with a tax and dividend approach, where the dividend would go back to each household or citizen?  That is the first point on carbon taxation.<\/p><p> Why does the IFAC still include the debt ratio among its four major approaches to the future, given that on page 98 it is stated that the coupon bonds have largely been refinanced, but after 2021 there may be some bonds with which we might have difficulty?  Do we still need to worry so much about debt ratios?<\/p><p> The witnesses might have noticed that a very important drug for a very small number of patients, Spinraza, finally received approval.  Most of the Deputies in the room campaigned for it to become available.  We heard an indicative cost of &euro;20 million per annum.

We have a new chief executive in the HSE, formerly of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who seems to want to relentlessly and ruthlessly control expenditure.

These forecasts should be based on a realistic assessment of what is driving health spending.  That is partly population ageing but it is also things like the new drugs.  One of the problems at the moment is that there does not seem to be a realistic baseline and that people do not stick to it.  Having a more medium-term approach would be very helpful.  For example, the UK has, for the first time, a long-term, five-year plan which envisages quite rapid rises in health spending but those increases are more or less in line with the historical experience of recent years.  In principle, therefore, they should provide the headroom to deal, for example, with new drugs, an ageing population, the increasingly complex mix of pathologies and other issues.

I referred the report to the committee for its consideration in light of the its findings in respect of the impact of residential property price movements on LPT liabilities under a number of scenarios.  As the committee is aware, I have deferred the next valuation date for LPT liabilities from 1 November 2019 to 1 November 2020 by order under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 with a view to providing time and space within which to engage with the committee and hear its views on the appropriate way forward for the LPT.<\/p><p> In 2015, Dr. Don Thornhill conducted a review of the LPT and made recommendations regarding, in particular, any impacts on LPT liabilities due to property price developments.  On foot of Dr. Thornhill's report, the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, proposed to the Government that the revaluation date for the LPT would be postponed from 1 November 2016 to 1 November 2019.  The postponement meant that homeowners continued to have their homes valued for LPT purposes on the basis of their 1 May 2013 declared valuation and so were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 and 2018 as a result of increased property values.  LPT liabilities for 2019 are based on the 2013 declared valuations.  Absent any change in the LPT legislation, the valuation of properties on 1 November 2019 would have been the basis for calculating LPT liabilities in 2020 and beyond.  In that regard, the LPT review indicates that the impact of such a no-policy change would mean, for example, that 27% of residential property owners would see an increase of between &euro;101 and &euro;200, 28% would experience increases between &euro;201 and &euro;300 and 30% would see higher increases.<\/p><p> I initiated a further review of the LPT in 2018, as I considered it was important that the Government was able to make its position clear regarding LPT so that households would be aware of plans for the tax well in advance of the November 2019 revaluation date and the associated LPT liabilities for 2020 and beyond.  I also considered that it was essential that the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT, that is, achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer terms, would inform the deliberations on this matter.  By \"relative stability\" in LPT liabilities I mean that any increases should be modest and affordable and, of course, fair.<\/p><p> The review examined the impact of house price movements under a series of scenarios involving different rate and tax band structures.  However, against a background of significant but geographically uneven increases in residential property price levels, I am of the view that it is necessary to engage in further consultation to identify a scenario that would deliver on the condition I set that there should be relative stability for all taxpayers in their LPT liabilities and that any increases should be modest and affordable.  The review group found that the key challenge in its analysis is the significant variation of property price increases geographically, which introduced significant complexity to the task of attaining moderate and affordable adjustments to the tax in an even manner across the country.<\/p><p> I am also conscious of the importance of maintaining simplicity in the operation of the LPT, which was a major success factor in its introduction.  Details of the scenario analyses are set out in the report.  For the purposes of the review, the review group targeted a broad yield of &euro;500 million, a modest increase on the 2018 yield of &euro;482 million and recent years, and on that basis the group considered five different approaches to the calculation of LPT liabilities.  The first was a central rate.  The second was targeting individual local authority yields equal to the expected 2018 yield without the local adjustment factor.  The third was differing rates for each valuation band.  The fourth was increasing the valuation band thresholds.  I note the review group finding that all of the scenarios involve \"winners\", that is taxpayers who would see their LPT liability reduced, and \"losers\", whose liabilities would increase.  Moreover, the increases and decreases would be different in each scenario.<\/p><p> The review considered other relevant issues including 100% retention of LPT yields by local authorities, continued flexibility on the local adjustment factor and the need to ensure that adequate funding is available for local authorities.  The introduction of LPT addressed three challenges: broadening of the tax base; the provision of a stable funding base; and the strengthening of democracy at a local level.<\/p><p> International experience has shown that property taxes are a secure and stable source of funding, compared with transaction-based taxes.  As a measure which is a tax on assets, not employment, the LPT should not adversely affect growth and job creation.<\/p><p>I consider that the LPT has the potential to play a more significant part in the overall taxation system.  It is important, therefore, that the future of the tax be secured so as to maintain the possibility of enhancing and enlarging its contribution as a proportion of overall tax revenues and, over time, looking at the possibility of it approaching a European norm.  At just 0.6% of national income, the LPT yield is low when compared to rates of 2.8% in France and over 3% in the United Kingdom. <\/p><p> The review included a public consultation process.  It indicated that the committee was against proceeding with automatic revaluations in 2019 as provided for in current legislation, as they would result in significant increases.  I note that the committee supports revaluation with an adjustment to rates nationally to maintain LPT yield or revaluation with an adjustment to rates locally to maintain LPT yield.  The committee also recommended the cessation of exemptions for new and unused properties on equity grounds and because it would broaden the tax base.  The deferral of revaluation until November 2020 provides time and space for the committee to consider the report on the interdepartmental review and provide its views for me.  I hope this session will facilitate that exchange of views. <\/p><p> In my engagement with the committee I am seeking to promote the policy objectives that I consider should underpin any change to the tax.  They are protection of the overall yield; modest and affordable increases, if they occur, in LPT liabilities; integration of new properties into the LPT base; maintenance of the tax base with a small number of exemptions; and upholding the progressivity of the tax.  I have stated my view publicly that reform of the LPT needs to be based on a model of band widening combined with rate changes.  It is, however, challenging to come up with a model where no one faces an increase in their LPT liability.  I support retention of the option for local authorities to reduce the LPT rate in their area and have indicated my willingness to engage with the committee on the issue of taxpayers whose property is located in a managed estate on which the owner of the property is liable to the payment of management fees.  In order to bring this matter forward, we will need legislation to be enacted by March 2020.  Amendments to the LPT legislation are separate from the Finance Bill process as they involve local rather than national taxation.  Therefore, it will be necessary for me to be in a position to present a scheme of a Bill in January next year. <\/p><p> I know that there are diverse views among committee members on the LPT, including the view that it should be abolished.  Nevertheless, I hope we can have a constructive engagement and work towards achieving consensus on the future direction of the LPT, as I firmly believe there is latent potential for the tax to play a positive role in the overall taxation system.  In view of the timeline I have outlined, I would appreciate receiving the considered views of the committee before the end of the current session.  I thank committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#DD00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We have seen very different rates of price changes by county across the country.  Even within counties, we have seen very uneven rates of price increases.  This is the key point.  The uneven degree of price inflation by county and within counties has made it very difficult to come up with a model in which we can ensure there is nobody who does not face a change.

Given the review that is under way and the fact that, at some point, the Minister will have to make decisions on all these matters, will he consider abolishing the LPT at this time?  When it was introduced, the Government said it would provide more funding for local services.  It has not done so.  We were told it would help to dampen the type of property madness we saw prior to 2008.  It clearly has not achieved that objective.  In addition, it has proved in its operation not to be fair in the way the Government suggested it would be.  Increases in the tax have been deferred several times and the Minister does not know quite what to do in that regard.  We are left with a situation where the Government is having to look at all sorts of convolutions to reconfigure it.  Is not all of this proof that the tax was fundamentally flawed from the beginning and was always going to be unfair?<\/p> <p>  The basic problem is that the payment was linked to property prices, something over which householders have absolutely no control, and which have, in the intervening period, gone out of control.  It represents an additional payment for something people have paid for already and, moreover, ability to pay - that is, the income coming into the household - is not taken into account at all.  All these chickens have come home to roost and the Minister is left in the dilemma of what to do.  Without being too political about it, it is surely fair for those of us who opposed the tax from the beginning to say that this dilemma is good reason to reconsider its whole merit.  Our view is that it is a fundamentally flawed tax.  The Minister must finally deal with the problems arising out of the linkage between the tax and property values, which are going through the roof.  If we go ahead with the tax as originally envisaged, those increased property prices will see huge increases in payments due.  Even after any changes the Minister might introduce, the problem of the linkage with property values remains at the heart of the issue.  Will the Minister now consider that the problem is, in fact, the property market?  Will he take on board the other matters we have been highlighting all along?<\/p><p>Rather than put an unfair tax on the family home, will he review things like wealth taxes, particularly in the context of the enormous wealth generated by those who are speculating on property?  A reconfigured property tax might be redirected away from ordinary homeowners towards those who are profiteering from the property sector, driving it out of control and doing immense damage at several levels to society, including to the people who are trying to put an affordable roof over their head.

Ireland is one of the few countries in the world that, prior to the introduction of the LPT, had no property-related form of tax.  We see from what has happened with property taxes elsewhere that the first point of revaluation is the most challenging because it normally comes after a period of property price growth, which is what we are facing.<\/p> <p>  On the question of how we tax people who might be profiting from property development, that was the basis of our decision to increase stamp duty on commercial property.

The challenge of doing that and doing it fairly is immense.

The Minister faces a very difficult task in making this an equitable tax so that citizens see a return for what they pay.  I agree with Deputy McGrath's assessment; it does not really make sense for local authorities to take in the same amount if there is going to be an increase in LPT for 80% of taxpayers and only 20% will see a reduction.  I would like to see the methodology behind that.  It does not seem to make much sense.<\/p><p>Consider the example of somebody in County Mayo who has a three-bed semi-detached property valued at &euro;130,000 or even less.  He or she should be paying considerably less property tax than somebody living in a very affluent part of Dublin like Killiney or Howth, where the level of public services is very different.  In rural parts of Ireland there are really no transport services.  Far fewer services are available.  We must address the feeling among citizens that they do not get anything back for the LPT, that it just goes into the State coffers and is spent on things like overruns on the national children's hospital or the national broadband plan.  Citizens have not seen any tangible difference in the provision of local services since the LPT was introduced.  I would like to hear the MInister's views on this.  Some local authorities are extremely cash-strapped, if I can use that term.  They run on deficits and struggle to provide basic services.  Other local authorities have additional moneys and can provide lots of local services.  The variation between the services local authorities can provide and the resources available to them is so wide.  The Minister would need to address that issue to get support for changes to the LPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#MM01100","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point.  We need to look at how to strengthen the link between the local property tax somebody pays and the local services he or she receives.  That is a fair point.  To make the Deputy aware I will refer to how the LPT is currently allocated.  Of the approximately &euro;500 million raised each year, approximately &euro;400 million is recycled back to local authorities to provide services.  Some &euro;100 million is retained centrally.  I would like to find a way to ensure that more of the tax raised within a particular area stays within that area.  The flip side of that is the need to ensure other local authorities do not lose out as a result.  We have to ensure that a local authority that currently receives funds from elsewhere is not penalised as a result of that policy decision.  In parallel with bringing in the legislation we must make progress in dealing with that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about the contrast between a property in Mayo and a property in a very affluent part of Dublin.  As the Deputy knows, it is likely though not certain that the owner of the property in Mayo will pay less LPT because of the lower property value.  This debate cuts into the heart of issues I will have to deal with when I present the legislation to the House.  Because property prices have grown at different levels in different parts of the country, any reform will have distributional consequences.  Some people will benefit and others will not.  My overall point is that made by Deputies Chambers and Breathnach.  As part of changing this I would like to build the link between what property owners pay and what is retained and spent in their areas.  We can do that.  We will have to do it for some local authorities in order to ensure a successful revaluation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#NN00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I want to be clear that someone who has seen a significant rise in the value of his or her property in an affluent part of the country may not have access to liquid cash to pay extra bills.  He or she may be in a very difficult situation.  Ability to pay has to be a factor regardless of the fact that some people happen to have seen a massive increase in their property values.  The Minister notes that 20% of local property tax is centralised.  Is this something the Government should reconsider?  It is not very genuine to call it a local property tax if 20% goes back to the Central Fund to be spent wherever the Government decides.<\/p><p>In a local authority such as Mayo, elected members do not really have the ability to vary the LPT 15% up or down because if there is a gap left - if they vary it downwards - that gap will not be filled by central Government.  A local authority with extra resources that is doing very well, is in surplus and has extra funds is better able to give back to its citizens.  Such a local authority can vary its LPT and see no negative impact on the provision of services but in a less wealthy area of the country such as parts of rural Ireland, there is no ability to vary the LPT because a hole will be left in the local authority's finances.  These are probably the same local authorities that are already cash strapped.  I have seen nothing in what is proposed by the Minister that seeks to address that significant imbalance across the regions, particularly in parts of rural Ireland where the provision of services is far less than people would receive in other parts of the country.  The message I get back loud and clear is that the LPT is not a fair tax, that it does not stay local and that people have not seen an improvement in their local services.  The Government will consistently get push back until those issues are addressed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#NN00300","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The Deputy argued that we need to give consideration to ability to pay in terms of the future LPT.  I can understand the attraction of that point and why the Deputy feels that way.  Legislating for that and changing the LPT to do that would have massive consequences in terms of what this tax would look like in the future and the revenue it could raise.  This is one of the issues we need to be careful about as we look at changing the revaluation and the legislation we need to make that happen.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's second point about the effect on local authorities that cut their LPT rate, what the Deputy said is correct.  If they cut the rate and there is a gap in revenues as a result, that gap is not filled.  Conversely, were we to decide that we would fill that gap, we could perversely create an incentive for the rate to be reduced even further.  That is why I believe there is merit in ensuring that in the future, if local authorities decide to cut their LPT rate, they can only do so if they feel they have the resources in place to ensure that it is affordable for them.  <\/p> <p>  However, overall, the point made by the Deputy regarding the connection between paying a tax locally and seeing a local service improve is a fair one.  I issued a press statement on the day because it was only touched on in this report because the report looked at how we raise the tax as opposed to how we spend it.  That is something on which we need to make progress.  To get a sense of the figures against that, we retain around &euro;100 million per year in this tax so making progress towards that objective of what is paid locally being used to pay for a local service without penalising another local authority elsewhere does have significant financial consequences.  Over time, we will be able to do a better job on it than we are doing at the moment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#OO00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Are we sticking to the LPT or can we range wider?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#OO00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>There is very little-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#OO00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>  There is very little time.

There is significant frustration that a local authority tax was introduced and that on one hand, a local authority was given the powers to raise this tax and on the other, Exchequer funding of equal amounts was taken from the same local authorities.

At this point, the way in which we will do it will be by a combination of band widening and rate adjustment nationally.

Before the Minister makes any determination on his options, these models should be provided for the committee in order that we would know who the winners and losers were, who would benefit and lose from a local authority's point of view.  It is also important that the Minister outline what his position is on the retention of 100% of the proceeds and getting rid of the equalisation fund.  Is he 100% committed to making sure the figure of 20% of the equalisation fund which is shared with local authorities in more rural and disadvantaged areas will be maintained in the context of Exchequer expenditure?<\/p> <p>  On the report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, it was highly critical of the budgetary stance taken.  There is a table, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar, which shows the mid-term projections which the council has stated for the second time in a row are unrealistic and not credible.  It has again questioned the fact that the Government is not budgeting for the likes of the Christmas bonus.  It has also pointed to health budget overruns, an issue the committee has discussed.  There are indications that we will again see significant overruns.<\/p> <p>  Probably one of the biggest points that sticks out is that the Department and the Minister have not recognised the impact of our dependence on corporation tax in the previous document released by the Department.  It shows that the impact is not as high but that the risk is high.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has questioned this.  Given that the level of concentration is now more severe, at 48% of all tax revenue, according to the TEN Group of Companies, the fact that it is surging and that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is stating up to &euro;3 billion to &euro;6 billion may not be available in the medium term, is it time to look at the advice of the council on medium-term expenditure and give credible figures to the committee, the Oireachtas and the public?  Is it time to look at having a policy on surges and increases in corporation tax?<\/p> <p>  The Minister may also be aware of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's questioning of the design of the rainy day fund which at this point is counter-cyclical but which is not counter-cyclical in a downturn because it runs contrary to fiscal rules to use it for social protection payments or investment in health or education supports and so on because it is limited in the ways it can be used?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#QQ00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I will deal with the four points made by the Deputy.

If we were to outline now what we believe increases in public pay will be in 2021, 2022 and 2023, it would have a fundamental effect on those figures by the time we got to agree them with leaders of the trade unions, with whom we negotiate those increases.  If I were to indicate now what social welfare packages will be in 2022 or 2023, that would have a big effect on the policy decision made by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the day.  Where I differ with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's analysis is that I believe that if we were to go down the path of current expenditure modelling, it would, by and large, eliminate policy discretion for the Government of the day in respect of where funding would be allocated between different Departments.  We should relinquish that discretion with care.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's point on corporation tax, other documents published by my Department have acknowledged that the concentration risk definitely applies to corporation tax in that a smaller number of companies are paying a large share of that total tax head at the moment.

This was also the reason we calculated our tax figures for this year on the basis of collecting a lower level of corporation tax than we collected last year.

The Minister cannot argue that this situation should continue indefinitely.  I understand a case involving a new build where a fresh mortgage has been taken on.  In that case, an exemption for two years might be justified perhaps as the people concerned set themselves up.  It is really hard, however, for people to understand this growing band of exemptions.

Since the last soft landing, if we want to call it that, we have had the introduction of EU fiscal rules and departmental expenditure ceilings.  They are not complementary to the present scenario.  We have consistently exceeded departmental ceilings.  The IFAC referred to the breach of the fiscal rules last year and, potentially, again this year.<\/p> <p>  That is quite damning and critical and focuses on a few key areas.  We have spoken briefly about the first one, corporation tax receipts, and the Minister has given his response.  I take the point made by the Minister.  He has allowed for reduced receipts this time around.  That, however, is not to say that the Minister will not use those receipts to bail out Departments, as he has done consistently in the past.  The volatility remains consistent.   What further analysis has been carried out by the Minister and his Department to measure that volatility and to allow a judgment to be made on when it will cease to be such a safety net for the economy?<\/p> <p>  The other issue mentioned was the impact of Brexit and the credibility of the forecasts made by the Minister's Department.  Much depends on the Government assuming that there will be a soft or an arranged Brexit.  It would appear now that it might be quite the opposite.  That might have a major detrimental impact on the economy, its performance and other related aspects of the economy thereafter.  It is unfortunate that element has not been factored into the forecasts.  That may be why the representatives from the IFAC stated that some of the forecasts are not realistic, not credible and not responsible.<\/p><p> I will move on to another point I raised with the representatives of Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, concerning the national development plan.  We have overruns in two areas of it already.  One is with the national children's hospital where in excess of another &euro;350 million has to be provided for in the next three to four years and we have no information yet as to from where that will come.  Also, in excess of &euro;1.5 billion has to be provided for the national development plan up to 2027 and another &euro;400 million has to be provided between 2019 and 2023.  That is the guts of &euro;3 billion that the Minister has said will come from future revenues.  The representatives of IFAC have said, and I agree with them, that is not necessarily credible.  It is unrealistic, it is not fair and it is not being straight with the electorate.  The Minister said it will not result in any other projects being forgone, that there will be no effect on any other single project in the national development plan across the areas of health, housing, education and so forth.  I contend the money to pay for this has to come from higher taxes, new borrowings, current expenditure, cuts or projects forgone in the national development plan.  Those are the four options available to the Minister but he has said \"No\" to those.  However, they and I have said it is not credible to say that is the case.  How does the Minister respond to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#TT01800","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Regarding the different points the Deputy made, first, he alleged I have breached the fiscal rules in the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#UU00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I do not, they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#UU00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>No, I think the Deputy said I had breached the fiscal rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#UU00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>And they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#UU00500","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Each budget I have introduced has been assessed by the European Commission as being compliant with our fiscal rules.

There is a similar sense currently with it comes to our treatment of land.  It is quite retro.  Developers have full page advertisements in newspapers telling us what is good for us in the form of development.  Fine Gael is relying almost entirely on the market to solve our housing problems, which, clearly, is not working.  It is giving everything to developers in terms of lower standards and so on and developers are storing land again and playing the housing issue for their own interests.  <\/p> <p>  As part of the wider consideration of property tax, will the Minister consider reintroducing the tax that we introduced in government, which put an 80% tax on any rezoning profits that would accrue to a landowner who would benefit from that land being rezoned in any way?  The previous Government pulled that measure arguing it never raised any revenues and therefore why would we have it.  However, it is an important check against improper speculative gains from land hoarding.  With the commencement of new development plans in the councils, it would be completely improper for any of the benefits of that to accrue to developers.  It might put some manners on the developers if they were not to see it as a speculative asset that is worth hoarding.<\/p> <p>  Second, will the Minister give the Land Development Agency compulsory purchase order powers, or consider giving it stronger powers in that respect?  We need to build up bands to achieve the objectives of the national planning framework, with which I agree.  The national development plan abandoned it - it is totally unsustainable - but the regional planning framework was very good.  It is desirable to bring life back to the centre.<\/p><p>For example, in Dublin city, the Land Development Agency might look at making compulsory purchase orders in respect of brownfield or industrial estate lands.  It could be effective to develop such lands in conjunction with other State assets.  Will the Land Development Agency be given powers to make compulsory purchase orders and, if so, will it be possible to ensure that this will not just result in massive benefits or profits for landowners?  The latter should not necessarily benefit as a result of compulsory purchase orders being made, any profit should accrue to the State.  Is the Minister considering giving the Land Development Agency powers in this regard?<\/p><p> I have views on domestic property tax, which we tend to focus on and then miss the bigger picture.  Not taxing the capital asset of land that is hoarded by speculators and not released onto the market is the core problem when it comes to housing.  Is the Minister examining the possibility of strengthening the State's ability to recoup benefits that accrue from developments like the metro through the use of site levies and other mechanisms?  Is the Minister looking at this as a third mechanism to even up the score and ensure that we do not just end up with a developer-led system but, rather, but a property management system designed to uphold the public good?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#VV00600","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s assessment of where we stand from  IFAC's point of view, will he give consideration to changes we have made in broadening the tax base to deal with the very risk he identified?  Over the past two budgets, the tax base has been broadened.  This was done despite the fact the sectors of our economy affected by tax broadening did not want it.  It happened precisely because I am trying to find ways of ensuring that, over time, we do not become excessively reliant on a particular tax head.  The Deputy knows what they are and he knows what we have done with stamp duty on commercial property, with VAT and with the gambling sector, which was on a smaller level.<\/p> <p>  Giving additional powers to the Land Development Agency is a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, although I am working with him on it.  My view is that the Land Development Agency should have strong powers to use compulsory purchase orders because it is important for allowing it to build up a landbank which, of itself, is value for building homes on.  It will also have an important indirect effect then on the pricing of other land adjacent to those landbanks.<\/p> <p>  I am not planning to introduce an additional zoning tax.  The reason for this is that I am trying to increase the supply of zoned land.  My concern is that if I was to make such a change, it could run against that objective.  It is not the case that we are reliant on the market to deliver the objectives we have for housing.  We need private developers to deliver private homes to those who want to buy them.  However, between one and four and one and five of the homes built this year will be delivered through different mechanisms by the State for social and public use.  That is mixed used.  At this point, I am not considering introducing development levies on rezoning decisions.  I am engaging with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure we are funding infrastructure in the right way while ensuring nobody is benefiting disproportionately from the delivery of a public good in their vicinity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#WW00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Let us take the example of agricultural land valued at &euro;10,000 an acre.

The Minister is correct that the position is changing by the hour.  Seamus Coffey and his team were present for the earlier part of the meeting.  Their report indicates that a significant fiscal adjustment will be required, along with significant spending cuts or tax increases to stop Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio from spiralling in the event of hard Brexit.  I asked Mr. Coffey what level of adjustment would be required in such an event.  His response was it would be a &euro;4 billion adjustment in one year and that it could be broadened out to &euro;5 billion over a three-year period.  Has the Minister done any planning in respect of how he might cope with such a significant adjustment to the public finances in the space of 12 months?  Has the Department done anything to address the impact of the fluctuations in the value of sterling?  Even today, the exchange rate is nearly 90 p to &euro;1 and this is already having an impact on businesses.  There was an assumption that it might fall back to 85 p to &euro;1.<\/p> <p>  The secretariat provided a table, based on the IFAC report, on the baseline scenario for the budget balance compared with the ESRI and the Central Bank projections.  The latter two vary.  The Central Bank forecasts for a hard Brexit are far more miserable but the ESRI forecast is just as distressing.<\/p><p>It shows that in the event of a hard Brexit, instead of having a surplus of 0.6% of GNI we could be looking at a deficit of -4.7%, according to the Central Bank or -0.2.3%, according to the ESRI.  If we track forward to 2022 and 2023, it is the same level of forecasting in that we had hoped for a surplus in those years, on the baseline scenario, but we are looking at a deficit now of at best -0.4% and, at worst, -2.8%.  The Minister identified 2022 and 2023 as the years in which the most significant spending on the national broadband plan will be required.  If there is a hard Brexit, it would make that level of spending for that particular capital investment almost impossible.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019061100002#XX01000","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>In the context of the Deputy's point on the short and medium-term effects of Brexit on the national finances, I published an estimate of that earlier in the year and indicated that the effect would be significant.  I also indicated that it would mean that the surpluses we have begun to run - and which would have run at a higher pace in the future - would be affected considerably and that the national finances would move back into deficit.  I will outline our views on what this will mean in the context of our ability to make choices in the future because I want everybody to be aware of that.  As to how we would then need to think about parts of the economy that require support, the position regarding Brexit is changing and we need to be aware of that in the context of what it might mean for us later in the year as the various debates in the British political system take place.  If we get into a hard-Brexit scenario, it  will mean that the Government will need to put in place supports for different parts of the economy and then pay for these.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about the national broadband plan, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that because I am only at the point where I will be outlining resources that may or may not be available.  I will say two things to the Deputy that will be up for debate throughout the year: first, if we do get into a hard-Brexit scenario, the parts of our country that could be most affected are also those that would rely most on broadband connectivity in the future; and, second, for those who believe that there is a cheaper or different way to do this, they will have to outline what that is at some point because I went through that process for the best part of a year in terms of trying to identify such a way.

What work has been done in terms of the yield and in looking at the scenarios relating to a property price crash and the protection of the yield from the LPT?  In looking at a funding model for local government, how would we deal with that if there were a recurrence of what happened between 2008 and 2010?  I do not know an analysis has been done in this regard but it would certainly be important in the context of the committee's work.<\/p> <p>  The Minister made reference to a willingness to look at the situation relating to managed estates and management fees.

There is a notion that the snow can be cleared or the footpaths repaired only once and that various things are done by a council at one particular point.

What is the Minister's thinking on the idea that most property tax, if it is kept and spent locally, will be spent for the greater good of the community?  If somebody living in an apartment worth &euro;700,000 is paying X amount in property tax and a management fee, he or she is getting the benefit of the management fee through the preservation of the immediate vicinity.  Somebody living in a house worth &euro;700,000 in a large housing estate will pay a large amount in property tax but might also be paying fees to a residents' association or whatever.

I will cover the policy implications of the People Before Profit Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018, the steps the Government is taking following on from the recent all-party climate report and the declaration of a climate emergency.  I will then remark on the financial implications of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  As part of its role in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, Ireland has a target of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  All credible models, such as those contained in the work done by the International Energy Agency, IEA, the European Commission and University College Cork, UCC, show that in meeting the Paris objectives there will still be a need for some oil and, particularly, gas out to 2050.  As a Government, we must plan for how we are going to source that energy for our citizens.  If we know and accept that we need some oil and gas during the transition to a low-carbon economy, then there are several clear benefits of using indigenous sources over imported sources.  There will be a less harmful impact on the environment, as energy does not have to be moved over long distances.  The State will get a tax return, which can be up to 55% in the case of the most recent licensing terms.  There can also be energy security benefits in using the Kinsale and Corrib gas fields.  The tax income accrued from indigenous sources could be re-invested in the energy transition by helping with the extensive capital investments we must put towards renewable energy and energy efficiency.  That is particularly the case regarding our heating and transport systems.<\/p> <p>  Regarding energy security, Europe accounts for approximately 15% of the world&rsquo;s demand for oil and gas.  In respect of the world&rsquo;s proven energy reserves, however, Europe, including Norway, accounts for less than 1% of oil and approximately 3% of natural gas reserves.  On the other hand, the Middle East and Russia hold over 70% of proven gas reserves.  In essence, this Bill will not keep fossil fuels in the ground; it will mean they are taken out of the ground a long way from Ireland, with all the known disadvantages of doing so.<\/p> <p>  Turning to action being taken by the Government, a number of steps have already been embarked upon.  The all-of-Government climate plan, which will shortly be finalised, will set out how this Government intends to make Ireland climate resilient across our entire society.  This will involve setting climate goals in all key sectors, including electricity, agriculture, transport, industry, buildings, waste and the public sector.  The plan will lead to a significant step-up in policy ambition and delivery to ensure that we at least meet our 2030 targets and get on a clear pathway to meeting our 2050 objectives.  It is clear that the development of offshore wind can be a game-changer in helping Ireland reach its ambitious target of 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  This must be the focus of our efforts and doing so will put us in a position to take steps such as that proposed in this Bill.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the specific financial implications, as committee members are no doubt aware, the Ceann Comhairle has determined that a money message is required for this Bill to progress.  The background to this position is that on 31 October 2018 the Oireachtas Library and Research Service reported a direct Exchequer cost estimate of between &euro;8 million and &euro;50 million.  On 26 November 2018, I expressed my concerns regarding the financial implications of this Bill in a letter to this committee ahead of its meeting to consider a scrutiny report.  I then wrote to the Ceann Comhairle on 8 May 2019 to detail my concerns regarding the financial implications of the Bill and requested further consideration of a money message.<\/p> <p>  The costs set out in my letter included those that are immediately quantifiable, such as the refund of application and licensing fees.  Financial implications would also be incurred if this Bill were to be passed because it would be necessary to prepare for a likely legal challenge from existing licence holders.  Other financial implications, which are difficult to assess at this point, include likely compensation to be paid to licence holders.  Also to be taken into consideration is the lost potential revenue to the State in the form of direct tax revenue.  That lost potential revenue could be used to fund the energy transition and taxes arising from economic activity associated with this development.<\/p> <p>  If there is an impact on the Exchequer, then I am bound to make that known.  I also note that since this Bill was introduced, we have new protocols in place that give helpful clarity to all concerned on these processes in future.  The Government has indicated that it is opposed to this Bill.  It does not reduce Ireland&rsquo;s emission, it does not encourage renewable energy and it makes Ireland more dependent on energy imports.  It will also oblige us to import all our needs at a time when the Kinsale gas field will soon close and the Corrib field is declining.

We have had three opportunities to have lengthy debates on this Bill.  I find it insulting, as well as shocking, that he is raising these concerns now.  I do not take it personally.  It is insulting, however, to the thousands of children who went on strike and the movement that organises and mobilises daily to try to get this Government to do something meaningful to deal with the global corporations that inflict the greatest damage on the planet.  That is why we want to see fossil fuels left in the ground.  I reiterate that the science is settled on the fact that 80% of known fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground.<\/p> <p>  What does the Minister of State think that other countries should do with their reserves of fossil fuels?  If we are not going to import fossil fuels from those countries, and they are also going to transition towards using renewable energy, does the Minister of State then believe those countries should leave their fossil fuels in the ground but we should not?  Will he explain why he thinks that this is an Irish rather than a global issue?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the seven applications for licences that are on hand, when were those made?  If any decisions have been made on those applications by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, when did that happen?  I want to tease out how and why the fees these companies paid have to be returned and how that constitutes an appropriation of public money.  My view is that those applicants paid fees and now we have to give them back.  That is not an appropriation of public moneys.  We are returning fees that were already given to the State.  It would have a net zero impact on the public purse.  <\/p> <p>  Moving to the repayment of the acreage rental fees, does that figure apply to all existing licences?  Does it include the three licences that cover the existing four operating sites?  Why does the Department think that it must return these fees?  This Bill does not stop the holders of existing licences from continuing to explore.  It simply stops the issue of any further licences once carbon in the atmosphere is above 350 parts per million.  What, if anything, does a climate emergency mean if it is not that we have to take cognisance of the level of CO2 in the atmosphere?  Does that not constitute the basis of an emergency?  We have just declared such an emergency in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I remind the Minister of State of that fact.  <\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we called this the Petroleum and Other Minerals (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 was not because we had the foresight to know that the D&aacute;il would declare a climate emergency some 18 months after the Bill was introduced.  We included \"(Climate Emergency Measures)\" in the title because we were aware of what happened when the financial crash occurred.  Overnight, the Government was on that occasion able to construct financial emergency measures and take pay and pensions, and all sorts of other conditions, away from workers in the public sector.<\/p><p>Many of those punitive measures still exist.  We do not seem able to take measures in a climate emergency to deal with fossil fuel corporations, for example, companies like Exxon or the Chinese state corporation, which was actually given a licence by the Minister of State a couple of days after the climate emergency was declared to explore for gas and oil off the Kerry coast.  The Minister of State has to explain that contradiction, namely, why the Government can deal with one emergency in one way and another emergency in another.  If the Government declared a climate emergency, does that not give it a right to be able to deal with the licences that exist?<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State talked about an automatic right of progression between licences.  We have to challenge that.  In the 2007 terms, the criteria for an authorisation are as follows:<\/p><blockquote>\t[H]aving regard to the authorisation applied for:<br \/><br \/>(a) the work programme proposed by the applicant;<br \/><br \/>(b) the technical competence and offshore experience of the applicant;<br \/><br \/>(c) the financial resources available to the applicant;<br \/><br \/>(d) the applicant&rsquo;s policy to health, safety and the environment... <\/blockquote><p>Part (d) is the important one, given it concerns the policy of the fossil fuel industry towards health and safety and the environment we live in.  If burning fossil fuels is not already proven to be very damaging to the environment and to the health and safety of everybody on the planet, why would the Minister of State believe he had to give a continuing licence and to move on to the next step?  Is that not enough for him to be able to say he is sorry but the company is not entitled to the next step because its policy in regard to the health and safety of the planet is not good enough?<br\/><br\/>I am sorry for taking so much time.  I will finish shortly.  In regard to the lease undertakings, the 2007 terms state: &quot;In the event that the licensee is unable to subsequently confirm as commercial the discovery so notified but is of the opinion that it may become commercial and the Minister concurs...&quot;  If we are told by the IPCC and by the scientists that, within the next 11 or 12 years, we have to seriously start dealing with the level of fossil fuels we are burning, and if a company says to the Minister of State today that it wants to go out and explore for gas or oil which it can prove to him will be commercially viable, what is commercially viable about a product we have been told we have to stop burning?  When it is ready to be burned in 20 years, because it takes that period of time, if we even find it, to extract it, manufacture it and then burn it, is the Minister of State suggesting it will be okay to burn billions of tonnes worth of carbon that have been extracted from the seas off Ireland, and that that will be commercially viable?  If we are moving to renewables and to a situation where fossil fuels become a thing of the past, where is the commercial viability in that?<br\/><br\/>On the petroleum lease, the terms clearly state: &quot;When a Petroleum Lease is applied for under paragraph (1) and the Minister is satisfied by reference to the likely production profile and the applicant's outline development, financial and marketing plans that a commercial discovery has been made, it shall be the duty of the Minister to grant that application.&quot;  I put the question of commercial viability to the Minister of State again.  What is commercially viable about a discovery which in 20 to 25 years time has no place on this planet, given we should not be burning it and should not be using it?<br\/><br\/>We are in a climate emergency yet all of these applicants want to increase the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by extracting more fossil fuels, whether gas or oil, and we know they are frantically engaged in trying to derail this Bill.  We can see from the lobbying register that they are lobbying Senators and Deputies very hard to try to stop this Bill going forward.  They continue to want to search our waters for more sources of carbon that they can burn.  If this is an emergency, would the Minister of State not agree that we have to move from fossil fuels in the next 11 years?  How can this be deemed commercial after a decade or more or, equally, how can it be deemed in the interests of the public or of the environment?  The Minister of State has many ways in which he is able to say the applicants do not have to progress to the next stage because that is what the legislation currently states.  He just chooses to ignore it.<br\/><br\/>These companies have no claim on public money for compensation.  They have no claim on money even to have the fees returned to them because it is explicit in the terms and conditions that Exxon, Providence or any of the companies that apply to the Minister of State have no claim to the future of our schoolchildren or the future of this planet.  They have no right to the global commons in order to pursue their own profits.<br\/><br\/>I wonder whether the Minister of State will be honest with me and come back on these questions in an honest way, instead of trying to use procedural trickery.  The game is up for these companies.  It may not be up in Ireland yet but it will be up eventually.  The Minister of State needs to go back to the drawing board and think very carefully about what he is asking today in terms of arguing for a money message for this Bill.  I would argue, as I said in the D&aacute;il, that given a money message at this level, very little public money would be due to be paid out to these companies.  By comparison to the sort of waste this Government and others engage in, it would be doing not just the people of this country a favour but also a huge favour for the planet and the fight for climate action.  Based on these figures, I find it unbelievable that the Minister of State thinks this Bill should have a money message.  It is unbelievable that it should have it and unacceptable that the Minister of State is bringing it forward at this point in time, when we should be sitting here, discussing how we amend this Bill, how we make it better, who wants to put in what and having a real debate about things like energy security and the future for renewables in this country, instead of this pretend debate, where trickery comes before the genuine concerns of Senators and Deputies about climate action. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#B00900","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I will try to respond as best I can and, as always, honestly.

We will need them and, even if we meet our targets in 2030, which would mean a move from 30% of energy produced through renewables to 70%, we still have a gap of 30% to make up.  Looking out to 2050 and beyond, the important thing is how we manage that.<\/p> <p>  As I have said before, the Deputy's Bill is well-intentioned and it is important we recognise that.

Do we want to get our gas or our oil for the next 20 or 30 years from fracked shale gas, from sources of which we have no knowledge, which would be a lot more damaging to the environment, or do we want a security of supply?

I opposed the Deputy's Bill and remain totally opposed to it for a number of reasons which I want to put on the record and I do not believe that in doing so that I am insulting the environmental movement, the children's initiative or anything of that kind.  I think I am looking after those children and their interests in the long term.  The simple fact, as the Minister of State has stated again and again, and which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith continues to ignore, is that this country is going to remain partially dependent on fossil fuels, or their equivalent, until 2050 at any rate.  We are not going to be able to move 100% to renewables and we are not going to achieve absolute carbon neutral energy production for 30 years from now.<\/p> <p>  The question, which the Minister of State put, is very succinct and it is about where our fossil fuel energy will come from and not whether we are going to use it.  Let us look at the energy requirements of our changing society.  We have a growing population and an increased dependence on electricity.  Electricity can only be generated by renewable sources, such as solar, wind or biofuels of some kind, or, alternatively, by fossil fuels to some extent or by atomic energy.  We cannot produce electricity other than by those means.<\/p> <p>  The next point we have to face up to honestly - Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith constantly refers to the need to be honest - is that if, as the Minister of State's figures prove, western Europe is going to be hugely dependent on imported gas over the next 20 to 30 years, we have to remember that in the event of any major disruption to that supply of fuels from eastern Europe, the Middle East or Russia in particular, we would be the first to suffer, because we are one of the weakest and most peripheral economies.  We would be the people to whom gas rationing would be applied in a way least favourable to ourselves, if there was a question of a threat to the gas supply to German, British, French or the lowlands industry. <\/p> <p>  Let us be honest.  We are closing down Moneypoint in five years' time and we are going to need back-up gas electricity generation capacity for the next 20 years, no matter what way anybody in this room wishes it to be.  The only issue is whether we should say we are going to stop all oil exploration and extraction in Irish waters as a matter of principle, and import everything from somewhere else in the world.  It is not a question of saying that we are going to abandon fossil fuels.<\/p><p>Nor does Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's Bill take into account that in the transformation from fossil fuels to other forms of energy, renewables in particular, the taxation policies of the State will be crucial, whether they are carbon taxes or excise duties.  They are the economic lever whereby we make some forms of energy generation more economical and others less so in accordance with the public good.  I have asked successive delegates before the committee about things like the data centres that are being built which have the potential to increase the demand for electricity by one third at a time when there is supposed to be a climate emergency.  I have never received satisfactory answers.  To me, it is very simple.  We should be utterly honest.  We cannot give up the consumption of fossil fuels unilaterally or in the short to medium term.  If that is the case, we have a simple choice to make.  Will we rely on the goodwill of others if there is a gas shortage in ten, 15 or 20 years, or do we use whatever resources nature has made available to us to avoid that risk?  That is the only issue.  To portray it as a capitulation to multinationals is wrong.<\/p><p> I want to talk about the legal implications.  Under the Constitution property rights are always subject to the common good.  Therefore, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is right in one respect.  If it were the case that there was a climate emergency and it was necessary to abrogate the rights of drillers, developers, explorers and licensees, we could do it if it was done in the interests of the common good.  It would just be too bad for the people who would suffer economically as a consequence.  Property rights are not sacrosanct.<\/p><p> On the money message, I have seen in respect of Palestine and the Occupied Territories the invocation by the Government of the money message method as a way of denying passage to that Bill.  I am strongly of the view that it is legally incorrect.  It involves a misunderstanding of D&aacute;il Standing Order 179(2).  It also involves a misunderstanding of the relationship between Articles 15 and 17 of the Constitution.  If the Government can actually point to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's Bill as having the incidental effect of requiring public funds to be appropriated for a particular purpose, the money message is correct.  If it cannot establish this, that it is tax forgone or something like that is not correct.  <\/p><p> If we are being honest and non-ideological about this, the State needs to keep its energy options open and should not put itself in a position where if Vladimir Putin was to turn off the taps and there was a crisis in the Middle East, we would have no means whatsoever of sustaining the economy that increasingly will be dependent on electricity.  If we are to have electric cars, somebody will have to generate the electricity.  If we are to have an electronic, service economy based on the Internet and the like, it will all require electricity.  If we are to ban back boilers, solid fuel and all of those things, the country will demand more and more electricity.  If we are to have data centres, they will demand even more.  The Bill amounts to a gesture.  I accept what the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has said about it being well intentioned.  However, it involves the serious risk that other countries would, in the event that there is a gas energy crisis in Europe, put us in the position where we would have to beg for our existence on a network of international pipelines.  I agree with the Minister of State.  I cannot for the life of me see that this is not about the amount of gas used in Ireland.  The relative price of renewable and non-renewable energy can be determined by Government policy, including carbon taxes and the like.

The Middle East and Russia hold over 70% of proven gas reserves.  Where would we be if there was to be a crisis?  With Brexit and all that goes with it, for gas we are relying on a pipe running through the United Kingdom.  As well as this, we have to ask what we want to achieve.  The debate is about achieving our targets for 2030 and 2050 in a way that is managed and fair and in order that there will be a transition.  We look at the matter holistically to see how we can achieve this, protect jobs and our supplies.  We talk about energy.  Transport, electric cars and all such infrastructures will have to be part of the transition.  We cannot rely totally on wind energy or energy from the sun.  We have to have backups.  One is to plant a massive number of batteries for the purposes of storage across the country.  We have to face up to what that would be like.

When it was communicated to it a week or two ago, I was somewhat shocked to hear that the issue of the money message had reared its head again, two years after we had been told that one was not required.  The Government is, at best, inconsistent and, at worst, hypocritical.  There are no degrees of emergency.  There is either an emergency or there is not.  If the Government thinks there is no emergency, why is it stating in the D&aacute;il that there is?  Why is it voting on motions to that effect and telling us it that next week it will announce the devil and all in measures and incentives?  We cannot have it both ways.  Either there is an emergency or there is not.  If there is one, why are we even debating this?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to rehash the policy arguments, but I will briefly touch on a few that have been mentioned.  We have had the Second Stage debate.  The whole point in being here is to discuss a technical measure that has been adopted by the Government to block the Bill.  That is the nub of it.  We have had a Second Stage debate in which the Bill was voted on by the D&aacute;il.  It has been voted on by the committee and again by the D&aacute;il when there were attempts to block it by other procedural means.  We have had the policy debates.  At this committee we were looking forward to tabling constructive amendments.  We thought that today or in the near future we would be moving the Bill on further.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State should be aware that Fianna F&aacute;il raised some of his concerns about potential exposure.  We will table amendments to address some of the technical issues and lacunae that may have emerged and some of the risks to which the State might be exposed.  That was already in hand.  For political or other reasons the Government has decided to block the Bill and found a way to do it.  This spanner has been thrown into the works at the last minute.  This affects the credibility of the Government which is stating to consumers that we have to implement a carbon tax.  The same does not apply to the Oireachtas which is more or less on message.  Consumers' behaviour is to be influenced by measures such as the carbon tax.  The Government is stating they should reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, while at the same time telling the producers to keep on burning and drilling.  It seems completely incoherent and hypocritical and very unfair to all involved. <\/p> <p>  Another point I wish to make before addressing the technical points which are the real nub of the discussion concerns the arguments about our need for fossil fuels and future energy security.  How can we begin to make the transition to a renewable energy economy if we do not make a start?  The day we begin to move off something is the day we will start to move to the new thing.  If we are forever making commitments for ten, 20 or 50 years into the future or discussing our energy needs in 2050, at what point will we begin?  When it comes to renewable energy technologies, we need to start the wheel turning on investment, research, education, mindset and companies looking for opportunities.  We need to start the other wheel turning in parallel.  The longer one wheel is kept spinning, the longer it will take the other to start moving.  The green revolution matters to jobs and technology.  There are economic opportunities in engineering and research and development.  Green energy opportunities are considered to be very rich on this island, but we are not going to get there any time soon if we keep trying to milk the old system.<\/p> <p>  There is another point about which I wish to ask the Minister of State.  I will not say I rebut this as he may be able to tell me I am wrong.  This is rehashing Second Stage but I will say it again.  We are being told by the Minister of State at the committee and in other places where this issue is debated that we are exposed to energy security risks.  In the absence of Irish offshore resources we will suddenly be dependent on the goodwill of President Vladimir Putin or Arab sheikhs.  That is a strong argument, but there is no State exploration company.  Ireland Inc. is not drilling or exploring for oil in the Porcupine Basin.  To my knowledge, there is no State exploration vehicle.  Firms such as Exxon and Chinese exploration companies bid for and win licences which they can sell to the highest bidder.  That bidder can then explore reserves and extract and sell products.  Deputy Eamon Ryan alluded to this also.  I have given the Minister of State a good hearing.  There is an energy security argument to be made, although I am not convinced by it.  If he is correct, why is the Government not bringing forward a Bill to ring-fence future finds for the State?  Am I wrong?  Is there already a provision stating Irish offshore exploration licences must be ring-fenced for the economy?  <\/p> <p>  I have other questions, but I will wait for the answers to the ones I have asked before moving on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#G00400","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":417,"content":"<p>We will try to get though them, but I am conscious of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#G00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The Deputy said we should move away from what we are doing first before doing something different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#G00600","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>We should do both at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#G00700","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":420,"content":"<p>We should move away first and that is what we are doing.

Irish Rail and Bus &Eacute;ireann are moving towards electric or battery operated vehicles.  They are moving away from reliance on fossil fuels.  Our target is 70% dependence on renewables by 2030.  That is the plan and what we are moving towards.  However, we have to think about the other 30%.  How will it be kept in play?  How do we secure the supplies of natural gas and fossil fuels on which we will still rely?  We will not be 100% dependent on renewables.  That is the debate.  I have been saying all day that we have to do this in a structured way.  We cannot just finish with one energy source and then start with the other.  We have to make a transition.

There is goodwill.  Senator McDowell was anxious to preface his remarks similarly and his bona fides have to be accepted.  I grew up on a farm in Cavan and anyone who grew up with nature is more than acutely aware of all the issues here and has a feel for them.<\/p> <p>  The all-party report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change makes some recommendations.  The Citizens' Assembly has made recommendations.  There is a consensus emerging that there is a climate change emergency which we need to deal with.  That needed to emerge through the committee, the assembly and public information, and through the actions of young people in recent weeks as a backdrop to any concerted actions because there has to be buy-in or a sense of ownership among the people, to use the clich&eacute;d terms.

With respect to Deputy Smith and others, whose bona fides are very sound, given the recommendations of the committee, the assembly and the student movement, it would be wise to wait for the climate action plan, to have buy-in to it and to make sure that any proposals we make are made in the context of that plan.  We should go for the holistic approach and then everything becomes a subset of that and is open to amendment and discussion.<\/p> <p>  It is not fanciful to bring geopolitics into this.  We do not know what the geopolitical situation will be.  I have the privilege of being a member of the Council of Europe, of which the Minister of State is a former member, and I lead the Irish delegation.  Listening to the people from eastern Europe, it is clear that Russia has taken some arbitrary actions from the Crimea into Ukraine and elsewhere, and there is a palpable fear of that.  There is no reason to be smug or relaxed about it.  There is a risk factor there that we can never forget about.<\/p><p>If, as presented by the Minister and his officials, and as common sense would suggest, we are in transition but we will need supplies of oil and gas for the next 20 to 30 years I do not see the logic in those supplies being sourced from outside of the country.  I genuinely do not understand why we would not seek to source them from within, while working to eliminate them.  The fact that we get a tax return of 55% cannot be ignored.  Should our finances tighten owing to spend on infrastructural projects, health services and so on that 55% tax return could be ring-fenced for use on the climate change agenda in terms of developing green energy and retrofitting etc.  It is better that we have that money and use it rather than forgo it.  It will ensure we do not run out of money in regard to the green agenda.  This has to be a consideration.  <\/p><p> On the point regarding the Minister seeking the Ceann Comhairle's opinion, I would have thought it a perfectly normal exercise for a Minister confronted with a legislative change to check if a money message would be required.  I do not see anything particularly untoward about that.  As I said, I would have thought that to be due process.   As the Chairman pointed out earlier, the Ceann Comhairle's position cannot be contravened or argued with.  Applying a level of common sense or layman's approach to this, it is hardly conceivable that we could halt licensed operations with incurring costs.  Apart from forgoing potential revenue, we would incur costs in terms of compensation.  I take on board Senator McDowell's point that the argument of an emergency could be made, but I think that is a questionable proposition.  I presume those who would be affected have thought that one through.  Senator McDowell is an acknowledged legal expert, one of the finest in this country, but his thesis that given the nature of our Constitution and the place of private property therein we could get away without paying some level of compensation is questionable.  We will need electricity to charge electric vehicle batteries.  An issue constantly raised with me in my constituency and home area is the absence of an infrastructure to support the proposed increased number of electric vehicles on our roads.  This is one of the greatest arguments against that initiative.  How electric vehicles are to be powered into the future is one of the questions that remains unanswered.  <\/p><p> In regard to domestic energy security, I am concerned on a number of levels.  The Minister made the interesting point that as happened in Norway and the UK the intention is to sell the product into the indigenous domestic market, which would make sense in the real world.  I am privileged to have three sons, each of whom is interested in the sciences, which I do not understand, but we have discussed the amazing advances in technology.  The Minister made the valid observation that into the future we may be in a position to decarbonise fossil fuels.  Who knows what science will exist in 20 years?  We should endeavour to retain our supply intact as we build up the green supplies as well.  We should strive to achieve both in parallel.  There have been tremendous scientific advances, including in green technology.  We have to keep abreast of science.  We should all exercise a level of constraint and calm while remaining determined.  I have yet to meet a Member of the Houses who is not committed to the climate change project.  We are a small island and given the nature of our economy we do not have a vested interest, nor should we, in doing anything else.  <\/p><p> We should await the climate action plan and proceed according to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#H02500","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>On the question regarding the financial implications of the Bill, neither the Minister nor the Department had any input into the original money message decision.

What has happened is very regrettable.  The Bill was well advanced when it was grinded to a halt by a money message.  I listened carefully to what Senator Joe O'Reilly had to say.  He mentioned that in 20 years we might have technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels such that we could continue to burn them.  If we are serious about this, we do not have 20 years.  We are already 20 years behind.  What happened is disheartening in light of all the blarney about new politics and the Oireachtas working together and playing a greater role.  The number of Bills ground to a halt in this way over the last couple of years is staggering.  Since 2017, eight Sinn F&eacute;in Bills dealing with climate change matters have been introduced.   The Waste Reduction (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017, which is the only Bill that sets out in a comprehensive way how to reduce waste, is stalled.  The Local Authority Climate Obligation Bill 2018 is being bounded around at various levels of bureaucracy.  The Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 is progressing at a snail's pace.  The Wind Turbine Regulation Bill 2016 seeks to put in place regulations that would allow the harnessing of wind in a sensible way, which we need to do.  The absence of all of this legislation is allowing multinational companies to inappropriately locate and operate in areas with no benefit to local communities.  We should be regulating for the appropriate location of wind turbines to the benefit of local communities.  In doing so, we could reap much better rewards in terms of renewable energy.  The Bills I have mentioned are four of the eight Bills introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p> <p>  The Bill before us, introduced by Solidarity-People Before Profit, is likewise being stalled.  I have outlined from the outset that there are parts of the Bill that we would seek to amend but the thrust of it is in the right direction.  We need to progress this legislation.  What has happened at such an advanced stage is very regrettable.  I do not know whether this was the dead hand of Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or other influences being brought to bear.<\/p><p>I mean that in terms of - pardon the pun - a climate being created by stopping all such measures and legislation.  We cannot amend legislation and allow this to go through.  I read about the exchange of correspondence between the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle.  On any reading, the Minister is clutching at straws in trying to stop the Bill from being moved forward.  How many times were the Department and its officials lobbied by oil and gas companies or their representatives in 2018 and to date in 2019?  How many times have officials of the Department met representatives of oil and gas exploration companies in 2018 and to date in 2019?

I have only used the Minister of State's argument with him.  He says that by 2030, we will have 70% of our energy from renewables.  Where does the other 30% come from?  At present, we import 50% of our gas needs.  If, by 2030, we only have to import 30%, is that not an improvement?  Here comes the geopolitical argument.  I have heard what Senators McDowell and O'Reilly said, what the Minister of State intimated, and what has been said many times in these discussions about Putin, Russia, insecurity and so on.<\/p><p>Most of our imports come from the North Sea.  That could and should continue the case if we have to rely on imports for a short period.  The Minister of State's logic is that this source will be very insecure for us, that they are not reliable sources and that we would be far better off relying on a combination of Exxon Mobil and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation which have been granted the licence referred to by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Ireland has just celebrated, or marked, the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests that were dominated by tyranny, abuse, human rights abuses and the suppression, jailing and murder of people by the Chinese state.  What makes them nicer guys than President Putin?  What makes him such a nice guy that one of the companies that continually lobbies this House, Petrel Resources, does deals with Gazprom in Crimea?  I find the entire issue of energy security contradictory, but the fundamental point is that there will be no such security on a planet that will overheat by more than 2&deg; C.  That is not disputable.  It is the science.  If one accepts the science of climate catastrophe and emergency, it is indisputable.  Energy security is being used in a spurious way in the geopolitical argument.  I do not accept it whatsoever, no matter how many times the Government tries to frame it this way or that way.<\/p><p> There is another obvious argument in that there is no legal obligation on any company that receives an exploration or drilling licence from the Department to sell back to the State whatever it finds.  Ireland's natural resources are not ours in that regard.  Long ago, during the Shell to Sea campaign, our natural resources were sold and that continues to be the case.  I would like to see our natural resources remain in the ground.  Reference was made to the possibility of getting 55% tax back on this resource and how that would be great to fund climate change initiatives.  That, however, is contradictory.  Taking them out of the ground, burning more carbon and then using the tax generated to build an extra bicycle lane or put another electric bus on the streets of Galway is just crazy.  That is not doing politics in the correct way.<\/p><p> I put it to the Minister of State that we will continue to fight.  We are seeking legal advice on the issue of a money message.  People will be outside Leinster House in half an hour to call on the Government to keep fossil fuels in the ground and not to kill the Bill.  The movement is big.  It involves tens of thousands of schoolchildren and tens of thousands of citizens both here and across the globe.  There is no Tricolour flying out of the carbon emitted from the fuel extracted off the Kerry or Donegal coastline.  It does not recognise boundaries.  It is an atmosphere we share globally as a human race and we need to take responsibility to do something about it.  The Minister of State could be famous and a leader in that regard.  Ireland is one of five countries that have acknowledged that we need to ban the exploration of fossil fuels.  It could be the making of the Minister of State's political endeavours to do something decent for the globe.  We are going to keep fighting, legally and outside with the movement, every which way.  I thank all of the Deputies who are on side with us on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#L03900","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I will now go to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#M00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Perhaps Deputy Eamon Ryan has another question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019061100002#M00300","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I will explain again why I am seeking legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers separate from the legal advice Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith will have.  This is unprecedented.  In this D&aacute;il the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 has been delayed for two years by the Department by way of a money message, but from the start it was always clear that this would be the mechanism the Government would use.  As a result of one and a half years' work on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 there was a clear understanding in the debates and discussions that a money message would not be required for it.  Other mechanisms were used, especially the split vote at the joint committee that looked at the Bill.  We finally overcame it, but at the very last minute, when we were about to proceed to Committee Stage, the money message issue arose.  One of the outcomes of Committee Stage would have been amendments to the Bill to make it clear that it would not put a financial burden on the State because it would be made clear that the legislation would only apply to new explorations.  There are different views on that matter, but I believe that is where the Bill would have gone.<\/p> <p>  The Executive is exceeding its powers in the use of a money message at the last minute to stop a debate that was due to take place.  Other mechanisms had been tried to do that.  It is taking the constitutional provision that we cannot have the Opposition writing the budget.  That is fair enough and we have to respect that provision, but in this instance the use of a money message was not for that purpose.  It was tactical.  That is how it appears from the timelines and process involved.  That is why it is a particularly egregious example of the Executive showing disrespect to the Oireachtas and the people's representatives.  That is the core of the problem, as well as the underlying issue of Government support for the Bill.

At the outset, the simple and clear statement one can make is that the experience of becoming and being homeless is deeply traumatic for children and their parents and has the potential to have lifelong consequences.  It is extremely important that the country addresses that issue from the perspective of children.  Historically, homelessness has been seen as a problem experienced largely by adults, particularly adult men.  The legislation passed by the Oireachtas to guide local authorities in responding to homelessness is blind in respect of children, and that follows through in the practice and the way the interests of families, particularly children, are addressed throughout the homelessness system.  Obviously, that gap or absence could be addressed by changes in practice and in regulation, but it falls primarily to the Houses of the Oireachtas which passed the original legislation that guides the homelessness services to amend that legislation so the interests of the child can be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Focus Ireland is recognised as the homelessness and housing organisation that has the longest experience of working with homeless families.  We have worked with homeless families for over 30 years.  Ms Niamh Lambe is the team leader of the family homeless action team which works with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in supporting several hundred children and their families in Dublin, helping them to cope with homelessness and, essentially, helping them to move out of homelessness.  A key part of what we have come to understand, and it is crucial to how we should be responding to the homelessness problem, is that families that are coping with homelessness are more likely to move successfully out of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  There is an increasing sense that the frustration with the scale of the homelessness crisis is leading to a concentration at policy level that is concerned only with numbers.  We consider the total number of children and families who are homeless and the Minister and the Department repeatedly tell us the number of families who have moved out of homelessness.  We do not doubt that the total numbers are extremely important, but a concentration only on numbers overlooks the reality of life as experienced by families and children who are homeless.  If we have measures of success regarding family homelessness that just count the number of families who move out of homelessness, the inevitable long-term consequences will be that the families who have the greatest vulnerabilities and who are suffering the most in homelessness will be the ones who are left behind.  They will be unable to access private rented accommodation and will find themselves at the end of queue, even for social housing.  We will come to the end of this homelessness crisis, and we must come to the end of it sometime no matter how many years it takes, with a residue of a large number of families who have been homeless for a very long period and a large number of families whose future lives will be destroyed because of their long period of homelessness.  How we handle this issue is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  I believe the committee's invitation issued to us as a result of the excellent report from the Ombudsman for Children, No Place Like Home.  Focus Ireland has welcomed the report.  It is a very wise balance between listening to the voices of the children concerned and examining in forensic depth the policies, or absence of policies, in respect of family homelessness.  We particularly welcome the recommendation in the report that the Houses of the Oireachtas support the Private Members' legislation from the Labour Party to amend the housing legislation to include the rights of the child.  It has been supported by all parties in the House but has not been passed into law.  We support that legislation.  We also support the recommendation of the Oireachtas committee on the right to housing.  However, the rights of children that we put in our Constitution recently do not appear to have influenced the way children are treated in the homelessness system.  We must not only change our Constitution but also put into effect the changes we have already made in it.<\/p> <p>  We also support something that is at the heart of what the Ombudsman for Children's report is saying.  The only part of policy in respect of families who are homeless in which the Government is proactively engaged is the introduction of family hubs.<\/p><p>Nobody is defending putting children into hotels and nobody is defending putting children and families into bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is important to note that the Ombudsman's report looks only at hubs.  The majority of children and their families are not in hubs; they are in far worse accommodation than is provided by the hubs.  It is legitimate to look at the hubs, however, because the Government is standing over that, saying it is a positive intervention and that this is what the Government wants to do.  The Government is putting the provision of hubs forward as good practice, and therefore it is appropriate to look at that in detail.  When one looks at what is happening in the hubs - and the Ombudsman's report is excellent on this - one finds that there is no policy and it is not clear what analysis of the homelessness problem is being put forward, to which the hubs are meant to be a solution, other than that the hubs are better than hotels.  We need to move away from an approach to homelessness in general which says that one type of intervention is better than people being on the street or better than being in emergency accommodation.  We need to have a much more ambitious and deeper understanding of homelessness.  If that statement is true of all homelessness, and the 10,000 men, women and children who are homeless in the State, it is ten times more true when we talk about children and the extent to which we as a nation are failing our children after so many generations of doing that before and thinking we have learned the lessons.  We have almost 4,000 children currently in homeless accommodation, and the consequences of that experience on their lives will be devastating.  It is extremely welcome that this committee is looking at that issue.<\/p><p> With the practice that Ms Lambe can bring and the policy and research that I can bring to the advocacy team, I hope we can help the committee to look at a way forward and find ways of addressing this problem more effectively.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Allen.

I shall pick up on two points made by Mr. Allen.  The witness said that legislation would have to be changed, and he heavily referenced the Ombudsman's report.  What legislation would Mr. Allen amend and what would the amendments be?  Mr. Allen referred to the production of information for the public to digest around homeless numbers and men, women and children in unsuitable accommodations.   I am paraphrasing Mr. Allen when he took issue with the Department only producing numbers and the inference that the reports miss the individuals in question.  How would Mr. Allen come to that conclusion and, more important, what measure does he believe would be more appropriate for the Department to produce in order to inform the public of the position, specifically around children in unsuitable accommodations or in homelessness and their parents? Perhaps Mr. Allen could address those two questions to get us started and then we will open up the discussion to others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#H00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560207600,"counter":533,"content":"<p>The legislation of the late 1980s defines homelessness and gives the authority to the local authorities to deal with the issues.  It was very important and groundbreaking legislation at the time.  It understands homelessness as something that happens to an adult individual.  It refers in passing to \"any other person who normally resides with him or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him\".  In the interim, since that legislation was passed, we have had all the revelations about the abuse of children in State and other institutions.<\/p><p>We have had Children First legislation, the approach to which social workers and others have fully adopted, and the children's rights referendum, but none of it has carried into practice.  In an ideal world we would not have to deal with this issue, but in a world which would be a bit better than what we have, we would go through a major process of rethinking homeless legislation through consultation on how it would be drawn up in a way that would reflect the reality of how it would affect children.  It is interesting to note that while family homelessness is a big issue in the United States for instance, in most European countries it is not an issue in the way we are experiencing it.  It is a unique experience.<\/p><p> The proposed Private Members' Bill which is referred to in the Ombudsman's report proposes to insert into existing legislation that the local authority would have to take into account the best interests of the child.  It is a clever and elegant piece of work.  It is not the perfect solution, but the children in homeless accommodation cannot wait the four years it would take to do the perfect job.  Therefore, it is important legislation.  I know that it has not been supported by all parties represented in the Houses, but to see it become law and carried through into action would make a significant difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>From my perspective alone and notwithstanding anything the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government might be doing, it has often been the case in my years in the Houses that we have declared something as an emergency such as the climate emergency, for instance.  It is all well and good to declare something as an emergency, but something has to be done after the emergency is declared, or preferably beforehand.  I have visited hubs, hotels, social housing, unsuitable and suitable private rented accommodation and seen all of it.  I am sure I have not seen half as much as Mr. Allen, but I like to think I have a good grasp of this issue.  My observation on it is that if we enshrine primary legislation, with specific information on and tasks to be performed for children, how will we implement it, with the local authorities and approved housing bodies?  We must recognise that citizens are citizens, regardless of whether they are children or adults.  Is it fair and equitable to take a person who is 15th, 20th or 30th on a waiting list for social housing or bump up a person on the waiting list for a six-month hub placement on the basis that there is a child to be housed?  I appreciate the remit of the committee, but at the same I recognise that we are dealing with citizens, individuals who reside in the State, who have a right to housing, as enshrined in legislation.  I recognise everything that comes with it.<\/p> <p>  I refer to hubs and the standard of same which Mr. Allen referenced in his submission.  It is a critical contribution to this discussion.  Deputy Rabbitte and I, with a former member of the committee, were in a family hub in Inchicore and I was impressed by it.  I was impressed by the services being provided.  In Mr. Allen's professional experience, are we rolling out such facilities and is the standard the same?  Are there variances in how they are being managed?  I mention the fact that the Ombudsman has highlighted certain deficiencies.  Does Mr. Allen have recommendations he would like to make?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#J00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560207600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I return to the changes legislation would make.  We are not specifically saying putting it into housing legislation would change the allocation of housing, for instance.  To a large extent, the local authorities do what these Houses tell them to do.  When somebody who works for a local authority sits down and asks what his or her responsibilities are, he or she looks at the legislation and sees that the Houses of Oireachtas have not told him or her to look after the children in families and to have a particular perspective on that issue.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas were to do so, a number of matters would stem from it, of which regulation would be the first.<\/p><p>As far as I am aware not a single local authority in the country has given its own staff any guidelines, recommendations or training whatsoever on how their services should respond to the fact that they now have parents coming in with children who are in trauma.  There is no guidance, no training, nothing.  That follows through into all the systems.  I know there has been criticism in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and here of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and the Department because they cannot tell us how many children move out of homelessness but they can tell the number of adults.  That is because all the systems are designed around adults, which in turn is because the legislation states that homelessness is a thing that happens to adults.  It is not a magic wand and will not solve the problem but if children are not written into the legislation they will be forgotten because there is huge pressure on all the systems which to some extent will do what they are told and if children are ignored that will be lost, and that is what is happening.<\/p><p> The implications of the child-centred approach are quite frightening because they raise all sorts of serious questions but we cannot avoid them by not raising them.  Ms Lambe may come in on that topic but first I will speak about the standards in the hubs and how our organisation sees them.  Focus Ireland is not opposed to hubs.  The question over the years has been whether we are for or against them.  What we know from international experience is that putting people who are homeless into congregated or institutional settings for significant periods does them harm.  It makes it harder for them to re-enter mainstream living.  That is even more true of families.  Any form of institutional living where 20 or, in some cases, 60 families are put in one place, even if it has wonderful facilities and so on, is not a good idea.  It may be better than having them on the street but it is not a good idea.  We want to avoid a discussion about the best form of hub.  There are some very good ones and some very poor ones but we should be looking for another solution.  The best practice in emergency accommodation is to not have a homeless problem and if we have a homeless problem the best practice is own-door accommodation.  That raises real questions because as we see across Britain the local authorities have a number of social houses and instead of putting people into these as their homes they put them in as emergency accommodation.  People say they are wasting a house and ask why it is not given to somebody but if some form of emergency accommodation is needed that is the best.  There are real trade-offs in that.<\/p><p> I want to briefly address the numbers and the data.  If there is one issue in discussing homelessness that is driving people to distraction it is a row about what the numbers are.  The minute we started counting the numbers in 2014 they became a political instrument.  The Opposition uses them to attack the Government and the Government uses them to say things are going well.  That is the least important use of statistics.  If someone listening says Focus Ireland is sometimes in that game too we put our hands up.  We have used them to highlight how serious the problem is.  We all need to recognise that using statistics in that way does not necessarily lead to good outcomes.  The main reason for collecting statistics is to understand what is happening.  The changes that the Government made in taking a particular group of families and saying if they are in own-door accommodation, if they have their own key to their door, even though they have been given the accommodation because they are homeless and are funded under section 10 in the Housing Act 1988, they are not homeless any more.  There are certain things we could understand before about the flow into and out of homelessness that we cannot understand any more.  We could see families come into and leave homelessness from the statistics.  We cannot see them.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, says he cannot predict how many families will be homeless next year but part of the reason for that is the way the figures are handled.  A family that enters homelessness and goes into a hotel is still homeless, when it moves into own-door accommodation it stops being homeless, according to the figures, but it is not measured as leaving homelessness.  It moves from own-door accommodation into its own home and then leaves homelessness but was not homeless beforehand.<\/p><p>It begins to be very torturous.  Where there is own-door accommodation in Britain it is recognised as the better form of accommodation.  British authorities recognise that it is different from the other form of accommodation but they count it.  Progress through it can be tracked.  If, for whatever reason, the Government wants to say that people living in own-door emergency accommodation are somehow in a different category from those in a hub or hotel, that is fine.  However, we call on the Government to publish the data so that we can see the patterns and who is moving where.  If organisations like our own collectively agree on how to report and use the data we have, we will be in a much stronger position to solve the problem, rather than using it as a brickbat to beat each other over the head with, which is unfortunately the situation at which we have arrived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>We have been in that position for a while, but I agree.

The Focus Ireland family homeless action team works in 15 private emergency accommodations and nine hubs.  To echo what Mr. Allen said, hubs are obviously not the ideal.  However, while families are in a hub we find that things work well if the staff has social care training and if child support workers are in place.  As I mentioned earlier, our team deals with more than 1,000 children.  We are the largest team working with homeless families in Dublin.  Only 9% of the child support workers on our team are working with children.  If every child had a child support worker, whether he or she was in a hub or in private emergency accommodation, that would make a huge improvement to overall family outcomes.  It would help both the parent and the child to move on more successfully and to be less traumatised by homelessness.  In the hubs where there is social care training one can see the difference.  Behaviour is managed better and supports are in place.<\/p> <p>  Some of the hubs also have more facilities and spaces for key working.  Children should not meet a key worker alongside their parents while their parents are in trauma and are disclosing what has happened to them with regard to homelessness.  More facilities should be in place so that children have the one-to-one support they require based on their developmental needs and so that parents also have their own support.  Some accommodation has shared kitchen facilities.  The facilities are better than those in private emergency accommodation but there is still a long way to go.  We have to acknowledge that children are severely displaced as well.  We have children travelling to school from Ballymun and elsewhere on the north side to the south side and all over Dublin.  Self-accommodating families are also a major issue for us because they move from place to place each night.  There is huge displacement for children.  I firmly believe that child support workers should be in place for all children and parents.

That is the Focus Ireland model which we developed as a social impact bond from our experience with the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive.  Around 2012 we thought there was a major problem with family homelessness.  At the time in Dublin there were about 160 homeless families, some of whom had been homeless for eight or nine years and been forgotten.  We set up this team to work with them.  We argued that the children needed this, that it was good practice and that it actually helped to end homelessness.  One of the reasons families are unable to sustainably move out of homelessness is the difficulties their children experience.  The HSE funded the child support workers in the initial phase.  Two years ago, under the Government, Tusla gave us three more child support workers.  The team is funded partly by the HSE and partly by Tusla.  However, there are now twice as many homeless children as there were at the time of the last increase.  The system of child support workers has not been adopted as the model in most of the hubs or by any other local authority.  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive is recruiting a family team for its own staff, but it is entirely concentrated on the needs of adults, which is not just bad for the children.  As Ms Lambe said, it is also less effective in tackling homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Allen"},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I would like to touch base on the topic of education.

I have asked this question before, specifically about children, and never received a satisfactory answer.  Broadly, regarding the 10,000 people living in unsuitable accommodation in the State, is it possible for us to look back at Irish history and determine what was the level of unsuitable accommodation?  I know that there are too many on social and affordable housing waiting lists.  That is obvious to everybody.  They are too long.  There are too many people in family hubs and too many children in unsuitable accommodation.  However, what is considered to be an acceptable level?  There has to be a level that is transient.  It is similar to what we deem to be full employment - an unemployment level of 5% or thereabouts.  Some say it is 6% and others 4%, but we know that the level is there or thereabouts.  I would prefer if there were no children in unsuitable accommodation in the State.  However, I know that it is a reality of life.  There will always be people in transient accommodation or in need of support from the State or other organisations such as Focus Ireland.  Is it possible for us to look back and determine what was the level of homelessness or, as I call it, more appropriately, unsuitable accommodation, at particular moments?

There is nothing worse than reading about the emergencies that occur when the weather worsens in December, January or February of every year because individuals refuse to avail of accommodation.

I have been out on the streets on a couple of occasions over the years at such times so I know it is really disheartening when one does one's best, as I am sure it is for Focus Ireland, to deal with individuals who refuse to take shelter.  At the same time, if accommodation does not have its own door and a garden or gardenette, I do not view it as permanent.  If it is not permanent then it is not a solution.

As a society, a policy of responding to homelessness by building emergency shelters, which is what we have done - it is not what we have tried to do but it is what we have ended up doing - does not work.  Let us consider the countries that have long-term homelessness.  New York is a very problematic example because there was a campaign just after the Second World War whereby a commitment was given in New York that everybody had a right to shelter, not a right to a home but a right to shelter.  As a result there are tens of thousands of shelters and people are permanently in them.  Let us consider Finland, which is the good case, where shelters have been closed and people have been given homes.  We must make sure that the crisis response is not where we end up in permanent crisis.  If we continue the way we are going at the moment then that is where we are headed.

It is important to acknowledge that.  For a minute there I felt that the conversation was becoming normal.  This cannot become a normal conversation because it is not normal to have 4,000 children in emergency accommodation of any sort whether it is in a hub, bed and breakfast or whatever.  If children do not have their own front door or are not in accommodation located near their own community where they can attend their local school or engage in their activities in their own community, then it is not their home.  The only solution is to start building houses.  That is not what we are discussing today but that is the solution.  What we need to do in the middle of this crisis is ensure people have a better experience of the trauma that they are encountering.  Earlier Mr. Allen said that some things need to change in terms of best practice.  Some best practices do not cost money.  They call for common sense, decency, manners and empathy, which must start in local county councils.  We should have rooms for families who present to county councils.  They should not have to wait in queues.  They should not have to be conscious that their children are roaring or need feeding.  They should not feel like they are on show in a very public format.<\/p><p>The trauma they are experiencing is being exacerbated tenfold by having to sit there, on the third floor at Galway County Council, waiting to meet a housing officer when they press the bell and if he or she is at lunch, they will have to wait for two hours.  That is not the way it should be, but that is the trauma about which Ms Lambe talks and Focus Ireland has to bring in social care workers to help to address that experience.  A mother might nearly have lost her marbles and lost the will to live because she is being told that the family might have to be split up into different rooms in order to find accommodation that night and they might not all find it in the one hotel room.  That is not normal, but that is the trauma experienced.<\/p><p> It is a question of how we do business in the various county councils.  They need to learn that the people in question have, for whatever reason, fallen on hard times.  None of us has today discussed the elephant in the room, that this housing accommodation issue is not going to end because we are still coming to terms with the banking crisis.  We are coming to the end of the ten-year debt period for our fixed-term loans which are just starting to mature.  It is a fact that more people will become homeless in the foreseeable future.  How we do business in the various councils, therefore, needs to improve.<\/p><p> We need to hear from Focus Ireland on best practice in how people engage with others.  Ms Lambe is correct that we need to invest in people with the skill set and empathy required - I keep coming back to the word \"empathy\" - to engage with parents and children in order that they will not be scarred for years to come.  That is a big statement piece by me, but I feel passionately about it and it does not cost money.<\/p><p> I do not know how long Ms Lambe has been working on the issue of hubs, but what does she notice?  What stands out in what she sees on a daily basis?  What does she hear back from case managers?  What are they saying about repeat incidents and the trauma children are experiencing?  At the end of the day, it has to be about the children.  When we assess people for housing, they have to wait at Galway County Council.  I can only talk about the position in Galway because that is my area.  If a person has a disability, is living in an overcrowded and unfit house or is participating in the HAP scheme or the RAS, nowhere is he or she asked whether there are children involved or how many there are or whether there is a family network involved.  It is about numbers.  We do not hear the voice of the child or the whole community.  What is Ms Lambe finding?  What does her research show?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#R00800","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560207600,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for her passion and empathy because they are things we should never lose.  We are seeing a lot of trauma.  It is very important to acknowledge that when a child becomes homeless, it is his or her first traumatising experience.  If we talk about adverse childhood experiences, children experience more and more trauma as they stay in homeless accommodation and the longer they stay, the more they will experience.  The stories I hear on a weekly basis from case managers and child support workers include children having sleepless nights, the antisocial behaviour of other neighbours within the hubs and private emergency accommodation and children losing the ability to go out and play on the road, very basic things a child needs.  For example, children are not able to go to the sitting room and play or have friends over on a play date because they have to be supervised when playing with their neighbours who are also homeless children.  We are seeing suicidal ideation among very young children, although I do not want to sensationalise it.  It is not among all children, but it is certainly present and increasing.  There are, therefore, child protection and welfare concerns.  We are seeing children missing school a lot because of the displacement to which I referred all over Dublin.  I am not just talking about the children in hubs and private emergency accommodation; I have not even focused on self-accommodating, one-night-only, families who are on the periphery and even more marginalised.<\/p> <p>  On health, there is the question of what children are eating.  For example, there are shared kitchens.  I am a mother.  If I was given a time slot to cook and do my washing, I would find it very difficult.  It is very difficult for families to even maintain what they might or might not have had before they became homeless in terms of maintaining a family lifestyle for their children.<\/p> <p>  For children, the stigma is huge.  They cannot have their friends over, which is bad enough, but they also cannot tell them why they cannot have them over.<\/p><p>They were living around the corner from their school friends one minute and the next they were living far away and also not in school as much.  Those children may not even be turning up to school.  There are, therefore, many layers of trauma involved.  Children might also not be getting support if a parent has addiction issues as well.  I do not want to sensationalise that aspect.  Many families do not have to deal with addiction issues.  They have fallen on hard times and become homeless.  Children experience many layers of trauma daily and are retraumatised each day by their experience of homelessness.  <\/p><p> The child support workers on the team work through that trauma with holistic play, one to one interaction and group work.  They are the voices for the children and they listen to the children.  It is important that those children have that support for themselves alone.  They are exposed to very adult conversations a great deal.  The eldest children in a family will often become additional primary care givers as well if mom or dad cannot cope.  They become additional parents within the family.  There are, therefore, layers upon layers of trauma involved.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019061100002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Lambe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560207600,"counter":627,"content":"<p>That is fine.

Children in this situation are not reaching their milestones at the same stage as children who are in homes in the true sense of that word.  Are there professionals in Focus Ireland, or other organisations, who assess those milestones and keep an eye on the developmental goals that could impact on those children?  All parents want their children to reach their developmental goals.  We often hear about children who are ahead of those goals.  I refer to my niece being so advanced whenever I talk about her, jokingly in a way.
