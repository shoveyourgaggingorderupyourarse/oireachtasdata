This action by the US resulted in steel originally destined for the US market being diverted to the EU with the associated risk of flooding the EU market with steel products to the detriment of Union industry and producers.<\/p>  <p>  In response, in 2018, the European Commission brought forward Safeguard Measures to manage the volume of steel entering the Single Market from 3rd countries. The Measures currently in place allow for the importation of steel from 3rd countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel using the 2015-2017 reference period. Steel imports outside of the quota limits are subject to a 25% tariff on landing in the EU. These current Measures are due to expire at the end of June 2021, unless prolonged after further review.<\/p>  <p>Due to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, as of 1st  \u00a0January 2021, the UK is no longer party to the EU&rsquo;s Measures and the UK is now a 3rd country in relation to the application of the EU&rsquo;s Safeguard Measures. Under the EU&rsquo;s Safeguards, the UK - now operating as a 3rd country - has been allocated its own specific quotas for the majority of the EU&rsquo;s 26 product categories subject to the Measures.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in anticipation of the UK&rsquo;s new status as a 3rd country, in September 2020, the UK Government issued a notice stating that it would establish its own set of Safeguard Measures and \"transition\" 19 of the 26 product categories subject of EU Safeguards from the 1st January 2021. The UK has also calculated its own quota levels for imports of steel products from 3rd countries, including the EU into the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Irish importers can continue to import steel from the UK without the additional \"Safeguard\" tariff of 25% if the volume of imports remains within the EU's quota allocations for the UK.\u00a0 Imports from the UK to Ireland, or other EU Member States, in excess of these quotas will attract a 25% tariff. Similarly, imports of steel from other 3rd countries into Ireland would also be subject to a 25% tariff if the exporting country exceeds the available quota. Importantly, however, Irish importers can continue to import steel from the rest of the EU as part of the Single Market where no tariffs or quotas apply.<\/p>  <p>  In applying the Safeguard Measures, the European Commission has undertaken 2 reviews of the Measures, with the most recent review conducted in June 2020. The findings of that review included details on the availability of quotas for each product category. The Commission's review found that in the last quarter of year-2 of the measures (i.e. April - June 2020), a significant level of quotas remained unused, with quotas available in      every product category.\u00a0 Furthermore the review noted that as of 15\u00a0May 2020, there were 9      million tonnes, or 29% of the total quotas, available for use in year-2      of the Measures ('year-3' of the Measures began in July 2020). This would indicate that the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures does not affect the availability of supply, as quotas are not exhausted before the end of a given period.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Commission has previously stated that the imposition of Safeguard Measures are not designed to unduly restrict trade flows but are instead designed to allow a level of imports proportionate to the needs of the Union market. This principle remains in place, now that the United Kingdom is a 3rd country in relation to the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, neither my Department, nor any of our Enterprise Agencies, is aware of any supply concerns by industry regarding imports of steel into Ireland. The quotas available for steel reflect traditional levels of trade in steel and the Commission's evidence suggests that the quotas are not being exhausted. Conversely, demand for steel has declined as a result of COVID-19, with the Commission and industry advising that it could be 2022 before demand returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. This would suggest that the imposition of Safeguard Measures should not result in any supply issues for industry.<\/p>  <p>Finally, officials in my Department will continue to monitor the situation and they remain actively engaged with the Commission on the matter including the interplay between the Measures and the Northern Ireland Protocol with the view of finalising how Measures should operate and apply in respect of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Future Growth Loan Scheme","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[5645\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the value of approvals made under the future growth loan scheme to date.","asker":"1462","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes lending available to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps seeking financing for long-term strategic investment, including in response to the impacts of Brexit and COVID-19.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in April 2019 and initially made available up to &euro;300m in lending to be delivered over a three-year window.

It is an important mechanism that allows consumers and companies to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage, as the completion of national ratification procedures across all 27 Member States can take several years.\u00a0 The full coming into force of the Agreement once ratified across all Member States, will see the implementation of the Investment Chapter of the Agreement including the resolution of disputes between investors and states, should they arise. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements. \u00a0Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments. \u00a0The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  ISDS, which has been in existence since the 1950s, enables overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where their investment is made through binding international arbitration. \u00a0ISDS has been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties but has proved controversial in recent times and is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission. \u00a0In this regard, the Irish Government considered the European Commission was right to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding ISDS in seeking to develop a new replacement mechanism &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS) &ndash; to address concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interest. \u00a0ICS is the Investment Dispute Settlement system incorporated in CETA.<\/p>  <p>  ICS addressees the concerns around the old ISDS system through:<\/p>  <p>  - Greater transparency &ndash; hearings will be open and comments available on-line, and a right to intervene for parties with an interest in the dispute will be provided;<\/p>  <p>  - Safeguards to prevent forum-shopping;<\/p>  <p>  - Provisions for the swift dismissal of frivolous claims should they arise;<\/p>  <p>  - The maintenance of a clear distinction between international law and domestic law;<\/p>  <p>  - The avoidance of multiple and parallel proceedings in the ICS and national courts, and;<\/p>  <p>  - The establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators.<\/p>  <p>  The reforms to investment protection mean the ICS will involve:<\/p>  <p>  - a public Investment Court System composed of a first instance Tribunal and an Appeal Tribunal;<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators with qualifications &ndash; comparable to those required for the members of permanent international courts, from which members will be selected to hear individual cases; and\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - precise limitations on the ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  Irish companies investing in Canada have only one legal system and one constitutional framework to navigate should they believe they have been discriminated against. \u00a0In contrast, Canadian companies investing in Europe are faced with 27 legal systems and constitutions. \u00a0The Investment Court System provides a single, consistent mechanism where investors, be they Canadian or European, can seek redress.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning measures relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, or minimum alcohol pricing can continue to be introduced. \u00a0Further, an investor&rsquo;s loss of profits will not be sufficient grounds for making a claim against a Government. \u00a0Any claim must be based on discriminatory and unfair treatment.<\/p>  <p>  On its own initiative, the European Commission referred to the\u00a0Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) the question of competence as it applied to the EU and the Member States regarding the signing and ratifying of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (ref 02\/15).\u00a0\u00a0The resulting Opinion of the Court, which came after the agreement with Canada had been reached, reinforced our understanding as to where Member State competence rests in relation to certain investment aspects and the attendant obligation on Member States to ratify agreements containing such commitments.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In a consequent move aimed at greater transparency, the European Commission adopted a new approach in the case of Agreements with Vietnam and Singapore, separating out the \"EU-only\" from the \"shared competence\" elements into two parallel agreements - an exclusively Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and an exclusively Investment Protection Agreement (IPA) respectively.\u00a0 The IPAs concluded with both countries contain ICS provisions and will each fall to be ratified by all EU Member States in accordance with their national requirements, in due course.\u00a0 So, ICS continues to be the EU's ambition for IPAs.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) which was agreed in principle on 30 December 2020, initially, the CAI was intended to contain Investment Protection provisions, however, specific Investment Protection negotiations have not yet been concluded and will now continue on a separate track with the CAI focused on market access opportunities and related matters. However, the EU and China have committed to striving to conclude Investment Protection negotiations within the two years following the signature of the CAI and the EU ambition is for an ICS outcome.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EU is not a party to a third country agreement, but in relation to Mexico I can assure the Deputy that in the modernising of the EU&rsquo;s Association Agreement with Mexico,\u00a0ICS provisions are included.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As far as the EU-UK deal - the TCA - is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that this was very much a &ldquo;bare bones&rdquo; agreement, negotiated in record time and, consequently, omitted many traditional elements of an FTA and left others for further negotiation and settlement.\u00a0 So I do not think that the TCA can be taken as any sort of exemplar of a model ambitious trade and investment agreement.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefitted immensely from our export orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we fully support balanced international trade and the suite of EU Free Trade Agreements that seek to underpin this.\u00a0 Equally, Ireland has been an attractive destination for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for many decades and participating in EU-Third Country Agreements that address Investment Protection continue to assist marketing Ireland as a competitive FDI-friendly jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to make their investments with the attendant jobs and prosperity that that entails.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be recorded that investment disputes can continue to be litigated before national Courts and what ICS offers is an alternative approach for an aggrieved investor.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB08200","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB08400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB08300"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[5993\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB08400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the savings made by the EEOS by type of customer, that is, commercial, private and energy poverty; and the social impact analysis and the average efficiency gain per customer, that is, average depth of retrofit.","asker":"1468","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[5995\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300059#WRB08500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the impact of the EEOS on customer bills.","asker":"1468","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under Article 7 of the European Union&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Directive, Member States are required to make a specified amount of energy savings that meet certain criteria defined by the Directive. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland established an Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme (EEOS) in 2014 in order to achieve a portion of these savings.  An obligation scheme is a regulatory requirement on energy suppliers and distributors to help energy users save energy. This can be achieved by supporting the energy user (financially or otherwise) to implement energy saving practices or to carry out energy upgrades in their property.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s energy efficiency obligation scheme is administered on my behalf by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The scheme requires suppliers with a market sales volume in Ireland of greater than 600 GWh per annum to achieve savings. The amount of savings each obligated party is required to make is related to their overall market share. The amount of savings to be delivered is as follows: 75% in the non-residential sector, 20% in the residential sector, and 5% among customers in energy poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Preliminary data indicates that between 2014-2020, the EEOS successfully supported energy efficiency actions in more than 291,000 dwellings and 4,750 businesses, achieving final energy savings of over 3,450 GWh.<\/p>  <p>  The achievement and average annual energy saving under each sector is:<\/p>  <p>  - Energy Poor = 74,439[1] properties covered with an average saving of 3,304kWh per dwelling;<\/p>  <p>  - Residential = 224,2241 properties covered with an average saving of 3,587[2] kWh per dwelling;<\/p>  <p>  - Non-Residential = 750,000 kWh per site\/premises (Non-residential projects have a large range with some below 10,000 kWh and some in excess of 100 GWH).<\/p>  <p>  SEAI does not collect information from the obligated parties in relation to the cost of delivering savings under the EEOS. However, in 2017 the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published a report indicating that the average cost for electricity and gas suppliers to deliver a kWh of savings under the EEOS was 4.4c per kWh in 2015 and 5.6c per kWh in 2016. As a portion of all gas and electricity sales in those years this is equivalent to between 0.03c and 0.05c per kWh on the bill for commercial and domestic customers if passed on directly. It is up to each obligated party to decide how to fund these savings. Oil companies obligated under the scheme meet their costs through a levy of 0.12c per litre of oil sold. <\/p>  <p>  Last year, the Department published a paper stating that Ireland would use an obligation scheme again for the period 2021-2030. An interim obligation scheme is now in place for 2021 and a public consultation on the design of the scheme to be implemented from 2022-2030 will be published later this month.  The collection of cost data will be among the topics for consultation.<\/p>  <p>  [1] Some homes have received support on more than one occasion.

The Strategy set out several actions to alleviate the burden of energy poverty on the most vulnerable in society. The focus of the strategy was on high impact actions which aimed to make a real difference to the lives of those in energy poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Good progress has been made under the strategy including:<\/p>  <p>  - Free upgrades were carried out in over 23,000 lower income homes under the main SEAI energy poverty schemes; <\/p>  <p>  - A consultation on energy efficiency in the rented sector has also been completed which has informed changes to energy efficiency grant schemes with further recommendations to follow later this year;<\/p>  <p>  - Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;109 million for\u00a02021. <\/p>  <p>  - The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021. <\/p>  <p>  At the time of its launch, the Strategy was accompanied by a report on the level and extent of energy poverty in Ireland. This study looked at what the typical household has to spend on energy to keep their home heated and compared that to household income. This report found that in 2016, 28% of households in Ireland could be in or at risk of energy poverty.\u00a0 The ERSI published reports in 2019 and 2020 which calculated the current level of energy poverty. In 2020 the ESRI calculated that the proportion in or at risk of energy poverty had reduced from 28%\u00a0to 17.5%. These rates align closely to the level of basic deprivation experienced in Ireland.\u00a0 A separate ESRI study suggested that energy poverty is primarily a function of inadequate resources to cover living costs rather than simply an energy issue.\u00a0 In addition under the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform publishes an annual Public Service Performance Report. My Department provides input to this report annually in relation to the number of lower income households supported to improve their energy efficiency. The Department of Social Protection also provides input in relation to the number of households in receipt of income supports and the impact on the rate of poverty.\u00a0 The Report is submitted to Government for information and is published on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to providing &euro;5 billion to part fund a socially progressive national retrofit programme targeting all homes but with a particular focus on the Midlands region and on social and lower income tenancies.\u00a0 This is in addition to &euro;3.7 billion to support our retrofit targets in the National Development Plan.\u00a0\u00a0&euro;109 million in exchequer funding has been provided tis year to support lower income households to retrofit their homes.\u00a0 This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. Recommendations aimed at improving the targeting of energy poverty schemes at those most in need will be finalised soon.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to ensuring that increases in the carbon tax are progressive by spending &euro;3 billion on targeted social welfare and other initiatives to prevent fuel\u00a0poverty\u00a0and ensure a just transition.\u00a0\u00a0As part of Budget 2021\u00a0the Fuel Allowance will increase by &euro;3.50 to &euro;28 per week.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year.\u00a0 Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key consideration for the National Retrofit Plan which will be published this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300060#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300060#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[5037\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300060#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his engagements with a company (details supplied) in relation to the acceleration of the National Broadband Plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[5789\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300060#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the work being carried out to speed up the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan in view of the fact that some persons have reported that their jobs may be on the line due to their subpar internet access in rural areas.","asker":"1519","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 77 together. \u00a041\u00a0and\u00a077\u00a0together.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities.

The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300060#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Just Transition Fund","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300060#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[1390\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300060#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will report on the expenditure priorities of Ireland for the EU Just Transition Fund in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>The EU Just Transition Fund will be used to alleviate the socio-economic impacts of the low carbon transition in the most affected regions across the EU by, for example, supporting the re-skilling of workers, helping SMEs to create new economic opportunities, and diversification of\u00a0economic activity.\u00a0 Ireland has secured an allocation of &euro;77 million from the EU Just Transition Fund for investments over the period 2021 to 2027.\u00a0    In accordance with the relevant EU legislation, Ireland must now prepare a Territorial Just Transition Plan, for approval by the European Commission, in order to secure access to its EU allocation of funding.

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the\u00a0pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the\u00a0Government\u00a0agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.\u00a0 In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial\u00a0basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to\u00a0the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government\u00a0decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.\u00a0 The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services\u00a0that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related\u00a0support.<\/p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department,\u00a0entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding\u00a0for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.\u00a0 As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on\u00a026 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  As is the case in many other sectors of the economy, despite these Government supports, Covid-19 has resulted in significant financial pressures for public transport operators.\u00a0 As you will be aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway business operates on a commercial basis in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market. \u00a0Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020.\u00a0 This was a commercial decision by the company.\u00a0 The decision affects four routes:\u00a0\u00a0the Dublin\/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020): and services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and\u00a0Galway routes. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement public service obligation (PSO) service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfiguring to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Expressway ceased its\u00a0X12 Limerick\/Dublin route\u00a0with effect from Saturday\u00a030 January 2021.\u00a0 In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X12 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X12 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route. <\/p>  <p>  I understand no cessation date has been confirmed by the company for the X8 Cork\/Dublin or 20\/X20 Galway\/Dublin routes and these routes are continuing to operate with the temporary Government funding supports, albeit at a reduced level in line with the reduction in demand.\u00a0 The NTA will undertake similar examinations in respect of these corridors affected by Expressway&rsquo;s route consolidation process, to ensure there are no gaps in the network, and to assess if there is a need to provide any additional services. This will be done prior to these services ceasing operation.<\/p>  <p>  On a separate front, the Deputies may also wish to note that,\u00a0as part of the initiatives introduced in the Government's\u00a0announcment of a Stimulus Package last July, there will be a significant expansion of PSO bus services in several areas across the country.\u00a0 Among other things, this will involve\u00a0the taking on of 120 additional drivers\u00a0by Bus &Eacute;ireann, and will enable increased\u00a0bus services in Cork city centre, as well as more frequent services in Navan town, Drogheda, Limerick city, and counties Clare and Tipperary. <\/p>  <p>  Concerning\u00a0carbon emissions - a key objective of my Department\u00a0is to\u00a0secure an efficient and low emission public transport system. As public transport is responsible for less than 5% of our transport\u00a0emissions, in absolute terms, converting public transport fleets to low\u00a0carbon\u00a0alternatives will have a limited impact on national\u00a0emission\u00a0reductions. However, greening the public fleet does fulfil a strong leadership and demonstration role as we shift towards a low-carbon\u00a0economy. To this end, I am committed to continuing to green the public transport fleet, and to making each public transport journey less\u00a0carbon-intensive.<\/p>  <p>The national bus fleet, which carries the majority of public transport passengers, is already moving to lower emission alternatives.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.<\/p>  <p>  The NDP, as it stands, \u00a0does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network, but funding is not yet at the level needed\u00a0for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.\u00a0 For this reason, the primary focus for\u00a0capital investment continues to be \u00a0the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects. \u00a0Currently the NDP is under review and changes to project criteria could occur.<\/p>  <p>  Any road improvement project put forward for consideration must be appraised for compliance with the Public Spending Code as revised in December 2019. \u00a0An important change to the Public Spending Code is the introduction of a requirement for a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more.\u00a0 The SAR is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the SAR is to examine the rationale for a proposed project and to ensure the strategic alignment of projects with Government policy, including the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan. The SAR is also an important step in the project lifecycle in that potential alternatives for an intervention are assessed and identified for further appraisal should the project progress to the Preliminary Business Case phase of the appraisal process.<\/p>  <p>  As regards access to Cobh and Great Island, there was some initial engagement between Cork County Council and this Department in 2019, including a meeting with the \u00a0Department's Strategic Research and Analysis Division regarding the project appraisal process. Subsequent to that meeting,\u00a0Cork County Council decided \u00a0to appoint consultants to carry out a wider transport study which will look at all options in relation to access and I understand that the Council expects to appoint those consultants shortly.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the classification of the R624, the classification of roads as either a national road or a regional road is a Ministerial\u00a0responsibility\u00a0under section 10 of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended.\u00a0 A public road, other than one classified\u00a0 as a national road or a regional road, is a local road.<\/p>  <p>  Roads classified as National Primary or National Secondary are funded by the State and construction, improvement and maintenance works are overseen by TII, in conjunction with the relevant local authority, and funded mainly from voted monies.\u00a0 Roads classified as regional or local roads fall under the responsibility of local authorities. The construction, repair and maintenance of these roads is funded by local authorities&rsquo; own resources supplemented by State grants.<\/p>  <p>  Requests to classify a road as a national road or regional road are considered, in consultation with TII as appropriate.\u00a0 Criteria for consideration are numerous and include items such as function of road including access to towns and Cities, major ports and airports, geographical regions, population centres and tourist regions.\u00a0 It also includes considerations of continuity of classification throughout the length of road, whether roads are feeder connections or links to the national road network, cross section, alignment and structural integrity as well as amount of heavy commercial vehicles.\u00a0 \u00a0Funding source for road improvement is not a consideration of classification of road type.<\/p>  <p>  No decision has been taken to reclassify the R624 as a national road to date. Further consideration may be given to the issue as part of a future general review of road classifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300064#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300064#WRG02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300064#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[5130\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300064#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a response will issue to correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a social welfare payment for employees and self-employed people who have lost all their employment due to the COVID-19 public health emergency.\u00a0 As outlined from the outset, payments made under the PUP are income supports and subject to income tax.\u00a0 Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.\u00a0 In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the PUP are subject to income tax.\u00a0 The taxation arrangements reflect the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments and, thus, is exempt from the USC and PRSI charges.<\/p>  <p>  A &euro;13 exemption for Jobseekers' Benefit (JB) provided for in s. 126(4)(b) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA).

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up\u00a0to three months and then subsequently extended for\u00a0up to six months. The implementation of\u00a0this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a\u00a0flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The latest BPFI payment break update, to 31 December, reported that approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% have not returned to full repayment and are receiving other forms of lender support.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.\u00a0 The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.<\/p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.<\/p><p>In addition, Credit Review\u00a0https:\/\/www.creditreview.ie\u00a0was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.<\/p><p>Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that\u00a0lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers\u00a0in a timely manner\u00a0in line with\u00a0regulatory requirements.

As the Deputy\u00a0indicates I have called upon insurers to be pro-active and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance customers during the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, I would highlight\u00a0an expected\u00a0significant reduction in claims arising from the travel restrictions that have been in place. Last year saw a number of insurers announcing a range of forbearance measures and motor insurance rebates for policyholders.

Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing TWSS compliance programme is specifically examining that employers adhered to that requirement, as well as examining employer\/employee eligibility for the TWSS.<\/p>  <p>  In order to get much needed income supports into the hands of employees as quickly as possible, Revenue operated a transitional phase of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme until 3 May 2020. This transitional phase of the TWSS provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees.<\/p>  <p>  On 4 May 2020 Revenue moved to the operational phase of the TWSS, which included increased subsidy rates of up to 85%, subject to certain limits. During this phase of the scheme Revenue ensured that the subsidy refunded to employers was based on each individual employee&rsquo;s Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay (ARNWP), which was derived from an employee&rsquo;s average net earnings in January\/February 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that during the operational phase of the TWSS, the calculation of the subsidy payments to employers in respect of its employees based on the average net earnings of each employee during January\/February 2020 has optimised the payments to employers for the vast majority of its employees. However, Revenue publicly announced on 8 May 2020 that for a small number of employees who were higher income earners before the COVID 19 pandemic, because of the interaction between their gross and net earnings, an additional subsidy payment may be due.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue is currently in the process of identifying these employees, with a view to calculating any additional subsidy payment that may be due and will offset this amount against any undercharges of income tax and USC arising on their untaxed TWSS payments. This exercise is being done as part of Revenue&rsquo;s final reconciliation of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Reconciliation involves a comprehensive review by Revenue of the &lsquo;subsidy payable&rsquo; amount for each employee payslip, based on the rules of the TWSS. The total &lsquo;subsidy payable&rsquo; amounts will then be compared to the actual total amount paid to the employer under the scheme to identify any instances where the amounts reimbursed to employers may have been over or under paid. In order to complete the reconciliation process, employers must provide details of the wage subsidy they paid to their employees. To date, Revenue has already received &lsquo;subsidy paid&rsquo; data in respect of 94% of the 6 million payslips that were covered under the TWSS and is actively engaged with those employers who have yet to provide these details. Once all of the required information is available from TWSS reconciliation, the matter of calculating any additional subsidy payments to employees who may have such an entitlement and recalculating the tax and USC liability can be finalised. This process is likely to take several weeks to complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300065#WRH05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":560,"content":"<p>Question No. 197 answered with Question No. 164.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300065#WRH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[5610\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300065#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for a scheme (details supplied) from businesses in County Mayo; the number of applications approved; the amount of support paid out to those businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>Revenue has published detailed statistics on the main COVID-19 subsidy schemes since late March 2020, including the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.<\/p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19 and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be in difficulty for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance. The BPFI has also reiterated this January that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation. It is in the best long term interests of both the borrower and lender that engagement takes place in relation to a particular loan difficulty and that the most appropriate solution to the individual case is adopted as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19.

DPER has now forwarded submissions from the public consultation, and the EIAR and NIS reviews, to the OPW, along with a request for supplementary information, pursuant to ADA regulations 2019, to ensure that the design of the scheme complies with relevant environmental directives and regulations. <\/p>  <p>  The OPW, Wexford County Council, and scheme consultants Mott Mc Donald are currently compiling the supplementary information required, in order to formally respond to the points raised by the review of the scheme by DPER and their consultants.\u00a0 To this end the OPW has written to DPER indicating that the relevant information will be forwarded by the end of April 2021. DPER and their consultants will then need to review the material submitted with a view to confirming the scheme. It is not possible to provide a specific timeline for a formal decision regarding confirmation in advance of that. <\/p>  <p>  Completion of the above tasks and the progression of the flood relief scheme is a priority for all parties. In parallel with the confirmation process OPW and Wexford County Council have been working on the following to ensure as efficient progression of the works as possible once the scheme is confirmed; <\/p>  <p>  - the Foreshore licence application public consultation has been completed, approval expected mid 2021<\/p>  <p>  - a legal agreement with Irish Water for diversion of services has been agreed. The detailed design for these works is complete, and contractor tender documents are currently being reviewed prior to advertisement.<\/p>  <p>  - Technical approvals have been received from Irish Rail regarding the rail line crossings, with the legal agreement well advanced<\/p>  <p>  - Archaeological excavations are ongoing<\/p>  <p>  - Removal of invasive species (e.g. Japanese Knotweed) are ongoing<\/p>  <p>  - Pre-qualification of the bridgeworks contractor is almost complete, with a view to expediting contractor appointment post-confirmation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300066#WRJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300066#WRJ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[5826\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300066#WRJ05000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the date on which a Bill that will provide for the transposition of EU Directive (EU) 2019\/1937 also known as the EU whistleblowing directive will be introduced; if he will embark on pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill; and if this will occur in advance of the deadline for the transposition of this directive which is 17 December 2021.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[5827\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300066#WRJ05100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason the window of time for the consultation process given to the public to make submissions on EU Directive (EU) 2019\/1937 was limited by his Department to just a five week period between 8 June and 10 July in 2020; and his plans to accept further submissions.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":627,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together.<\/p>  <p>  Directive (EU) 2019\/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (also known as \"the Whistleblowing Directive\") was adopted on 23 October 2019 by the European Parliament and Council and must be transposed into Irish law by 17 December 2021.

This is an overall EU target and discussions around how this will be achieved are still ongoing; fair and transparent burden-sharing among member states is a crucial consideration in discussions around implementation of the Strategy at national\u00a0level.

A landlord or tenant might wish to seek independent legal advice in a particular case.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Section 34 of the Acts provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any tenancy termination notice served, and the termination will not be valid unless that reason relates to one of the following:<\/p>  <p>  -  the tenant has failed to comply with the obligations (other than the obligation to pay rent) of the tenancy;<\/p>  <p>  -  the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy;<\/p>  <p>  -  the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next 9 months;<\/p>  <p>  -  the dwelling is no longer suited to the needs of the occupying household;<\/p>  <p>  -  the landlord requires the dwelling for own or family member occupation;<\/p>  <p>  -  vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling; and\/or <\/p>  <p>  -  the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.<\/p>  <p>  Notices of termination can be served at this time but a termination cannot take effect until after 15 March 2021 (i.e. 10 days after the lifting of the current 5km restriction on travel from home) under the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, subject to certain exceptions.

The IOM is the leading inter-governmental organisation in the field of migration and works closely with governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental partners. Ireland is one of a small group of countries which provides unearmarked core funding support to IOM, giving the Organisation the flexibility to operate where needs are greatest.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the practical challenges it has posed for resettlement, the European Commission&rsquo;s new Pact on Migration and Asylum, released in September 2020, proposes to extend both the EU target quota of 30,000 as well as the ad hoc pledges Member States made for 2020 into 2021. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300070#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":896,"content":"<p>Question No. 319 answered with Question No. 317.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Aid","counter":897,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300070#WRN00700"},{"type":"question","counter":898,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[5330\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300070#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Irish and EU humanitarian assistance for Syria can be provided directly to Syrian and non-Syrian humanitarian and human rights organisations in order that priority will be given to projects that will enable Syrian refugees sustain themselves in the long term and defend their rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":899,"content":"<p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;168 million in humanitarian aid, including over &euro;25 million provided in 2020, to those affected by the conflict in Syria and the region.\u00a0 This is our largest ever response to any single crisis. Funding is provided through implementing organisations including non-governmental organisations, UN organisations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).<\/p>  <p>  Each of these partners has specific qualities, areas of focus, and comparative advantage that allows us to reach a broad range of recipients. Support through these partners meets the high levels of accountability and strict standards of propriety which are in place for all implementing organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Our key implementing partners in the Syria region are:<\/p>  <p>  -  The UN, which is often the lead actor in many major humanitarian crises, has a strong overview of overall needs, and coordinates the various actors involved in the response.<\/p>  <p>  -  The ICRC, whose speciality is working in conflict, and which is sometimes the only humanitarian actor present in some particularly challenging contexts.<\/p>  <p>  -  Irish NGOs, whose programmes are both addressing immediate life-saving needs of the most vulnerable communities affected by the Syria crisis and advocating for their protection from human rights abuses. <\/p>  <p>  Crucially, each of these partners works in close cooperation and partnership with local community organisations. For example, the UN&rsquo;s Syria Cross Border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF), to which Ireland provided &euro;2.5m in 2020, supports recipients that include Syrian and international NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movements and UN agencies. One of the Fund&rsquo;s key objectives is to maximise engagement with local, national and diaspora Syrian NGOs to ensure better access to the people in need. As a result, over the past few years, the SCHF has grown into a critical funding mechanism for Syrian NGOs with a large part of its funding allocated to local partners.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is a significant contributor to EU humanitarian budgets. Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s response.\u00a0 The EU has mobilised more than &euro;20 billion since 2012 for assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in the region. Since its establishment in 2014, a significant share of the EU's support for Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis.

In total, Ireland has contributed over &euro;28 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant humanitarian funding at the global level, including to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). In 2020, the CERF provided almost &euro;54 million in funding to Yemen. As an EU Member State, Ireland also contributes to the EU response to the crisis in Yemen. Since 2015, the EU has allocated over &euro;554 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300070#WRN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300070#WRN02300"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[5412\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300070#WRN02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has engaged with Her Excellency Ms Geraldine Byrne Nason on her work as chair of the Somalia sanctions committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>Ireland has a long history of engagement on Somalia, from our contribution to peacekeeping in the 1990s to today&rsquo;s participation in EU civilian capacity building missions and support to humanitarian response.

However budgetary changes that occurred in the UK in 2017 introduced a 25% tax charge, referred to as an overseas transfer charge, that can become payable in respect of the transferred funds to the QROPS schemes, under certain conditions. As part of these changes, managers of overseas pension schemes registering for QROPS are required to sign an undertaking that they would be jointly and severally liable for the overseas transfer charge, should it arise, along with the individual. This requirement of the UK tax authorities remains. \u00a0As a result of this change, and following DPER guidance, most Irish public service pension scheme did not (re)register for QROPS, as providing such an undertaking in respect of publicly funded Irish public service schemes effectively amounts to the State guaranteeing an individual&rsquo;s tax liability.

The pandemic has brought significant challenges to the education system, and I am acutely aware of the impacts that this has had on those students preparing to sit their final examinations. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  The planning work underway in respect of the State Examinations in 2021 is being assisted by an Advisory Group of key stakeholders which has met on a number of occasions in recent months. The advisory group has been convened to advise Government on all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.\u00a0 The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p>  <p>  At a meeting of the group on 22 January, the Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union presented its Report on the 2021 State Examinations and Return to School. Following this meeting, the group agreed that there would be an intensive set of engagements in respect of exploring further possible options for the examinations, having regard to the findings of the recent ISSU Report on the 2021 State Examinations. <\/p>  <p>  The sub-group exploring these options has since met on three occasions and has discussed further possible measures that could be taken to address the demands on students preparing for the examinations.\u00a0 Having regard to the impact of current school closures for face-to-face tuition, there was also discussion on the scope and form of assessment for the various examination components, written and non-written. <\/p>  <p>  All partners are committed to acting in the interests and well-being of students, who are at the heart of this process.<\/p>  <p>  A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Education also took place on 1 February which provided an opportunity for consideration of possible options prior to consideration by Government as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, have been engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.<\/p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the original closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.

It is important that pupils\/students move on with their peers and continue to the next stage of their education.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been much learning across the system in the 2019\/202 school year in relation to transitions and my Department is confident that the education system will use this knowledge to respond carefully to the needs of these children so that they can transfer successfully to age-appropriate, post-primary education in September 2021. <\/p><p>For example, primary schools will prepare children for transition to post-primary education.\u00a0 Primary teachers are working hard to prevent and address gaps in the learning of sixth class pupils. This is currently happening remotely and will be a priority also for teachers when the children return to the classroom. Focussing on children&rsquo;s well-being and resilience will also be priorities for teachers as they help their sixth class pupils prepare for the move to post-primary education.<\/p><p>Post-primary schools will also be keenly aware of the nature of the school experience of the children in 2020-21. Post-primary teachers will be in a position to respond with agility to the needs of the incoming first year students in 2021 and to set realistic, differentiated expectations for their learning.<\/p><p>The successful transfer of sixth class children to post-primary education in 2021 will require ongoing, collaboration and careful planning between primary schools and post-primary schools. This will happen at a local level through transition programmes involving meetings of the primary and post-primary teachers with the children and their parents as well as through the transfer of key information to the post-primary schools. The NEPS Continuum of Support and the Home School Liaison Officers in DEIS schools can also be utilised to support the transition of pupils.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Communication between the primary and post primary schools and with the parents and children is of utmost importance in order to ensure progression is as seamless as possible.

Under the CCMA, lending institutions are encouraging customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being. <\/p>  <p>  Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) on behalf of its members has recently stated that the industry continues to use a case by case approach to support those customers adversely impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic, with standard payment breaks offered as \u00a0part of the wide range of solutions provided to customers.\u00a0 The number of active payment breaks for Private Dwellings (PDH) mortgages continues to decline with only 2,000 PDH mortgage payment breaks currently active as at December 2020 (9,000 as at October 2020). <\/p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, also continues to provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.\u00a0 As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300073#WRQ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300073#WRQ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[5352\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300073#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an emergency supplementary social welfare payment can issue to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Basic payment is a short term emergency payment that can be made pending the award of the most appropriate primary payment, such as Jobseekers Allowance or Disability Allowance.\u00a0 If a person is fit for work, they should apply for a Jobseekers Allowance, and if a person is unfit for work due to illness or disability, they should apply for a Disability Allowance.\u00a0 Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance may then be\u00a0paid while the primary claim is being processed.\u00a0 An Exceptional Needs Payment is available to assist people with once off expenditure that is exceptional in nature and cannot be met from any other source.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that my Department has no record of receipt of an application for\u00a0any of the above payments\u00a0from the person concerned, including an Exceptional or Urgent Needs Payment.\u00a0 I have, however, made arrangements for a Designated Officer from our Community Welfare Services\u00a0to make urgent contact the customer in relation to the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300073#WRQ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300073#WRQ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1174,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[5363\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300073#WRQ05200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will consider a temporary change in the conditions for participants on community employment schemes by granting an additional year to current participants who cannot undertake a training programme due Covid-19 restrictions and given the difficulties experienced by scheme operators in recruiting new participants during this time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1175,"content":"<p>The Community Employment (CE) Scheme is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has continued to provide\u00a0funding and support for CE schemes since the onset of the\u00a0Covid-19 emergency\u00a0in March, 2020.

In addition to the information provided in this reply, my Office will arrange for responses to issue to the individuals concerned. <\/p>  <p>  In responding to the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation, the Government has approved the development of a Strategic Action Plan. The plan encompasses a comprehensive suite of 22 measures, which are intended to respond to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families.  Most importantly, we will take a survivor-centred approach in the development and implementation of these measures. The Action Plan centres on a number of distinct themes including: access to personal information; archiving and databases; education and research; memorialisation; dignified burial, and restorative recognition. <\/p>  <p>  This is a hugely important process for all connected to these institutions and I will be working with colleagues and survivors to advance these matters as a priority. The Government's Strategic Action Plan is now available to view on my Department's website at  www.gov.ie\/dcediy.  <\/p>  <p>  As a first step, an Interdepartmental Group  (IDG) has been established to develop proposals for a bespoke ex-gratia Restorative Recognition Scheme to provide financial recognition in respect of the issues examined by the Commission of Investigation.  I want the scheme to be designed as early as possible in 2021. The IDG is tasked with reporting by the end of April to enable specific proposals to be brought to Government. <\/p>  <p>  I have also prioritised the preparation of Information and Tracing legislation to give individuals the fullest possible access to their birth and early life information. The database and related records which were transferred recently from the Commission of Investigation to Tusla will greatly support timely access to such information in accordance with this proposed new legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the proposed developments at Bessborough, I understand the distress which the timing of this proposal has caused for those most centrally connected to this issue. I share their concerns in relation to the risks associated with this development. For these reasons, I made submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council asking that any decisions on the proposed development on the Bessborough site take appropriate account of the Commission&rsquo;s Interim and Final Reports and the wishes of survivors and the families of the children who died while resident in this institution. I understand that planning permission for one part of the development has been refused in recent days by Cork County Council.  <\/p>  <p>  While there are understandable questions in relation to the holding of inquests, it is important to acknowledge the independence of each Coroner in the discharge of their statutory functions in this regard.

Many of the issues highlighted in the survey, in particular the level of pay among those working in early learning and care (ELC)\u00a0and school-age childcare (SLC), are issues on which I have been actively engaging since becoming Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in ELC and SAC services. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. It also contributes to challenges of recruitment and retention of staff, which are key to the consistency of care provided to children. The risk of practitioners seeking to leave the sector is one that is highlighted in the SIPTU Big Start Campaign's 2020 survey. The most recent published data indicates that the average hourly wage in the sector was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department\u00a0does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff working in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions. However, wages in the sector remain too low. Given the importance of the issue, it is imperative that\u00a0my Department continues to engage with provider and staff representatives. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2020, working in partnership with SIPTU and CSI\/IBEC, I began a short process in which interested parties were invited to discuss how best to address issues of pay and conditions in the sector and how a Joint Labour Committee might support this.

Included in First 5 is a commitment to designing a new Funding Model to deliver additional funding to early learning and care and school-age childcare providers.<\/p><p>In September 2019, my predecessor announced the establishment of an Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model. The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The group is considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.<\/p><p>The Expert Group has met twelve times to date.<\/p><p>The Terms of Reference for the Expert Group include the need to review existing measures and to draw on international evidence on how to structure funding. To support this, Frontier Economics was selected to deliver a significant programme of research to the Expert Group. Frontier Economics has delivered the following research papers, which have been published:<\/p><p>1. Comparative and Contextual Analysis of ELC and SAC Fees, Staff Wages and Public Investment<\/p><p>2. International approaches to funding ELC<\/p><p>3. Review of working conditions for ELC and SAC staff<\/p><p>4. Potential mechanisms to control fees charged to parents<\/p><p>5. Approaches to identifying children and\/or services in need of additional support <\/p><p>Further papers, on disadvantage, quality and shared governance and collaboration, will be delivered and published shortly.<\/p><p>The Terms of Reference of the Expert Group also include the need for consultation and engagement with stakeholders in order to agree the principles to underpin the new Funding Model. The first phase of consultation and engagement took place between August and December\u00a02020. The consultation included a call for submissions, a parental poll, two webinars and a focused discussions with providers, practitioners and parents.\u00a0A report on key issues identified during the consultation will be published shortly. Further stakeholder engagement and consultation is scheduled for Q1 &amp;amp; Q2 2021.<\/p><p>Co-ordination with other significant reform projects planned for the sector in respect of Workforce Development and the Review of the Operating System is ongoing. A meeting between representatives of the Expert Group and the Workforce Development Plan Steering Group took place in January.<\/p><p>It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be submitted to the Minister in November 2021 for consideration before submission to wider Government.<\/p><p>Material relating to the Funding Model, including meeting papers, research papers, and reports, is available on a dedicated website,\u00a0www.first5fundingmodel.ie.\u00a0<\/p><p>First 5\u00a0also includes a number of commitments related to the workforce for ELC and SAC, including development of a Workforce Development Plan (WDP). The WDP is intended to set out plans to achieve the First 5 workforce commitments, including to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector. The Workforce Development Plan will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.<\/p><p>Specific objectives include: <\/p><p>- To achieve a graduate-led (50%) workforce by 2028 for early learning and care.<\/p><p>- All regulated childminders will hold a minimum qualification.<\/p><p>- All regulated school-age childcare staff will hold a minimum qualification.<\/p><p>After a period of extensive public consultation on the subject of qualifications standards for childminding and school-age childcare in late 2020, the Workforce Development Plan will focus on the creation of pathways towards reaching an appropriate qualification standard for both, recognising their unique backgrounds and requirements.<\/p><p>Phase one of development of the WDP involved the drafting of an interim report. This report is being finalised before publication in the near future. Phase two will involve detailed implementation plans to be prepared by a number of working groups throughout 2021. <\/p><p>The WDP Stakeholder Group, consisting of a wide range of different voices involved in the sector, has been consulted on each piece of work to date and has provided valuable insights informing policy developments and the consultation process.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A programme of consultation on draft proposals on the WDP was rolled out, consisting of: <\/p><p>- A call for submissions, which ran from 19 August to 2 October, for all involved in the sector to have their say. <\/p><p>- Webinars on 22 September and 16 December informed the sector of work to date on the project and important details relating to the consultation process. <\/p><p>- A series of nine consultation events involving focussed discussions with practitioners over two weeks from the 12 to 23 of October. The themes of these discussions were recruitment and retention, qualifications and initial training and ongoing training and CPD. <\/p><p>The feedback from the consultation process informed the drafting of the interim report, which is due to be published in early 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300077#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[6020\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300077#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the actions he has taken to date to progress the establishment of a joint labour committee in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, sector.

These engagements will facilitate a dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care. \u00a0<\/p><p>Students should continue to engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300077#WRU02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1469,"content":"<p>Question No. 521 answered with Question No. 519.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Admissions","counter":1470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300077#WRU02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1471,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[5078\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300077#WRU03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students who opted to defer their studies in the 2020-2021 academic year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes.<\/p><p>Under the Department's Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses (including medicine courses). In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including previous education attainment.<\/p><p>Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. <\/p><p>However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA.

They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees to be charged in the case of GEM fees are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.<\/p><p>There is no Department supported loan scheme in place for GEM students.

The next stage of engagement will take place\u00a0following the publication of the General Scheme of the Bill\u00a0later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will\u00a0be aware,\u00a0responsibility for addiction treatment rests with my colleague the Minister\u00a0of Health. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300078#WRV04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Liquor Licences","counter":1568,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300078#WRV04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1569,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[5212\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300078#WRV04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to progress legislation on alcohol licensing in view of the upsurge in drink deliveries due to the Covid-19 pandemic.","asker":"1453","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1570,"content":"<p>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to modernise our licensing laws and application processes and this is under consideration in my department.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the concerns that people have in relation to the purchase for delivery of alcohol products and I am very conscious of the detrimental effects of alcohol dependency on families and society. <\/p>  <p>  While there is no dedicated licence for online sales of intoxicating liquor, licensees of licensed premises may engage in online sales subject to certain restrictive conditions.<\/p>  <p>  As matters stand, under existing legislation where alcohol is purchased online, the same restrictions on the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor apply, including the restrictions in relation to hours of trading and the provisions in relation to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to young persons. <\/p>  <p>  Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so. <\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, makes provision for offences relating to the sale and delivery of alcohol products to persons under the age of 18 years. It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is substantial existing legislation to regulate the delivery of alcohol services in Ireland. However, I do appreciate that, with the Covid-19 outbreak, habits of consumers have been affected and the share of purchases online has increased. These changes may be temporary or they may be the beginning of longer term trends. It is perhaps too early to tell what impacts these changes may have and whether increased online sales and delivery of alcohol will, on balance, provide increased convenience and choice to consumers or have negative impacts on society that require further regulation. I intend to keep the matter under review and will consider it further in the context of the wider\u00a0reform of licensing law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300078#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":1571,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300078#WRV04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1572,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[5215\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300078#WRV04900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prosecutions and arrests under legislation regulating learner drivers in tabular form.","asker":"1453","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1573,"content":"<p>I have requested a Garda report on the figures requested by the Deputy.

Last March, in partnership with the NGO sector, we launched the &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; awareness campaign, to ensure those at risk of domestic abuse throughout the pandemic are aware that supports remain available regardless of the level of restrictions in place. In October, I published Supporting A Victims Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, which is a detailed roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley review. A key action of the plan is to increase public awareness of the rights of victims of crime, and of the supports and services available to them. This will be done through the promotion of the Victims Charter, including by the redesign of the Victims Charter website, which will be launched shortly. <\/p><p>The Government is also committed to ensuring adequate resources for the courts in order to maintain access to justice for all citizens. This commitment was reinforced recently with the highest ever budgetary allocation for the Justice sector including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service. This included &euro;8 million for the new Courts Modernisation Programme along with an additional provision of &euro;5.7m for COVID measures to enable court sittings take place in a socially distanced and safe environment. A significant priority for my Department and the Courts Service in the years ahead will be to significantly invest in digital technology, to transform the experience of practioners and of court users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300079#WRW04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":1638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300079#WRW04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1639,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[5580\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300079#WRW04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of courts and the location of each in which audio-visual technology was installed in 2020 to facilitate remote hearings; the spend involved; the payments to companies that installed the technology; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1640,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in its functions. <\/p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Courts Service.\u00a0They have\u00a0informed me that\u00a0all of the payments for the audio-visual technology to support remote hearings were made to Fitting Image Ltd. who were the successful candidate following a procurement competition.

Therefore, I am satisfied that the existing laws of the State can cater for most if not all scenarios. Additionally, section 3(2) (a) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) provides that a deportation order may be made in respect of a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in the State.\u00a0 It is also important to point out that any person being considered for deportation, or indeed for a permission to remain in the State, will have their case considered under a variety of headings, all prescribed in law. <\/p>  <p>  Such factors to be considered will invariably include &lsquo;the character and conduct&rsquo; of the person both within and (where relevant and ascertainable) outside the State, including criminal convictions. This position is prescribed in both section 3(6)(g) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and section 49(3)(c) of the International Protection Act 2015. This assessment will have regard for whether the person in question has come to adverse Garda attention and any other matters of &lsquo;character and conduct&rsquo; which are material to the consideration of the individual case.<\/p>  <p>  Where a third country national\u00a0has\u00a0disrespected the laws of the State, it will certainly be a factor in consideration of their removal from the State, all other things being equal.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to people seeking international protection who commit a crime, this may or not be material to their international protection claim.\u00a0 However, if\u00a0a person commits a serious crime in their country of origin, this can form a basis for having them &lsquo;excluded&rsquo; from being declared a refugee or from gaining subsidiary protection status in the State. Nevertheless, any person seeking international protection who commits a crime in the State will have their protection application determined on its merits under domestic and international law. A person granted refugee status can also\u00a0have their status revoked in certain prescribed circumstances, as set out in section 52 of the International Protection Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Permission to remain in the State is typically granted at\u00a0the discretion of the Minister. Therefore, there is scope for having such a permission revoked, amended or not renewed, on grounds of criminality. Each\u00a0case will be considered on its own merits and circumstances and fair procedures will be applied. However, it can be taken that the greater the sanction imposed by a Court in the State for a crime committed in the State, the greater\u00a0the public interest will be in having their\u00a0permission revoked, amended or not renewed and ultimately, following due process, having them removed from the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300079#WRW07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1666,"content":"<p>Question No. 593 answered with Question No. 571.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Inquiries","counter":1667,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300079#WRW07200"},{"type":"question","counter":1668,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[5867\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300079#WRW07300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the rationale for the decision taken on five different occasions to extend the scoping exercise being undertaken relevant to the inquiry into the death of a person (details supplied); if she will request that the exercise be completed by 1 March 2021; if she will give consideration to the demand for a full, wide-ranging public inquiry as supported by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in June 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1669,"content":"<p>As the\u00a0Deputy will be aware, a retired Judge, Gerard Haughton, is currently conducting the scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of the late Shane O'Farrell. <\/p>  <p>  Judge Haughton furnished an interim report to my predecessor in November 2019. In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department recently received a letter from Judge Haughton updating the Department on his progress. In this correspondence, the Judge requested a further extension of the timeline to\u00a01\u00a0March\u00a02021, and set out a clear and detailed rationale for this extension.\u00a0 I understand from Judge Haughton that he provided a copy of this letter to the O'Farrell family and I have also written to the family to inform them of the extension.<\/p>  <p>  The Judge is of course completely independent in his work, and as Minister I can neither intervene in nor direct the course of the scoping exercise.\u00a0My\u00a0Department has been and continues to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge to enable him to complete his work, and the extensions have, as the Judge has\u00a0stated to the family, been necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Judge's desire to be as comprehensive as possible in conducting the scoping exercise.<\/p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret this further delay, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible and this requires additional time. With regard to any further extensions, the Judge is of course completely independent in his work on this scoping exercise, and I cannot intervene in the process, nor can I place any restrictions on the Judge. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the\u00a0passing of a D&aacute;il resolution in June 2018 calling for a public inquiry into the events surrounding the incident in which Shane O&rsquo;Farrell tragically lost his life, my predecessor as Minister initiated\u00a0this scoping exercise to examine various matters. This is a reasonable and responsible approach to take. There are various precedents of scoping exercises being carried out prior to the setting up of inquiries or tribunals. A scoping exercise by a legal expert, to determine the net issues that might require further examination, is an exercise to ensure the success and completeness of any future action taken following the outcome of the scoping exercise.<\/p>  <p>  Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of recommendations for immediate implementation and a number of other complex issues that were deemed to require more detailed consideration. One such recommendation was the need to undertake a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and,<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the NTPF's pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. There is considerable complexity in both the review and the potential scope of its implementation, which would interact with a broad range of policy initiatives and potential legislative developments that are taking place across the health and social care sectors. These complexities require a considered, integrated approach by the Department and its stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Pricing Review was completed and some preliminary consideration of it was provided by the NTPF to the then Minister in late 2019. Given the complexities involved and the potential far reaching impacts, including in relation to access to care for citizens, it was determined that further briefing and consultation would be required before the Ministers could consider the range of issues and complexities involved.<\/p>  <p>  As the pandemic arose in early 2020, the Department has prioritised focus on supporting nursing homes and nursing home residents, noting the significant impact that COVID-19 has on such services and service users. A number of COVID-19 specific policy responses have been developed and implemented, including a Temporary Financial Support Scheme for private and voluntary nursing homes, which has paid out almost &euro;67m to date in respect of 2020 and made a further &euro;42m available up to the end of June 2021; supply of PPE on a free of charge basis; professional and expert advice, including clinical advice;\u00a0 a series of serial testing programmes in nursing homes; access to a comprehensive package of training resources; redeployment of HSE staff to private nursing homes; and staff accommodation for nursing home workers. However, the importance of addressing long-term policy consideration with regard to the pricing mechanism is acknowledged. Minister Donnelly and I are currently considering the content of the review and the appropriate next steps. <\/p>  <p>  Separate to the pricing review, the Department of Health has proposed a specific policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to cap contributions based on family owned and operated farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. This change has been approved by Government and undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family owned and operated farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.<\/p>  <p>  Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have exchanged letters with the Business Committee requesting a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.\u00a0It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1719,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1720,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[4997\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures that will be implemented to improve the delivery of health services in counties Cavan and Monaghan; if consideration will be given to the issues outlined in correspondence (details supplied); the estimated timescale for an improved range of services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1721,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Medical Services Scheme","counter":1722,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1723,"qnumday":612,"qnumall":"[5004\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if persons from the Republic of Ireland currently staying in Northern Ireland and unable to return home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions can have their GMS prescription costs in Northern Ireland reimbursed by the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1724,"content":"<p>As the reimbursement of health expenses whilst on a temporary stay abroad is an operational matter, this PQ has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p><p>Separately, in light of the Pandemic individuals seeking to access health services should consult the relevant public health guidance and restrictions in place in the relevant jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1725,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1726,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[5012\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300080#WRX04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will clarify and address the fact that persons with cerebral palsy have been listed by the HSE in the high-risk category in respect of Covid-19 but do not appear as a high-priority group in the vaccination schedule; if it will be ensured that persons with cerebral palsy will receive priority in the roll-out of vaccinations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1727,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.

To date, validation work indicates that ADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. Validation studies, both here in Ireland and in Europe are showing significant disparities in test performance (particularly in relation to sensitivity) versus some manufacturer claims, with tests not meeting minimum performance requirements set by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Furthermore, their intended use is typically in symptomatic individuals in the early stages of infection, where samples are taken and tests conducted by trained health professionals. There is limited performance data currently available for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic populations. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic individuals is much better than in asymptomatic individuals where data are available.<\/p>  <p>  The NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) considers the use of ADTs on an ongoing basis and has endorsed recommendations on the use of ADTs that have been validated as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.<\/p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300083#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1961,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300083#WRAA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1962,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[5309\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300083#WRAA03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funding allocated for mental health services by CHO area in each of the years 2016 to 2020;

This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources\u00a0are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.<\/p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of December 2020 there were 4,095 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,440 in December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an Access to Care Fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and &euro;30m to the NTPF for the provision of treatment as required in both private and public hospitals in order to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are continuously\u00a0reviewing waiting lists with a view to ensuring that services for scheduled care\u00a0are\u00a0resumed as soon as it is deemed\u00a0safe to do so\u00a0in line with HSE clinical guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Closures","counter":2009,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2010,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[5358\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital, Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary is due to close (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2011,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE National Service Plan","counter":2012,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2013,"qnumday":715,"qnumall":"[5362\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the HSE National Service Plan 2021 will be published; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2014,"content":"<p>The HSE formally submitted the 2021 National Service Plan on the 24th November, 2020 for my approval.<\/p><p>I initially responded to the HSE on 15<sup>th<\/sup>December, 2020 with the requirement to include the COVID vaccination strategy that had been launched since the receipt of the Plan.

Vaccination of this group will begin in February (subject to regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine).\u00a0 <\/p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.<\/p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2047,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB04900"},{"type":"question","counter":2048,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[5401\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300084#WRBB05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department will provide specific guidelines in relation to Covid-19 for private dental practices in terms of personal protective equipment, cross-infection and which aerosol-generating procedures are deemed essential; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2049,"content":"<p>My Department has worked\u00a0with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) to provide\u00a0evidence-based advice and guidance on infection control for the public and healthcare professionals throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.

One of the first tasks of the NIMC, in conjunction with the HSE Implementation Group, will be to ascertain ongoing Sharing the Vision aligned tasks and projects. This work is very much at an early stage. To date, the Steering Committee has met twice, on 11 December 2020 and on 15 January 2021, with meetings scheduled to take place monthly. The minutes of the Steering Committee meetings are available on the Department of Health Website.<\/p>  <p>  In these early stages, the Steering Committee will focus on developing and establishing the structures and processes crucial to a full and successful implementation of the new policy. \u00a0I am satisfied that the Committee is progressing well in this initial stage of its work, by building on the following initiatives already underway:  <\/p>  <p>  - Many significant recent developments in online mental health service provision and positive mental health promotion have been expedited in the advent of COVID-19. These initiatives exemplify the holistic, whole-of-population approach to mental health service development that Sharing the Vision will be promoting and seeking to advance, in parallel with the development of specialist supports.<\/p>  <p>  - Sharing the Vision recommends the continued implementation of the existing National Clinical Programmes in mental health, including Dual Diagnosis, Early Intervention in psychosis, and Mental Health and Intellectual Disability, by specifying the need for their continued phased implementation and evaluation. The Clinical Programmes are at the heart of service improvement, providing clear pathways in addressing a number of mental health conditions, to ensure strategic, standardised, and evidence-based delivery of services and better outcomes for service users and their families. The Clinical Programmes are currently in various stages of design and implementation. <\/p>  <p>  - Furthermore, to address the issue of funding, I secured an additional &euro;50 million for mental health services in 2021, bringing the annual budget to &euro;1,076 billion. &euro;23 million of this is dedicated to commencing implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision. \u00a0This includes establishing the new structures required to implement the policy, and the expansion of the clinical care programmes outlined above.<\/p>  <p>  - It will also fund additional mental health bed capacity, enhanced resources for Community Mental Health Teams, CAMHS Hubs\/Teams, Adult Crisis Resolution Services, increased supports in employment, Peer Support Workers, Bereavement Co-ordinator, and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which are specific short term recommendations in the new Policy. Work is progressing in these areas, including the recruitment of the 153 new mental health staff provided for, through 2021 development funding. <\/p>  <p>  - Sharing the Vision additionally recommends that, in keeping with the evolving understanding of human rights to empower people and improve quality of care in mental healthcare facilities, legislation must be updated, and additional supports put in place. As the Deputy may be aware, this is currently being addressed in the review of the\u00a0Mental Health Act, 2001\u00a0which is undergoing a major overhaul, with draft heads of the new bill expected to be published in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300085#WRCC07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","counter":2154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300085#WRCC07200"},{"type":"question","counter":2155,"qnumday":763,"qnumall":"[5538\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300085#WRCC07300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 446 of 10 December 2020 and 931 of 13 January 2021, the number and category of staff to be recruited to serve Dublin 9 and 11 (details supplied);

However, this is very much based on the normal use of medicines. There is no need for healthcare professionals to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. Similarly, patients and the general public are asked not to seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements.

The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than for registration boards for some other professions, owing to the different and complex entry paths into these professions, the variety of titles used and the variety and number of courses and course providers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Board is now undertaking the substantial work required to open the registers for counsellors and psychotherapists. This work includes consideration of titles to be protected and minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners applying for registration in the transitional period and for future graduates. Given the complexity of this work there is not yet a date for the opening of the registers.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to access to counselling services in the community,\u00a0in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, Sharing the Vision envisages an increasing role for the primary care sectors which, if appropriately resourced and with appropriate governance, can provide a comprehensive range of interventions. A core component of this is increasing access to counselling and talk therapies. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 16 of Sharing the Vision proposes that access to a range of counselling supports and talk therapies in the community\/primary care sector should be available on the basis of identified need so that all individuals, across the lifespan, with a mild-to-moderate mental health difficulty can receive prompt access to accessible care through their GP\/Primary Care Centre. Counselling supports and talk therapies must be delivered by appropriately qualified and accredited professionals. Recommendation 31 proposes that the potential for digital health solutions to enhance service delivery and empower service users should be developed.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to implementation, the recently established National Implementation Monitoring Committee (NIMC) for Sharing the Vision will oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the policy and monitor progress.\u00a0 The NIMC is supported by a Reference Group of Service Users and Families and the NIMC Specialist Groups.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also establishing an implementation group, one of the first tasks of which will be to ascertain ongoing Sharing the Vision aligned tasks and projects.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to ongoing HSE projects aligned to Sharing the Vision, HSE Mental Health commenced a service improvement project in January 2018 to ensure greater consistency and equity of access to talk therapies, with a view to developing a Model of Care for adults who attend specialist mental health services accessing talking therapies. While the project focuses specifically on adults attending specialist mental health services, it also describes other services where talk therapies are currently provided from HSE funding. <\/p>  <p>  Building on a stepped care approach, the Model of Care is expected to involve an assessment of the need for talking therapies taking into account stakeholder perspectives and the prevalence of mental health difficulties within the adult population. It will consider evidence-based talking therapies best-suited to meet the identified needs and outline a recommended operational model for talking therapies provided by General Adult Community Mental Health Teams. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, it is important to recognise that the development of any recommended operational model would be a substantial and complex process, with numerous steps and issues to be worked through, as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, many significant recent developments in online mental health service provision have been expedited in the advent of Covid 19. These initiatives are early and necessary examples of the sort of holistic, whole of population approach to mental health service development that Sharing the Vision will be promoting and seeking to advance, in line with the development of specialist supports.  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300088#WRFF04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Promotion","counter":2372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300088#WRFF04800"},{"type":"question","counter":2373,"qnumday":839,"qnumall":"[5754\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300088#WRFF04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of Healthy Ireland funding allocated to local authorities; the level of oversight by his Department to ensure associated infrastructure was provided; the amount of funding that was carried forward from these years that was unspent; if funds were returned by local authorities in each of the years 2018 to 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2374,"content":"<p>Pobal administers the Healthy Ireland Fund (HIF) on behalf of the Department of Health.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been designated as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price(s) that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to NHSS residents. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function and negotiates with a nursing home on an individual basis. The Minister for Health does not have any role in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The price agreed with the NTPF covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the <\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service<\/p>  <p>  The amount that a resident pays as their contribution to care is individual to that resident and is calculated based on the financial assessment of their means only.<\/p>  <p>  However, although the NHSS covers core living expenses as above, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers, hairdressing, and some therapies. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.\u00a0 In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.\u00a0 Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.\u00a0 The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300089#WRGG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff","counter":2425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300089#WRGG02100"},{"type":"question","counter":2426,"qnumday":858,"qnumall":"[5864\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300089#WRGG02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of psychotherapists employed directly in the HSE; the educational criteria required for psychotherapists to work for the HSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2427,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300089#WRGG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300089#WRGG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2429,"qnumday":859,"qnumall":"[5865\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300089#WRGG02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the pandemic intersectoral and international policy unit in his Department; when this unit was established; the number of staff in the unit; the aims and actions of the unit; the cost of the unit; if minutes are available to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2430,"content":"<p>The pandemic intersectoral and international policy unit was established in September 2020 to support the\u00a0co-ordinated approach to COVID-19 issues.

The potential benefits of energy efficiency measures include improved physical health such as reduced symptoms of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, rheumatism, arthritis and allergies, as well as fewer injuries. In cold climates, energy efficiency improvements can lower rates of excess winter mortality.<\/p>  <p>  Recent evidence shows that chronic thermal discomfort and fuel poverty also have negative mental health impacts (anxiety, stress, and depression). Energy efficiency improvements targeting fuel poverty can therefore improve mental, as well as physical well-being. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to providing &euro;5 billion to part fund a socially progressive national retrofit programme targeting all homes, but with a particular focus on the Midlands region and on social and low-income tenancies. Budget 2021 provided &euro;109 million to support lower income households to retrofit their homes and participate in the transition.\u00a0 This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme is a major pilot initiative delivered under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty and the Healthy Ireland Framework.\u00a0 This pilot scheme, which was launched in 2016 with a &euro;20m investment, is led by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in collaboration with the Department of Health, and has been delivered by the HSE and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in HSE Community Healthcare Organisation 7 (CHO7). <\/p>  <p>  The scheme has targeted deep energy efficiency interventions at people in energy poverty who are suffering from acute health conditions and living in poorly insulated homes. By retrofitting homes, the Warmth and Wellbeing pilot scheme aims to improve their internal air temperature and air quality, producing an improved quality of life for residents, reducing their energy bills and reducing impact on the health service through less frequent doctor\/hospital visits.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0An independent research project will take place in 2021 with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), following standard procurement processes.

The issue of isolation in rural and urban communities\u00a0cuts across the work of a number of Departments, and this is reflected in ongoing work on community policing, rural transport and social inclusion, among other areas.<\/p>  <p>  Many of my Department's policies and funding programmes aim to address\u00a0isolation issues in communities, and also deliver benefits by responding to the challenges facing vulnerable\u00a0individuals due to COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  The National Social Enterprise Policy aims to enable social enterprises increase their social, environmental and economic impact. Many social enterprises are based in rural or isolated areas and provide services to communities that may not otherwise be available. They also operate in our cities and other urban areas, often providing services to disadvantaged communities.<\/p>  <p>Physical and social isolation can have a significant impact on people living in rural areas. My Department is finalising a new rural development policy for the next five years, which will build on the progress achieved through the Action Plan for Rural Development, which concluded in 2019. The policy will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural communities and will identify policy measures for delivery in order to achieve these objectives.<\/p>  <p>Other key interventions include funding the Seniors Alert Scheme, which\u00a0enables\u00a0older people to live securely, with peace of mind, in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms, ensuring\u00a0contact is maintained with\u00a0those who are vulnerable. In addition, as part of the Department&rsquo;s COVID-19 Action Plan  , increased support was provided for older people through our funding partnership with ALONE for their crisis telephone support line and follow-on practical supports for those who need it.<\/p>  <p>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is Ireland&rsquo;s primary social inclusion funding intervention, delivered locally by Local Development Companies (LDCs) to help those in the greatest need access supports to enable participation in communities.\u00a0SICAP workers have extensive local connections and in-depth knowledge of available resources and supports and are continuing to work to ensure the emerging needs of their localities are responded to.<\/p>  <p>  Local Development Companies\u00a0(LDCs) have put in place various measures to ensure SICAP supports continue to be\u00a0delivered and that vulnerable people continue to be supported throughout the COVID-19 crises, examples as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Online supports are\u00a0delivered via telephone, email, Zoom, etc., with LDCs providing additional support to individuals with limited access to technology, in the form providing them with laptops\/tablets and upskilling them in their usage. <\/p>  <p>- LDCs\u00a0that\u00a0operate a &ldquo;friendly call&rdquo; service to elderly people saw an\u00a0increase in demand for the service with some LDCs mobilizing\u00a0 local\u00a0community groups to become involved in making regular contact\u00a0with older, vulnerable isolated people during COVID. <\/p>  <p>  - LDCs\u00a0supported an increase in demand for Meals on Wheels services and foodbanks, particularly for those not able to travel to shops and those experiencing\u00a0food poverty. <\/p>  <p>  - Other\u00a0responses included Pharmacy &amp;amp; Shopping Services; Employment and\u00a0Self-Employment Supports; Supports to Community Groups; Online Training;\u00a0Health, Well-Being and Social Prescribing; Mental Health\u00a0Supports. <\/p>  <p>  - My\u00a0Department offered every flexibility to the Local Development Companies (LDCs) which freed up SICAP workers to focus on a community response to the crisis. Given their presence in local communities, the LDC response to\u00a0the crisis was rapid and widespread with many of their 170,000 service\u00a0users reached in the early days and weeks of the crisis.<\/p>  <p>Volunteering   is also very much at the forefront of initiatives of this nature and the Department will continue to support volunteering both by the provision of funding and other supports, and the implementation of the recently published National Volunteering Strategy. <\/p>  <p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) funding will ensure that remote areas, particularly those that are likely to wait longest for connections, are provided with access to high-speed broadband in their communities while waiting for the National Broadband Plan roll-out to reach them. <\/p>  <p>The 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme (T&amp;V)\u00a0was tailored to help rural towns and villages respond to the challenges presented by COVID-19.

Under the two measures, some &euro;25.8 million was approved for a total of 510 projects across the country.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to monitor the adequacy of these supports to address isolation during the coming months.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300093#WRLL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dog Licences","counter":2761,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300093#WRLL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2762,"qnumday":974,"qnumall":"[5970\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021020300093#WRLL03300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if she will address a matter (details supplied) regarding dog ownership; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2763,"content":"<p>The overall intention of dog control legislation is to place the onus on dog owners and those in control of dogs to act responsibly by keeping their dogs under effectual control.
