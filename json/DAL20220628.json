Amy Broadhurst is the International Boxing Association, IBA, light welterweight champion of the world, Dearbhla Tinnelly is the youth light heavyweight European champion and Evelyn Igharo is the current Irish elite champion at 70 kg.  They are joined by coach Jim O'Neill from the Clann Naofa boxing club in Muirhevnamore in Dundalk.  These women are trailblazers.  They were around the House.  Members met them and we were all a bit star-struck.  Well done and keep at it.  I also see some of the Muslim Sisters of &Eacute;ire here.  They are also most welcome.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle.<\/p><p>There are just three weeks left in this D&aacute;il term, three weeks for the Government to see sense and introduce an emergency budget to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.  If the Government does not intervene now, many households will be pushed over the edge because they are on the brink today.  They simply cannot wait for October for budget 2023.  The crisis is getting worse, as the Taoiseach knows.  Yesterday, the Central Bank of Ireland reported that one third of families are just making ends meet.  This is up from one quarter of families in January.  The supermarket analyst company, Kantar, has stated that the sharp increases could add &euro;453 to the average annual grocery bill.  Again, this is a jump of &euro;100 on the company's estimate from last month.<\/p><p>Workers and families, as the Taoiseach knows, are finding it increasingly difficult just to afford the basics and are struggling to put a roof over their heads, food on the table, fuel in the car and clothes on their kids' backs.  Esther Pugh is the manager of the Barnardos centre in Loughlinstown.  What she told the media yesterday encapsulates the situation.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... we would have children coming into the service wearing their pyjamas for day clothes, and specifically bought to be day clothes...  The big worry is electricity running out - families don't have money to run their washing machine and tumble dryers.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>I have worked in Barnardos for a long number of years and what I am seeing now is the kind of deprivation we would have seen back in the '80s.  It is bad - there is no point saying otherwise. <\/blockquote>  <p>These are heartbreaking words, as I am sure the Taoiseach will agree, and they capture everyday life for so many families now.  We are now at a point where having a full-time job is not a guaranteed protection against the sharp edge of this crisis.  Some households with two incomes are really struggling, so what hope and what chance do those on low pay have?  We know that international factors are at play.  We accept that.  We also know, however, that this cost-of-living crisis is a catastrophe for our society.  I have been contacted by parents who are worried that they are raising their children now for emigration.<\/p> <p>I have been contacted by young people who do not want to leave but have their bags packed for Canada and Australia.  They say they cannot afford a life at home.  That is the terrible vista again of forced emigration looming for us.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; teaghlaigh i ndeireadh na feide.  Anocht, iarrfaidh r&uacute;n Shinn F&eacute;in ar an Rialtas buis&eacute;ad &eacute;igeand&aacute;la a thabhairt isteach.

Tonight, Sinn F&eacute;in will bring a motion to the D&aacute;il that will call on the Government to introduce an emergency budget to deliver and extend cost-of-living supports for workers and families.  We should not have to bring this motion but the Government has buried its head on what is a state of emergency for households.  I call on every Deputy to support this motion.  I want all of us to work together to ensure that people get the relief they need so badly and as a matter of urgency.  The truth is the Government cannot clock off in three weeks' time and leave families fighting to stay afloat.  That would be wholly wrong.  We need an emergency budget and the workers and families of Ireland need it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656421500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming and congratulating our boxing heroes, Amy, Dearbhla and Evelyn.  Boxing has brought great honour to Irish sport throughout the decades and continues to do so.  We pay tribute to the coaching fraternity and our boxing community.  Well done to Jim O'Neill and his team.  It is fantastic the degree to which young people are encouraged and nurtured through the great sport of boxing.<\/p>  <p>  Like everyone in this House, we are deeply concerned about the enormous cost pressures and impact of the current inflationary cycle on people, households and workers.  I make it very clear that the Government and I are absolutely determined to deal comprehensively with this.  Putin has waged a war first and foremost on the people of Ukraine through ongoing murder and terror, as witnessed in yesterday's appalling and inhumane bombing of a shopping centre with 18 innocent civilians killed.  In parallel with this, Putin has deliberately and premeditatedly created an energy war, an energy crisis, through withholding supplies, causing a massive increase in the price of energy across Europe and the world.  Likewise, on migration, he is creating the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War through the terror of bombing towns and villages, forcing Ukrainians to flee their lands, with the internal displacement of about 7 million people.  In addition, through the weaponisation of food, he is creating a famine to add to the challenges Africa is already experiencing.  That is the context and background; it is a very real one.  At the meeting of the Council of the European Union last week, very real concerns were raised about what the winter will bring if gas is cut off fully by Russia from the rest of Europe, particularly the major states that use Russian gas.  That is now a very real prospect.  That has already happened in quite a number of states.<\/p>  <p>  This is not something we can chase month by month.  There has to be a comprehensive response that gets us through the entirety of next winter in particular.  It is a response that has to take on board pay.  There have been discussions between public service unions and the Government.  There have been settlements in the private sector in the past while and those will continue.  In relation to that, tax has to be dealt with.  The expenditure profile of every Department has to be dealt with, which is very much linked to the cost-of-living issue, in the context of issues such as childcare and health care costs and so forth.  The idea of doing something in an isolated silo way is just not the correct response.  It has to embrace pay, expenditure, tax and a specific cost-of-living package that would apply in this calendar year to meet the challenges people face.<\/p>  <p>  It is wrong to say, as the Sinn F&eacute;in motion states, that the Government has done nothing or to condemn what the Government has done.  The Government has increased the fuel allowance, for example, by 55% or &euro;404.  That is a measure we have already introduced.<\/p> <p>About &euro;2.4 billion in measures have been allocated to the cost-of-living issue.  The Government cut taxes and increased social welfare rates in the budget last October.  Since then, through measures in February and beyond, we have also reduced excise duty on petrol, diesel and green diesel, saving motorists between &euro;9 and &euro;12 each time they fill their tanks.  We have reduced VAT on gas and electricity bills from 13.5% to 9%.  We have also given a &euro;200 energy credit to every single household across the country.  We have cut the annual public service obligation, PSO, levy from &euro;52 to minus &euro;75.  We have launched a national retrofitting scheme.  We have introduced new grant rates that will cover about 80% of the typical cost of attic and wall insulation.  We have put caps on school transport fees for families.  We have cut public transport fares by 20%, with an additional 50% cut in fares for young people.  We have lowered the threshold for the drugs payment scheme.<\/p> <p> It is therefore just not fair or balanced to say the Government has done nothing.  What we need is a comprehensive package, which we are working on and which we will deliver for people to alleviate the undoubted pressures that are on people at the moment and that will be there right throughout the winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656421800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>For all of what the Taoiseach has recited on his list, Esther Pugh of the Barnardos centre in Loughlinstown has told the story of what is happening on the ground and the real fear and the real stress and pressure that families are living with.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion, by the way, does not state that the Government did nothing; on the contrary, we recognise the international factors.

We heard it from the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, which told us how calls to their helplines are up and, in particular, we heard it from Barnardos, which described to us in such shocking terms how so many families cannot afford decent clothes or shoes for their children, who are forced to buy open-toed shoes, sandals or flip-flops in the hope that those will last longer, and are simply unable to afford basic food.  Everywhere we go we hear it.  I heard from a constituent of mine in Dublin Bay South, an assistant manager in a restaurant, who told me he has started to pick up additional shifts in another restaurant, as well as shifts with a private home care provider, just to be able to keep on top of his rent and provide for his family.  Another constituent on a good salary cannot find a place to rent and has now been invited to make bids in a bidding auction.  The landlord is asking potential tenants to indicate what they are willing to pay because there are plenty of people who will pay more if they do not.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, my colleague, Senator Sherlock in the Dublin Central constituency, and I visited Brother Kevin and his team in the Capuchin Day Centre in the north inner city where we heard that they are seeing a shocking increase in the numbers of families coming in for the free dinner service.  These are people who are working on low incomes and bike couriers working for companies like Deliveroo who are delivering food to others but are unable to afford food for themselves.  That is the shocking reality.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to the earlier question and he is right about Putin&rsquo;s brutal war in Ukraine, which has had a horrific knock-on effect, not only for all of the civilians who, even yesterday, have been so tragically killed in Ukraine, but also for all of us across Europe as we see the cost-of-living crisis deepen.  The point, however, is that notwithstanding who caused the crisis, the response here is up to the Government.  We have control of the response in this country.  We are a country that is wealthy by European standards.  We saw massive State intervention to deal with Covid-19.  That public sector investment saw us pivot swiftly and well to deliver the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage support schemes and all the other measures that were introduced.  We need to see that level of intervention now to address the cost-of-living crisis, whatever the cause, and acknowledge the very significant international causative factors.  The response is within our control.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party has called for measures to be introduced urgently and swiftly to address the real concerns so many families and households face.  In just six weeks&rsquo; time, the back-to-school crunch is coming when families will have to deal with buying school books.  They are paying increased fuel costs and seeing the cost of basic food items such as bread and milk rising.  There is a real fear around that.  Even a small set of targeted measures introduced now, before the summer recess, would make a difference to the confidence of families and households that they will be able to face into the winter, in which we all know the cost-of-living crisis is only going to deepen and the real hardship I saw yesterday in the Capuchin centre is going to get even worse for families and individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800006#D00100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1656422400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>As I have said, the Government has responded.  There seems to be a complete brushing aside of the fact that &euro;2.5 billion has been allocated to cost-of-living measures.  We are going to do more but we will do it in a comprehensive way, embracing pay.  In the private sector, the latest Central Statistics Office, CSO, data on wages are showing that the average weekly earnings in the first quarter of 2022 were up 10% from the same period two years ago, the first quarter of 2020.  The public service pay talks have adjourned but it is the wish of all to see if we can work out a resolution of that on the public service pay front.  We also need to work out matters expenditure-wise Department by Department.  That is the ideal way to approach.  We cannot create inflation in our response.  This is different from the pandemic in respect of the nature of our response.  This is not an issue where we can put &euro;10 billion on the table straightaway over a period of time because that would obviously be very inflationary.  We have to introduce targeted and temporary measures.  That is what the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and others are saying.  We will evaluate those reports to see what is the best way to target resources to reduce pressures on people.  However, we will do this in a way that also facilitates better policy in terms of public transport, for example, and healthcare costs.  We have brought healthcare costs down now.  The drug payment scheme threshold is down to &euro;80, which is beyond what was recommended in Sl&aacute;intecare, and legislation is coming in today to abolish inpatient charges.<\/p>  <p>  In a systemic way, can we reduce costs for people in their everyday lives, not just now but for the period right throughout the next winter and beyond into 2023?<\/p> <p>This would dovetail with sensible policies.  There will be a package at budget time that will impact in this calendar year on the pressures people face in respect of the cost of living.  As the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said, it has to be carefully balanced in terms of how the Government responds .  It acknowledges the Government faces a very delicate balancing act in protecting the economy and poorer households from higher energy and food prices while avoiding adding to inflation through second-round effects.  We want to avoid second-round effects.  I have been saying this consistently from the get-go.  That is what happened in the 1970s.  We ended up with spiralling inflation that got worse and worse every year.  We need to avoid this.  We need to target our measures.  We must make sure those on the lowest incomes are well protected.  There are also workers who are in difficult positions after tax because of this crisis.<\/p> <p> We have to have measures that can marry.  If we want to do something significant on childcare, for example, we cannot do packages in isolation month to month.  We need to deal with what expenditure will be allocated to the Department with responsibility for children next year, for example, to enable us to do something significant on childcare costs for people.  These are the types of evidence-based approaches we require and in social dialogue with the partners to work that out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800006#D00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656423000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>We are very happy to work constructively with the Government to ensure targeted measures are introduced that tackle the real hardship being faced by those on the lowest of incomes.

We very much accept that measures have been taken by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  We also accept, of course, that the challenges with the cost-of-living crisis are different from those of Covid.

This is the type of political will we need to see now in delivering measures that will alleviate hardship for families and households throughout the country.  We support vastly increased investment in childcare.  We have been calling for a Donogh O'Malley moment in childcare to ensure families will see a place guaranteed for each child in the country.

The political will is there.

Now there seems to be a growing backlash against the rights women have won, with all of the misogyny around the issue following the US Supreme Court's appalling decision to reverse Roe <i>v.<\/i>Wade.<\/p> <p>This is triggering abortion bans in many US states.  Of course, we know that banning abortion does not stop abortion.  It only drives it underground and hurts the poorer and most marginalised the most.  I will quote the Minister of Justice as reported in the papers today:<\/p><blockquote>\tThere is just this feeling, whatever about Roe V Wade ... there is a feeling of going back a little, so it&rsquo;s important to push back. <\/blockquote> <p>The best defence for the right of women to choose is to push forward.  Rights for women, in particular, can never be taken for granted.  The conservative religious right in all countries will always try to take over and take back those hard-won rights.  We need the promised review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, the holding of which has been committed to this year.<br\/><br\/>What will the Taoiseach's Government do to push back against the backlash against women's and trans rights so they cannot be undermined in future?  Will he commit to abolishing the three-day wait which was put into the law as a sop to those types who rejoice over Roe <i>v<\/i>. Wade?  Will he commit to abolishing the 12-week limit and to full decriminalisation of abortion in this country so women and pregnant people can be guaranteed the very basic right to control their own bodies?  Is it not time, Taoiseach, to say &quot;our bodies, our choice&quot;?<br\/><br\/>I put that in the context of the recent report which showed that from 2019, the year we passed the law, over 770 women had to leave this jurisdiction again to travel to the UK for abortion.  We also had the scandalous situation in Northern Ireland where the health Minister, Robin Swann, allowed for the laws that apply in Britain to apply in the North, but there is still not a single abortion provision in the northern state to this date.  We face a very dangerous situation.  It is hugely important that we give a lead in this.  The Taoiseach's Government has to show it is willing to push back to defend the hard-won rights for which women have fought for decades in this country.<br\/><br\/>We would like to know when the review will take place, that abortion will be fully decriminalised, that there will be a review on the three-day limit and that the 12-week limit will also be lifted.  These are very important issues for women and trans people across this country and we have already seen protests emerging on the streets again.  This will not go away.  It is very important that this Government, particularly since repeal, signals to the rest of the world that we will not tolerate a backlash against women's rights, particularly on the right to choose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800007#E00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656423600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  It is fair to say that the decision on Roe <i>v<\/i>. Wade was quite shocking in many respects but fundamentally because it overturns 50 years of jurisprudence.  In other words, what was judicial precedent over a 50-year period was overturned.  However, we are different here in this society and our constitutional framework is different.  The fundamental difference is twofold.<\/p><p>First, we have the referendum mechanism that has been built into our Constitution since 1937.  We can be thankful.  Very often the framers of the Constitution can be attacked, for different reasons, some of which may be legitimate.  However, fundamentally, it was very unusual that in the middle of fascist Europe in 1937 that a Government brought in a Constitution that limited its own power via referendum and judicial interpretation.  Referendum is a powerful mechanism.  We have chosen, as a people, by referendum to lay out our framework in terms of the termination of pregnancy and the subsequent legislation was passed in 2018.  The referendum mechanism is crucial.<\/p><p>Second, it is a salutary lesson for everyone in this House, in that we need to protect against and avoid any undermining of the separation of powers.  What had clearly been afoot in the United State for many years and which is very worrying, was the degree to which one could witness the politicisation of the Supreme Court.  People were appointed on the basis of their position on this issue alone.  Now, as a D&aacute;il and as an Oireachtas, we need to double down on upholding the separation of powers as well, because it is a real revelation.<\/p><p>The review is about the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.

It must be raised as often as possible so it will, at some stage, be dealt with comprehensively.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, has to realise that this will not go away.  It was bad when we heard about the activities of the so-called Brandon, who was failed himself by the HSE.  The families were let down by the HSE at all stages and not told the truth about their loved ones.  Even to this day, some of them have not heard the full story from the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  A couple of weeks ago in the national papers we read about another report that is being carried out by the HSE that has identified an additional ten abusers in Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court and the Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Hehir unit in Ballybofey, County Donegal.  This is the same place where Brandon lived and worked.  One of the most shocking things about this report is that it was prepared by a trawl of files within the centre, so all the information was on file in the centre which means management knew about it all along.  It is worth saying that again.  The HSE management knew all about these cases at all times.<\/p>  <p>  Families read about the new cases in the newspapers.  Some of them have been contacted by the HSE to tell them their loved one was abused by someone else other than Brandon and some, thankfully, have been told their loved one was not abused, but very few.  We must question why this happened and how, at this stage, the families are finding out like this.  All the families with loved ones in Ard Gr&eacute;ine, whether abused or not, should be offered independent advocacy even at this late stage.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot rely on the HSE at this stage to do the right thing.  As if we needed confirmation, this shows it has let down residents, families and their own staff in the most horrible way.<\/p> <p>I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is drawing up a report on the Brandon case that will be published so that we can be aware of and speak freely about what has happened.  When will the Minister of State's report be forthcoming?<\/p> <p> I really think the only solution to this situation is a Muckamore Abbey-type inquiry like we have seen in the North.  Will the Government report and make sure a full public inquiry will take place so we can be sure the families, residents and staff receive full information as to what went on in Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court and indeed all disability services within Donegal and under the HSE nationally?  The HSE nationally has tried to block the discussion on this case as much as it can, but at least it cannot yet control the D&aacute;il.  We need to have this happen as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800009#G00300","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656424500,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important and very serious issue.  As he says, the HSE commissioned the National Independent Review Panel, NIRP, to carry out a review into very serious incidents of concern which took place between 2003 and 2016.  That resulted in the publication in December of the National Independent Review Panel - Brandon Report for Publication.  Prior to the NIRP commission, a look-back review into these incidents had been conducted by an external expert.  To ensure completeness, HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 separately commenced a file review period from 1991 to 2002, reflecting the time period that Brandon was in the care of disability services.  The purpose of this was to screen all records for any notations referring to alleged or actual sexual conduct during this timeframe.  Once this work was completed, it was then externally validated.  This file review and validation report was recently made available to the Minister of State with responsibility for disability matters, Deputy Rabbitte.  The Minister of State also met with the HSE in recent weeks to discuss the reports and issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to progress the recommendations from this exercise as well as those of the Brandon report.  The HSE advises it is prioritising engagement with service users and families affected by the outcome of the review.  Further support offers will be made in the coming weeks when residents' families will have time to consider what may be helpful to them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, together with senior officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are close to finalising terms of reference for an independent safeguarding review of disability services in Donegal.  An independent expert on safeguarding will be appointed to chair the review.<\/p>  <p>  The report - that is the validation report in my understanding - has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In response, on 17 June the Garda advised that it has conducted a preliminary perusal of the report and appendices.  Given the historic nature of many of the issues, a considerable trawl of records will be needed, which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na says will require a period of time to conduct, and then the report will need to be reviewed and compared with existing information.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated a period of six weeks will be required to undertake this process.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to take these issues very seriously and to take allegations of abuse particularly seriously.  We appreciate people coming forward to report safeguarding concerns to the appropriate authorities and professional bodies.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the core question the Deputy has asked, in terms of an inquiry, I will discuss this further with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and with other members of Government in respect of what is transpiring here and the outcome of the latest validation report.  Equally, we have to take on board what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is saying.  I am going to wait the six weeks for the trawl it is doing.  We do not want to undermine any action the Garda will have to take on this either.  That is something we cannot just dismiss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800010#H00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1656424500,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for the response.

There have been failings right across the board, not only in the HSE, although the HSE is the main cause of it.  The Garda has failed and I believe HIQA has failed.  There have been serious failures.  The people they have failed are the residents, families and staff members of Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court and wider services right across Donegal.<\/p> <p>It has to be an independent report.

An independent investigation is the only way that this can be done because it has to be done in the open and fully out there.  This would never have come out at all if it was left to the HSE.

The general purpose of the Bill is to provide for measures to address failures in the market for principal private dwelling house mortgages.  The Bill, as the House might be aware, is virtually identical to a 2015 Bill crafted by Deputy Michael McGrath, now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  That Bill was reintroduced in 2016.<\/p><p>In essence, this Bill, if passed by these Houses, would under section 2 of the legislation empower the Central Bank as the financial regulator to impose reasonable caps on the variable rates of interest charged by lenders in this country on mortgages on homes once the market and the conduct of the institutions have been assessed against a range of factors set out in section 3.  Those factors, which would be examined every three months, include the reasonable profit expectations of the lenders, an analysis of the rates being charged by all lenders and the relationship between the variable interest rates charged by a lender and the cost of funds to the lender.<\/p><p>Section 4 defines market failure, with section 6 making provision for the kinds of reasonable caps the Central Bank will be enabled to impose on lenders in the mortgage market where a market failure exists in the view of the Central Bank.  The Bill goes on to make provision for fines and enforcement orders against institutions where there is non-compliance with directives from the Central Bank and so forth.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides that, in setting a variable interest rate for a group, class or category of principal dwelling house mortgages, a lender must not discriminate between existing borrowers and new borrowers.<\/p><p>With ECB interest rates set to rise significantly over the coming months, analysts believe that, in a few months' time, a homeowner with a mortgage of &euro;300,000, for example, could end up potentially paying &euro;300 to &euro;400 per month in repayments on top of what they are already paying.  At a time when hard-pressed households are getting more and more squeezed as a result of the falling value of wages and incomes amid a cost-of-living crisis, the likes of which we have not experienced in almost 40 years, it is absolutely incumbent on the Oireachtas to do all we can to protect the standard of living of those who are struggling to make ends meet.<\/p><p>This House will know only too well, since the fact has been repeated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, that Ireland is notorious for having the second highest mortgage interest rates in the EU, beaten into second place by Greece.  There was an argument for intervention in the market in 2015 and 2016 when the first iteration of this legislation was very enthusiastically tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il.  We were told at that time by the then Minister, Michael Noonan, that such an intervention could well be unconstitutional.  Since then, the Oireachtas has capped the high interest rates charged by moneylenders, an intervention in the market.  We were told that competition would bring rates down.  It has not.  With KBC and Ulster Bank exiting the market, competition has diminished even further since 2015 and 2016.  We still have the second highest variable mortgage rates in Europe and people are being absolutely hammered.  We were told at the time that the Central Bank did not want the power to cap the mortgage interest rates charged.  The Central Bank needs to be reminded that it is the Oireachtas, not the Central Bank, that legislates.  It is the job of the Central Bank to regulate using the powers that are provided to it by the Oireachtas.  The Central Bank must be reminded too that a central part of its mandate, which it conveniently forgets sometimes, is to protect the interests of the consumer, who has been absolutely clobbered for far too long with extortionately high mortgage interest rates, even when the cost of funds has been historically low.<\/p><p>I look forward to a debate in the House on the substance of what is an urgent Bill and an urgent intervention for 500,000 homeowners and mortgage-holders who are potentially very vulnerable if we are to see the kinds of mortgage interest rates the likes of Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank and former Governor of the Irish Central Bank, predict we will have over the next year.  I am pleased to introduce this Bill and I look forward to a detailed debate on it in due course.  I hope we can have that debate urgently as we move to Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800017#R00500","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1656428400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Is

We condemned Russia's weaponising of food supplies, which risks famine and instability.

All of those involved in industry, manufacturing, the dairy industry and agrifood are saying this loud and clear.  It is a form of economic illiteracy from the perspective of Northern Ireland that one would create such a dual regulatory framework because it does not allow for full traceability and it creates challenges for those exporting commodities.  This has been pointed out to me by the interests concerned and I have pointed this out.  Manufacturing in Northern Ireland is saying it has had the best time under the protocol.  That needs to be said.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised the western Balkans and I should have addressed that in my original comments.  There was something of a breakthrough at the end of the meeting, when the Bulgarian Parliament removed its objections to North Macedonia, although it put some qualifiers into the motions that were passed.  It now remains for North Macedonia to respond to that.  I would welcome rapid acceleration for North Macedonia and Albania, in particular, which are more than ready to join having adhered to all the issues that were raised with them over a long number of years and, likewise, countries such as Montenegro.  There were also good conclusions with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina regarding criteria it must meet.  The Commission will review, up to October, the degree to which Bosnia-Herzegovina responds to the various standards it has to achieve in respect of a number of issues.  That is positive.  I agree with the Deputy generally in that enlargement is important.  I reminded members of the EU Council that it was back in 1990 during an Irish presidency, of which the Deputy's father was president, that the unification of Germany was accelerated.  Many people at the time were against the unification of Germany following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The United Kingdom, in particular, was concerned about it but that meeting in Dublin paved the way for German unification.<\/p>  <p>  Other former members of the Soviet Union joined during the EU during the 2000s.  It gave them, not just a home but an opportunity to grow and develop.  That is why I believe in enlargement.  Ireland, 50 years ago, joined the Union and it has been transformative for the Irish experience.  We cannot deny others the opportunity to be part of the Single Market and a broader, standards-based approach.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brady raised the issue of President Macron's idea.  He has put forward an idea about on which we had a general discussion at the dinner on the night of the meeting.  We are open to it as a country if it means broader dialogue with countries that are not members of the EU.  However, we are very clear, as are many member states, that it cannot be a substitute in any shape or form for an enlargement process.  It cannot delay the candidacy of countries that want to join the Union.  The idea is that there would be a broader framework for dialogue on the Continent of Europe, which is important.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik raised the moratorium on exercises.  There was no need in the end because the Minister, Deputy Coveney, had been in touch with his counterpart.  There is a fair point in terms of military exercises within the Irish exclusive economic zone , but we should look more ambitiously at marine reserves.  I appeal to the fishing organisations to work with us on that in terms of areas where we can protect marine biodiversity.  I certainly support work on a moratorium on military exercises that damage spawning grounds, biodiversity and marine life.  We attended a summit organised by President Macron some months ago in respect of the marine economy and marine life.  Fishermen and others are also raising legitimate issues. <\/p> <p>I might not have gotten to everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800020#U04100","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Church-State Relations","time":1656430800,"counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00200"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":263,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[24222\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1698","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":264,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[26200\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":265,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[27831\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1486","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":266,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[29328\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":267,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[30063\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1556","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":268,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[30713\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":269,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[30839\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1656430800,"counter":270,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[30842\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagements with church leaders.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1656430800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 to 26, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Like public representatives generally, I meet church leaders informally from time to time in the course of attending official functions.

My understanding was that at the time, church leaders, who have an all-Ireland remit, were an important conduit on issues of concern to some communities, particularly communities with small numbers.  In some cases those communities with relatively small numbers might not have had as much political engagement with Governments here, the Executive in Northern Ireland or the political parties as would have been desirable throughout the entire island.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the current protocol difficulties in Northern Ireland, there are also many areas where we need to see much more progress.

The situation has evolved significantly.  I was one of the original supporters of Educate Together through measures I took with capital expenditure way back in the late 1990s to facilitate the purchase and acquisition of sites much more cost-effectively for Educate Together schools.  That was followed through and we have a far more pluralistic and democratic system now.  Plebiscites often happen and people vote for the type of school they want.  Evolution is changing the very landscape of education as we speak.  That will continue and I think we need to see more divestment and greater use of existing resources in terms of existing school buildings, for example.  There is a whole issue there.<\/p> <p> Some religious orders have also donated to the State without any compulsion.  In Carlow, for example, the third level college has been offered to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for use by Carlow Institute of Technology.  Provided it is retained for teaching and education purposes, there are no strings attached.  It is a fantastic site in the middle of Carlow.  The site of the Presentation Sisters in Cork has been transformed and is home to the Cork Migrant Centre, community groups and a range of activities.  Social housing was facilitated on that site a long time ago.  Some religious orders donate their land for the use of social housing, for example.  That needs to be acknowledged.  There are others that do not, it has to be said.  I was a bit struck when Dublin City Council recently recommended to councillors not to facilitate the zoning of church lands given the housing crisis we are in.  I was not quite sure of the overall reasoning behind that.  There needs to be balance.  We need more amenity land in Dublin, certainly, but where land is next to services and we can get compact growth housing growth, I would have thought that we should use some lands for housing given the crisis we are in.  Again, I will read up on that a bit further and in more detail.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Barry, I support unequivocally the trans community and I am not sure we can lay all the blame on religion entirely.  There are cultural issues afoot.  I certainly think within education we need to develop far more sophisticated anti-bullying policies.  We need to create a climate of tolerance.  We do not need the toxic debates that have happened in the UK and elsewhere on this issue.  We need to have a society-wide response, beginning in our schools.  There are issues we need to analyse a bit more deeply.  It is not all about who owns the school.  It is deeper than that, unfortunately, in terms of the groupthink that goes on and the degree to which people are bullied and really have journeys and experiences that are very sad in many respects and that should not happen.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is developing curricula in relationships and sexuality education, RSE, at primary and post-primary level.  That is extremely important.  I have spoken to the Minister for Education.  We need to really get those programmes modernised and updated to deal with LGBT+ issues.  RSE needs to be modernised and updated but it is also important that the teachers who deliver the curricula are resourced adequately in terms of continuing professional development and that there is a lead person within the school to lead the programme within schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800021#V01800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656431400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Yes, but there is the money message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800022#W00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1656431400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>One of the issues historically has been delivery within the schools.

That is what has happened.  The separation of powers has broken down to a certain extent in the United States.  The degree to which people are appointed on their politics and how far right they are under the Trump Presidency was a factor.  We need to be very careful that we need separation of powers.  We do not politicise the Judiciary.  That is the real lesson from Roe <i>v.<\/i>Wade.

There was a baby that was fully healthy and the pregnancy was terminated; that happened.  I have met the parents myself.  These issues are never clear.

I will open the debate by setting the context for the actions to be taken on foot of the Bill.  Although many Members will be familiar with these issues, it is important to take this opportunity to set out the complex situation we will find ourselves in with regard to security of electricity supply and the wider pressures on the energy sector.  I will also describe the sections in detail and, with regard to its main provisions, I will set out the background and why they are needed.  However, my overarching message is that while the provisions the Bill will establish are part of a broader programme of actions, it is critical that it be passed prior to the D&aacute;il rising and, therefore, I seek Members' support to achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  First, I will discuss the generation capacity gap that the provisions in the Bill seek to address, along with outlining the broader programme of actions and measures being taken to address security of electricity supply over the coming years, including how the measures in the Bill support the transition of our electricity grid to up to 80% renewables by 2030.  Second, I will reaffirm the urgency of the Bill to maintain a secure electricity supply for customers.  Finally, I will outline the necessity of the Bill in protecting customers against rising electricity costs through the establishment of a process to allow for the public service obligation, PSO, to be credited as a benefit to electricity customers when the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, calculates a negative PSO.<\/p> <p> On the factors affecting security of electricity supply, Deputies will appreciate that we in Ireland face additional pressures due to our geographical location, low levels of interconnection with other countries, fossil fuel dependency and the smaller scale of the Irish market compared with many other European countries.  However, the most immediate factor that will affect security of electricity supply in Ireland over the coming years is a potential generation capacity shortfall that was identified in EirGrid's all-island generation capacity statement, GCS, published in September 2021.  This potential capacity shortfall arises in periods of peak demand and largely due to non-delivery of previously contracted capacity, increasing electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of existing plant.<\/p> <p> The CRU has statutory responsibility to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply.  It is assisted in this role by EirGrid, which is Ireland's electricity transmission system operator, TSO.  On 7 June 2022, the CRU directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure, using the most expeditious means available, approximately 450 MW of additional generation capacity from the winter of 2023-24 up to the winter of 2025-26.  This is to ensure a secure electricity supply.  This temporary generation capacity will be in place until more enduring capacity can be delivered through regular market auctions.<\/p> <p> The specific nature of this CRU direction requires the legislation that is before Members today to ensure EirGrid can fulfil the direction as required.  This legislation includes supporting provisions for EirGrid in its role of securing the temporary generation units with equipment manufacturers and contracting for its deployment and operation by electricity generators.  The legislation also ensures the necessary financial support can be given to EirGrid to achieve the objective.<\/p> <p> While this legislation facilitates security of supply through the provision of temporary generation, which ensures there is sufficient reserve capacity on the system to enable security of supply in the peak periods when there is low wind and low interconnection available, it is important to note that this will not impede any of our plans for renewables, interconnection, batteries, demand-side response or energy efficiency.<\/p> <p> Having this reserve capacity allows EirGrid to have more confidence in scheduling network outages for new connections to the grid, such as new wind and solar farms from the recently announced renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, 2, list of projects.  Having this backup capacity gives more confidence to the grid operator to make these necessary connections and upgrades without jeopardising security of supply.  This is very much in keeping with Government policy of delivering up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030.<\/p> <p> Further to this, the Bill also provides for an increased borrowing limit for both EirGrid and Bord na M&oacute;na.  This enables EirGrid to invest in the Celtic interconnector with France and other necessary investments to ensure our grid can accommodate up to 80% renewables by 2030.  It also enables Bord na M&oacute;na to further develop its brown to green strategy and deliver new investments to former peat harvesting regions.<\/p> <p> In order to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming years, it is vital that this legislation be passed prior to the D&aacute;il rising to ensure certain measures can be initiated in time, in particular, that EirGrid, from July 2022, can acquire electricity generation, sell and transfer the electricity generation plant to an electricity generator and enter into an agreement with an electricity generator for the operation of the electricity generation plant.  I press the urgent nature of this situation and reiterate that it is of paramount importance that this legislation is passed immediately.<\/p> <p> Crucially, as well as providing for the provision of temporary generation for the coming winters, the Bill establishes a process to allow for the PSO to be credited as a benefit to electricity customers when the CRU calculates a negative PSO.  This provision will enable the delivery of savings to electricity customers.<\/p> <p> Under current legislation, the PSO levy is charged to all electricity final customers to fund renewable electricity generation schemes designed by the Irish Government in support of national policy objectives.  The RESS has introduced a two-way floating premium, which means if the wholesale market price is higher than the bid price, the supplier pays moneys back to the customer through the PSO mechanism.  The existing legislation does not provide for crediting a negative PSO levy.<\/p> <p> In recognition of the rising cost of living and the impact on households and businesses of increasing energy bills, the Government approved, on 14 June 2022, legislative amendments to enable PSO payments to be credited as a benefit to electricity customers when the CRU calculates a negative PSO.  This legislation is required in order for the CRU to be able to direct that the PSO can be credited to customers over the period from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2023.  This credit has been provisionally calculated by the CRU to be in the order of &euro;75 for the average domestic customer, which is a net saving from the current charge of more than &euro;127.  The CRU will make its final decision on these amounts in July.  It is vitally important in these times of rapidly rising energy costs that we allow passage of this Bill to deliver this saving to households and businesses and, in particular, financially vulnerable residential consumers.<\/p> <p> I will devote my remaining remarks to the subject matter of the Bill.  This Bill is designed to enable EirGrid to take certain emergency measures, including acquiring electricity generation plant and entering into agreements with electricity generators in relation to electricity generation plant, for the purpose of ensuring and protecting security of supply, pursuant to a direction of the CRU.  For that purpose, the Bill provides for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to give financial support to enable EirGrid to take certain measures.  The Bill also increases the borrowing limit of EirGrid through an amendment of the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Act 2008.  The Bill includes an amendment of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to provide for payments to final customers of certain benefits relating to compliance with a public service obligation.  The Bill also increases the borrowing limit of Bord na M&oacute;na through an amendment to the Turf Development Act 1998.<\/p> <p> I will provide a section-by-section summary of the Bill.  There are 14 sections.<\/p> <p> Section 1 is a standard provision which provides for definitions.<\/p> <p> Section 2 sets out that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act are to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to the extent sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides that EirGrid shall take urgent measures as required under a direction from the CRU to ensure security of electricity supply, including acquiring electricity generation plants, selling and transferring such plant to an electricity generator and entering into an agreement with an electricity generator to operate the electricity generator plant.  It provides for the operation of generation plant in line with the CRU direction and for operations to cease upon the earlier of the fulfilment of the direction or 31 March 2027.<\/p> <p> Section 4 prevents EirGrid from operating generation plant acquired by it pursuant to a direction from the CRU and provides for it to enter an agreement with an electricity generator to sell the emergency generation plant and undertake its operation.  This section also ensures that the electricity generator may only receive reimbursement of reasonable costs and a reasonable return as may be approved by the CRU for undertaking this activity, and that upon termination of the agreement, the electricity generator shall dispose of the electricity generation plant in an arm's length transaction in accordance with any direction of the commission.  This section includes a provision that in all circumstances EirGrid shall be paid the full price of the electricity generating plant and any profit received on a sale of the plant by the electricity generator.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides for obligations on EirGrid to take measures as required under a direction from the CRU to ensure security of electricity supply and ensures that EirGrid obtains no benefit other than reimbursement of reasonable costs and a reasonable return as may be approved by the CRU.<\/p> <p> Section 6 ensures that all functions performed under this Act shall be in compliance with laws and treaties of Ireland and the European Union.<\/p> <p> Section 7 provides for the Minister to provide financial support to EirGrid in an agreed form and manner, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It obliges EirGrid to use financial support for the purposes of complying with a direction of the CRU only and that the use of any income or revenue received in connection with the agreement with electricity generators shall only be used for the purpose provided or the purpose of making distributions to its shareholders as determined by the directors of EirGrid.<\/p> <p> Section 8 provides for a quarterly report by EirGrid to the CRU.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides for the CRU to make further directions to EirGrid, the public electricity supplier or an electricity generator to address the temporary electricity emergency and, where such a direction is not complied with, to apply to the High Court to make such order as it thinks fit.<\/p> <p> Section 10 provides for the CRU to report upon progress to the Minister not later than 31 October 2026 and for the Minister to make an order to extend the period for which the emergency generation can be operated by one year, upon approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for an increased borrowing limit for EirGrid up to a value of &euro;3 billion.<\/p> <p> Section 12 provides for the amendment of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to allow for PSO payments to be credited as a benefit to electricity customers.  Calculation of the annual PSO levy is a matter for the CRU.<\/p> <p>On 14 June, the CRU issued a draft determination that gives the potential for a refund of approximately &euro;75 for the average domestic customer with the passage of this enabling amendment. <\/p> <p>Section 13 provides for the amendment of the Turf Development Act 1998 to increase Bord na M&oacute;na's borrowing limit to &euro;650 million.  Section 14 provides for the Short Title and commencement of the Act.<\/p> <p> I have outlined the main provisions of this emergency measures Bill and provided additional detail on the sections.  I hope this will be of assistance to Deputies.  I look forward to an informed and meaningful debate and to working constructively with the Deputies on all sides of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800022#W00500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656432600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I would like to register my concern at the rushed nature of this Bill.  Deputies only got sight of the Bill last Tuesday and it has not undergone any pre-legislative scrutiny, although we had a briefing on it, which was welcome.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in and others in opposition had other important questions we wanted answered and we wanted to hear from stakeholders.  There are still very many unanswered questions but we did not have the opportunity to deal with them.  As is often the case, the Government had the numbers so pre-legislative scrutiny was waived and we are where we are.  The Bill is now being rushed through all the legislative Stages as the Government scrambles to ensure the lights will stay on in winter 2023.  That is an incredible situation to have left us in.<\/p>  <p>  We will be constructive and we will engage, but we need to shine a light on the issues that got us to where we are.  Successive Governments have walked us to the cliff edge and this Government is now in a rush and panic.  Opposition parties got just one day to read the Bill and submit amendments, and I will touch on a number of Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  I make the point that rushed legislation often results in bad legislation and bad law.  For a Bill dealing with a number of separate and complex issues, including the borrowing limits for semi-State companies, a change in the operation of the electricity PSO and the procurement of &euro;350 million of emergency gas generation capacity, I want to state on the record that this is no way to do business.<\/p>  <p>  The main aim of the Bill is to allow EirGrid to procure 450 MW of backup electricity generation capacity to ensure we have enough electricity to meet demand over the coming years.  This mismatch in electricity supply and demand is a direct result of failed, incoherent Government policy.  The Minister of State very quickly in his 12-minute speech referenced non-delivery of previous contracted capacity, increasing electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of existing plant.  We could delve into each one of those issues and unpack the policy decisions, assessments, judgments and public signals that were made in regard to them that took us to a very different place than either had been intended or prepared for.  We would have to ask how on earth we got to a point where there is a threat of electricity blackouts and we need emergency legislation to literally keep the lights on.<\/p>  <p>  Data centres are at the heart of this problem.  They now use as much electricity as all the homes in rural Ireland combined and this is set to at least double by 2030.  This is putting huge pressure on our generation capacity and it cannot be consistent with our emissions reduction targets.  The last Fine Gael Government rolled out the red carpet for data centres and sought to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world, with no thought about the impact this would have on our electricity supply or carbon emissions.  The current Government has not changed approach, despite our more ambitious climate targets and the increased threat of electricity blackouts and amber alerts.  The prospect of amber alerts is now in the common parlance and the vernacular of people in a way that it never was, certainly in my lifetime.  Sinn F&eacute;in will move an amendment on Committee Stage tomorrow, again calling for a moratorium on the connection of new data centres to the grid.  We literally are not in a space where we can be confident that they will not force the lights to go out.<\/p>  <p>  Another reason the Green Party in particular might be keen to rush this legislation through is to gloss over the fact that it is a spending splurge on new fossil fuel infrastructure.  This Bill will give EirGrid permission to spend &euro;350 million on new generation capacity, which is likely to come in the form of backup gas-fired generators.  Can the Minister of State confirm that &euro;350 million is the ceiling, not the floor, of this expenditure?  This spending flies in the face of commitments to move away from fossil fuel infrastructure and will further damage emissions reduction efforts in the energy sector.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, we saw an increase in our carbon emissions of about 6% and in 2022 we are unlikely to see any reduction either.  We are now building new gas generators to ensure we can keep the servers running in data centres.  The &euro;350 million for these gas generators could have been used to install solar panels worth &euro;5,000 on 70,000 homes across the State, reducing energy poverty in those homes.  That would have reduced electricity bills and provided an income from microgeneration.  Instead, it is these very people living in energy poverty who will likely foot the bill for the cost of this extra capacity via higher electricity bills.<\/p>  <p>  How much will be added to household bills based on this proposition?  The Minister of State referenced the &euro;75 to be returned to people with the new configuration of the PSO because of the high price of gas, which is welcome, but, on the other side, is there an additional cost to households based on these proposals and, if so, to what extent?  Will it offset the &euro;75 that will be returned?  Did the Minister of State examine the prospect of requiring large energy users to cover the cost of this backup capacity, given it is not homes in rural Ireland or anywhere else that are causing this demand, and it is largely attributable to data centres?  There are a host of unanswered questions which I would like the Minister of State to address in his closing remarks or on Committee Stage tomorrow.  As I said, there was no opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State clarify if this additional capacity will be oil powered or from gas generators, or what form will it take?  We have put down an amendment for tomorrow &ndash; I would like to see the Minister of State support it - that seeks to ensure priority is given to renewables and to zero or low-carbon options or those that are most easily retrofitted into zero or low-carbon alternatives so there is a prioritisation within the capacity we seek to bring on board.  What criteria will have to be met for the new capacity to come into operation?  Will this be an option of last resort or will it be scheduled for operation during the winter?  Can the Minister of State outline what happens when these generators are no longer needed?  Will they be decommissioned and, if so, in what way, will they remain in place as a backup to renewables, or will they be sold on to private energy companies?<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will amend the Turf Development Act 1998 to increase Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s borrowing capacity to &euro;650 million to help it fund its expansion into renewable energy.  This is welcome, given the urgent climate crisis.  We want to see the State, through semi-State companies, lead the way on investment in renewable energy to ensure the State retains as much ownership as possible of our energy production capacity.  We know there is room for the private sector, which has an important role in our energy transition, but we want to see the State lead the way.<\/p> <p> In regard to the amendments we will bring forward tomorrow, we will seek to prioritise renewable energy or low carbon backup electricity generation where possible; require EirGrid to have regard to the human rights record of electricity generators with which it enters into agreements; seek to introduce a moratorium on grid connections for new data centres; seek to provide for the sharing of information about the procurement of these additional generators from EirGrid and the CRU with the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action; seek the publication of the energy security review; seek a report into the policy failures of electricity supply and demand that led us to the point where we need to procure emergency additional capacity; and seek a report to be commissioned into the impact that Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Energy Charter Treaty, ECT, will have on our path to net zero and whether Ireland will be open to litigation by fossil fuel companies under the provisions of the ECT for taking action to phase out fossil fuels.  That is particularly relevant in regard to the potential for lock-in on this new capacity.  I would like to hear from the Minister on those matters in the Committee and Report Stage debates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800024#Y00200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656433200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The war in Ukraine has brought a new urgency to the discussion on all aspects of our energy, its use and where it is sourced.  The political upheaval, added to the climate and biodiversity upheaval wreaking havoc among communities across the planet, brings a new urgency to our energy considerations, not only practically and economically but also, as my colleague said, ethically and morally.  In the context of the latter considerations, the amendments Sinn F&eacute;in will propose on the human rights records of any company or plant with which EirGrid enters a relationship are timely and fitting.  Clean energy must be clean in all aspects of its sourcing.  I will digress a little to address climate-related matters and point out that the same must apply to electric vehicles, including the conditions affecting those mining for materials used in their production.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal that no new applications from data centres for grid connections will be approved by EirGrid until such time as the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications directs otherwise is equally important.  Renewable energy sources are critical.  However, it is equally critical that we use less energy on our planet and convince people of this urgent need.  This will be a serious challenge for all of us in this State and everywhere else in our world.  We cannot continue on a business as usual basis.  In our case, hearing from expert witnesses at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action about the moratorium on grid connections for data centres being lifted or extended is absolutely vital<\/p>  <p>  In regard to energy security we are entering new and uncharted waters.  Governments throughout the EU are walking a delicate path where they are both warning and reassuring their populations about the reliability and availability of energy into the autumn and winter.  In light of the publication of the energy security review, it is necessary to do as we propose, namely, that within one week of the completion of the energy security review, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must publish the report in full along with all supporting documentation.<\/p>  <p>  Politicians and Governments have revelled in being able to provide certainty to our electorate.  This is somewhat old-fashioned in the face of climate change and can also be rather patriarchal.  We must level with people because it is perfectly clear to anyone who has been paying attention that we have now entered a new political and climate reality whereby everything is possible but nothing is really certain.  All that is certain is the further, quicker and deeper climate disaster that we face if we keep up our gung-ho pursuit of profit and economic growth no matter what the cost to the planet, be it to people or biodiversity, of which the human species is part and upon which we depend for our survival.  I hope the Minister will look favourably on the amendments we will put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800025#Z00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1656433200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>To start with the positives of this legislation, the best thing I can say is that thankfully, despite the name of the Bill, it has nothing to do with turf.  The increase in Bord na M&oacute;na's borrowing capacity to &euro;650 million to help it fund its expansion into renewable energy is a positive step.  Regarding the projects in which Bord na M&oacute;na is involved, it must respect the community in Oweninney, keep the promises it made and do everything to alleviate the stress of homeowners who must live with those projects.  I ask that the Minister look at that issue because it is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We all want to see the State lead the way in the investment in renewable energy to ensure the State retains as much ownership as possible of our energy production in the future.  The transition to renewable energy opens a window of opportunity in this regard.  The Bill allows EirGrid to procure 450 MW of backup electricity generation capacity.  The need for this has been caused by the abysmal management of electricity infrastructure and planning by successive Governments.  The legislation also makes it possible for the PSO levy to move into negative to give a discount on people&rsquo;s bills.  This is certainly very welcome.  It is estimated that this will save households about &euro;75 in 2023.  However, the Department&rsquo;s recently produced national energy security framework estimates a 45% to 60% increase in electricity costs above 2021 levels later in the year.  That amounts to an increase of between &euro;500 and &euro;700 per household.  The impact this is having on small and medium businesses is ferocious.  It is straining the viability of many such businesses and further driving inflation.  This is the direct result of rising gas prices.  The price of gas dictates the price of all electricity prices despite the fact that almost half of the electricity comes from wind.  Unless you own a wind turbine, this is bad news.  Too many households cannot take much more bad news when it comes to bills.<\/p>  <p>  Mayo, in particular the north of the county, has some of the highest levels of energy poverty in the State.  I have raised the need to look at the EU prescribed system for pricing electricity with the Minister and the Taoiseach over the past year.  Each time, the issue has been dismissed out of hand.  If this was out of a desire to be the best boys in Europe, please note that two weeks ago the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said this market system does not work any more.  We must reform it and adapt to the new realities.  Thankfully, other governments across the EU have not been as passive and have pushed for reform within the European Commission.  We should be leading the way on this, as I have said many times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800025#Z00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1656433200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I will repeat the point made by others that it is far from ideal when such significant and complex legislation is rushed.  This Bill has significant implications, the most significant of which relates to allowing EirGrid to acquire new emergency electricity generation capacity.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke flagged, it is unfortunate that our electricity supply is under such pressure partially as a result of the enormous footprint of data centres.  The Bill also increases the borrowing limit of EirGrid and Bord na M&oacute;na, a proposal that needs to be considered further.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a crucial role to play.  It also reforms the electricity PSO levy to allow refunds to customers.<\/p>  <p>  I will primarily focus on EirGrid.  EirGrid is likely to be one of the most significant semi-State companies over the next 15 to 20 years.  It has a crucial role in our climate transition strategy.  There is a need to upscale the existing capacity rapidly, not only in electricity generation but also in planning and preparation for oncoming wind energy and other renewables.<\/p>  <p>  My primary point on this legislation, which is one I have repeatedly made to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is that wind, particularly offshore, has enormous potential.  Cork Harbour has the potential to become a world leader in offshore wind.  To do that, we need to address skills shortages in some areas and we must ensure that rather than having to bring in the bulk of the expertise, we are able to provide it at home and create employment domestically.  We need to ensure that those responsible for planning, regulation and related Civil Service modalities are in a position to do so.  I have in mind EirGrid, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, the Planning Regulator and everyone who will have a hand in examining applications and ensuring sufficient capacity exists.<\/p> <p> I return to the point made by Deputy O'Rourke.  The sheer scale of the footprint of data centres is extraordinary.  That it is now effectively equivalent to the footprint of rural Ireland represents an extraordinary amount of energy.  We need to consider a moratorium on these centres very carefully because they are clearly having a disproportionate impact on electricity supply and, potentially, our future energy security.  That must be considered very seriously at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800025#Z00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656433800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the main purpose of this Bill is to ensure we have sufficient electricity generation in place for this winter through to 2026 following the direction from the CRU to EirGrid to procure an extra 450 MW of power generation capacity.  We appreciate the Government was left in the unenviable position of having to get this legislation through as quickly as possible to ensure EirGrid can legally procure the generators and have them in place.  We understand EirGrid will then sell and transfer those to an electricity generator and enter into an operating agreement.<\/p><p>What we must ask is why this Bill is being rapidly pushed through the Oireachtas at such a late stage in this term.  I urge the Minister of State to address the question of how we find ourselves so exposed to supply shortages and why this legislation is only being brought through now.  I raised during the Order of Business, as did colleagues, that it is not good legislative practice to see legislation, especially when it is complex, being rushed through in the last few weeks of the summer term without pre-legislative scrutiny and without being given the time that would usually be spent on considering it.  My understanding is the CRU direction was issued on 7 June, the Bill was approved, I think the Minister of State said, by the Government on 14 June and a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny was granted on 21 June.  This is an important and complex piece of law, designed to comply with EU energy rules, state aid law and procurement regulations and in a context, of which we are all conscious, that we may be facing an emergency in supply.  We appreciate extra generation capacity cannot just be added in overnight but we believe this legislation could have been brought forward at an earlier date.<\/p><p>If we go back to last autumn, significant questions were even then being asked about the prospect of the lights going out.  That was before the war in Ukraine began and before the brutal invasion by Russia.  Even then, concerns were raised about the tendering process for generating capacity.  The current crisis cannot be blamed on the war in Ukraine alone or on the rapid increase in gas prices, although the brutal war has clearly exacerbated energy security and supply issues internationally.  We also appreciate that the current crisis represents a failure of long-term planning in this country on the transition to renewable energy sources.  Throughout last summer and into the autumn, the pressure on electricity supply grew due to the growing demands from data centres, which the House has debated, as well as the transition from dirtier fuels like coal and the balancing needed to support the generation of wind power.  This was constantly highlighted even before the war on Ukraine began.<\/p><p>We know 1 MW is considered enough to power 1,000 homes, so the capacity we are procuring is sufficient to power nearly 500,000 new houses and apartments.  Considering only 33,000 or so units are likely to be built per year, if we generously assume 150,000 new homes are built over three years, that still leaves surplus capacity.  Where will that energy go?  There is no real transparency on this.  This is another of the issues that arise.  Some proportion of the new capacity will power new developments in the economy.  The CRU stated in its announcement that these emergency measures were needed due to the increased risk of older generators becoming unavailable and ageing out.  The older generators are also not as efficient as newer ones and have higher carbon emissions.  However, we are concerned the measures will still lock in new fossil fuel generation capacity.  The Minister of State might advise in his wrap-up speech if the announcement just last week of census figures showing record population growth, and the follow-on demands on housing, social services, workplaces and so on, have been factored into the proposed energy needs and planning for future winters.<\/p><p>Another important question that arises, even after this emergency procurement measure, is whether a similar exercise will be required next year or the year after.  Again, the issue of planning for future needs arises.  This legislation is possible because it deems there to be a &quot;temporary electricity emergency&quot;, but how do we do we know whether an emergency is likely to take place in 18 months' time?  Indeed, if that is to be the case, when does it start and end?  Once we go down the route of getting the transmission system operator to source emergency extra capacity, it will become the default option if the electricity generation market is not operating properly.<\/p><p>A central question about these generators is what fuel they will run on.  Again, there is a concern about enhancing our fossil fuel dependency.  Will EirGrid be told what to procure?<\/p><p>Another question is what will be the cost to the State of developing and running such generators.  Reports say it will be recouped from customers over a three-year period.  Is the State putting up the capital spend in the first place?  The Minister of State might clarify where the &euro;350 million of capital funding for these generators is coming from.  According to the announcement, &quot;the Government [had] approved the necessary capital funding &ndash; in the order of &euro;350 million for EirGrid&quot;.  That is where we see that figure.  We are told that this will support and enable implementation of the initiative for winter of next year, 2023-24.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether this is direct capital aid from his Department's budget or if it represents borrowing by EirGrid?  If it is from the Exchequer, will the capital allocation for the Department be increased and, if not, are there projects that may remain unfunded due to the need for this funding?  We need to hear from the Minister of State what the additional cost will be and if there will be an additional cost to households.<\/p><p>This is happening at a time when energy companies are making extraordinary and unexpected profits due to the soaring prices of fossil fuels.  The Labour Party has called for a windfall tax on excessive profits as a measure that could and should be included in budget 2023.  The revenue raised could be used to fund additional climate mitigation and energy efficiency measures that would reduce further our reliance on energy imports at a time when we are seeing unprecedented insecurity of supply, largely due to the brutal Russian war.<\/p><p>While we are rushing through this law so these new gas generators can be put in place this summer, it has not been adequately explained why the ESB, a publicly-owned company, previously pulled out of a contracts to build a number of gas power plants.  There has been extensive reporting in the <i>Business Post<\/i>by Daniel Murray on this and the matter has been raised in this House as well.  We understand the size of the plants that were to be built would have been almost equivalent to what EirGrid will now have to procure.  The question remains as to whether this has contributed to the supply crisis that underpins the legislation.  Is one of the reasons for this legislation an expectation we would have additional capacity for power generation but can no longer rely on it?  Is it likely that the ESB will be one of the electricity generators contracted to deploy and operate this emergency supply?  A number of questions arise regarding the introduction of this emergency legislation.<\/p><p>A significant concern I and my Labour Party colleagues have about this proposal, one that I have already mentioned, is that it will lock in more fossil fuel generation.  Will the emergency plants be decommissioned after the winter of 2025-26?  How will that impact on our climate emissions targets and our capacity to reach those targets by 2030?  We know some less efficient generation may be replaced but is this in effect a way to quickly put in place extra capacity that renewables cannot deliver in the short to medium term?  Does this amount to a tacit acceptance we cannot meet our targets?  If so, that is obviously of immense concern.<\/p><p>Again, is this new extra capacity really to allow for the development and operation of data centres?  So many questions have been asked about data centres and their feasibility at a time when we are under such pressure to meet crucial emissions reduction targets.  Friends of the Earth has asked a number of important questions about what alternative measures have been considered, such as demand-side management.  Again, we have debated that issue in this House, including the question of imposing a moratorium on new data centres.  I am aware that several Committee Stage amendments have been tabled on data centres and energy security and supply.  I urge the Minister of State to give them serious consideration.  We also ask that the social, economic and environmental impacts of the generators be carefully monitored.  Will the Minister of State clarify how the placement, approval and licensing of these emergency power plants will be assessed?<\/p><p>Another provision in the Bill is to increase the borrowing capacity of Bord na M&oacute;na to &euro;650 million to support its brown to green transition.  That is obviously a hugely important programme, although as a previous speaker noted, the reference to turf in the Bill is unfortunate.  We might all agree on that, whatever our other views, especially considering the aim of the company is to move away from peat extraction.  That move is very much to be welcomed but it would be useful for the Minister of State to outline what projects or investments this borrowing will support and give a commitment that a strategy from Bord na M&oacute;na will be presented to the Oireachtas joint committee.  We have an opportunity in Bord na M&oacute;na to build out a national wind company and a national retrofitting company.  This would be State-led development that would secure our energy transition and underpin a just transition.<\/p> <p>Regarding the public service obligation, PSO, levy, not all members of the public may be familiar with this levy on their electricity bills.  It is set annually by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  It appears as an &euro;8.60 charge, before VAT, at the bottom of bimonthly bills.  At present, the annual charge for households adds up to just over &euro;56 a year after VAT.  This came into effect in October 2021.  The core purpose of the PSO levy was to support renewable energy, peat and security of energy supply plans.  Generation from turf ended some time ago, however.  My understanding of the CRU decision is that the increased wholesale price of electricity due to rising fossil fuel prices and the increased demand means that further collection of levies to support renewables are no longer immediately needed.  I ask the Minister of State to address that point.  Questions must be asked in respect of how successful the PSO has been in delivering on its objective of security of supply, given that the Bill has been introduced and we have been told its main purpose is to allow emergency procurement by the grid operator of sufficient supplies for the winter after next, with a secondary purpose being to refund PSO levies.<\/p> <p> The question remains as to what went wrong in the long-term planning if we are now seeing a reversal of the PSO programme.  It was previously announced by the Government that the PSO would be set to zero from October, providing for a saving on bills.  The Minister indicated this mechanism would be used to offset the carbon tax increase.  However, for the first time, the CRU earlier this month issued a draft determination that there should be a refund.  As the Minister of State outlined, section 12 of the Bill will provide for a refund of approximately &euro;75.  The Government is calling it a saving but it should not be forgotten that this is a refund of money people have already paid and, although the PSO levy will not have to be paid from this winter, families and households are paying for the cost of inaction.  Essentially, households are paying for our collective failure to build sufficient renewable capacity, combined with our ever-growing reliance on imported gas for energy generation.  This means households are paying for a lack of energy security through increased fossil fuel prices.  Will the Minister of State, when wrapping up the debate, indicate his views on the future use of the PSO and whether it will be reapplied in future?<\/p> <p> I am conscious that I have asked a significant number of questions.  I see the Minister of State is nodding.  I do not need the full 20 minutes allocated to the Labour Party to point out that the Bill raises several critical questions for households who are already in fear.  They are facing a winter when there will be real fears in respect of insecurity of supply and lights literally going off.  To be fair, that is not just the case in Ireland, as this is an international crisis.  However, many of us in opposition have been calling for the Government to adopt targeted measures in the form of a mini-budget or emergency budget.  What is needed is a series of targeted measures to alleviate the hardship being faced by many households.  This comes in a context where we in the Labour Party are saying Ireland needs a pay rise.  Households need to have increased income in their pockets to meet the significant rises in the cost of living, of which the huge increases in energy bills are just one aspect.  The Labour Party is conscious the prices of food, childcare and many necessary essentials for households are also rising.  It is in that context that I am raising all these questions.  They are fair questions to put as we debate the Bill.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on a point that is also in the context of the cost-of-living crisis faced by many households.  The Labour Party is conscious the PSO is a fixed charge on households, irrespective of energy use or household income.  That means those who use the least energy and those with the lowest income pay the same amount as others.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul pointed that out previously and called for a review of the application of the PSO to low-income and struggling energy customers.  The Minister of State might consider that.  We know from recent ESRI publications that one third of households are already in energy poverty.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has called for the introduction of social tariffs for energy supplies, a policy we in the Labour Party support.  We again call on the Minister of State, and all Ministers across Government, to examine this serious issue of energy poverty as part of a comprehensive cost-of-living package, preferably this summer but certainly in the October budget.  All present anticipate that substantial measures will need to be introduced in October if the Government does not move any sooner.  The fear that already exists among many households in respect of the further hardship that will be caused by rising fuel and energy prices in winter is a serious issue.  I know that is appreciated by all present.  It is in that context I raise these questions on the Bill, its provisions, impact and purpose and the background to its introduction.  It is unfortunate it is being brought through the Houses so speedily and without the pre-legislative scrutiny that, ideally, it should have undergone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800026#AA00200","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656434400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The energy sector underpins much of the nation's affairs.  The effects of price fluctuations in the energy market have knock-on effects for almost every aspect of the economy and can make a real impact on the lives of consumers and their daily decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The invasion of Ukraine has appalled the moral and civilised world.  The loss of life and direct attack on people's sovereignty is a dark moment in European history.  The war has also marked a significant turning point in energy policy across the European bloc and, indeed, the world.  In this context, we must begin a comprehensive discussion on the future of energy and energy production and supply in Ireland.  As I mentioned previously to the Minister of State, that discussion should take place sooner rather than later.  The war in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on Russian oil and gas have disrupted the flow of supply to Europe.  In light of these developments, there has been a perhaps overdue spike in awareness across Europe that we must redouble our efforts to increase energy independence within the EU and Ireland.  We cannot have scenes and speculations such as those we witnessed last autumn and winter, when questions over blackouts and brownouts were rife.  That is why planning ahead is so important.<\/p>  <p>  The single biggest way we can do this is by rapidly expanding our capacity to produce renewable energy, such as through wind and solar.  We have known for some time this was where we would have to go in the context of climate change.  We now have the immediacy of energy supply disruptions to compound the issue.  Ireland has the potential to become a major energy hub.  Our geography, weather and demographics place us in a position to play a unique role in the production of energy.  Not only can we dramatically increase our production for domestic use in the years ahead, we can also begin to transform the economy to become an energy exporter.  We are already on the road towards delivering an increase in the share of renewables flowing through the national grid.  This process has been increasing year on year for some time and the figures will be bolstered by the completion of the Celtic interconnector, which will deliver clean electricity, mostly derived from nuclear power generated in France.  I recognise, however, that these are matters that will take time to resolve.  Changes in planning regimes, the development of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, and certain anomalies that need to be addressed will not be solved overnight.  Today I noted that the Cabinet signed off on a new legislative amendment to streamline onshore wind energy generation.  That is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  As we look to the here and now, and to the immediate future, we must ensure we have the ability to meet the demands of society.  I welcome the fact that plants that were previously deactivated for essential maintenance are now back in service.  That will ease some of the strain on the grid we witnessed last year.  We must invest in the national grid to respond to the growing energy demands and the growing population.  This includes using the grid technology as it was designed rather than the stop-start approach that was adopted and led to the two plants being out of commission in the first instance.  The grid needs dramatic funding increases and I think the Bill goes some way towards that.  I question, therefore, the comments of certain Deputies in respect of the perceived urgency of the Bill.  It is urgent that the grid is upgraded and that we have the capacity to borrow to purchase the necessary equipment to meet the demands of the nation.  I question the comments of the Opposition, particularly the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, in respect of pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Bill addresses a very urgent matter, namely, the &euro;75 PSO rebate.  In the context of a mini-budget, for which the Opposition is calling, the Government is stepping forward and stating it will bring this about immediately and there will be a &euro;75 rebate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800027#BB00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1656434400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>The Government could have done that last September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800027#BB00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1656434400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>That legislation is being put through the House right now.

We are having this debate today because we are now facing an emergency.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome some of the aims of the Bill, including to increase the backup electricity generation capacity to ensure we have enough to meet demand over the coming years.  That is needed to avoid blackouts.  However, we cannot escape the reasons we have arrived at this juncture.  We are debating this legislation today as a direct result of failed Government policy.  I know that is true because when it is pointed out to Government Deputies, they get very sore and fractious and they start to interrupt people.<\/p>  <p>  The shortfall in electricity supply is primarily due to the rapid expansion of data centres in this country, which is fuelled by Government decisions.  Are we surprised by this?  No, we are not.  We need only look at the damage vulture funds have done to the housing market in this State while paying hardly a red cent in tax.  It was Fine Gael that let the real estate investment trust, REITs, into the State to wreak havoc and it is Fine Gael that has allowed data centres to pop up everywhere.  Time and again, we hear Fine Gael politicians talking about Ireland Inc.  That is how they view our State - as a business, not a society with a community of people.  There should be no confusion that would lead people to believe the problems the State faces are accidental or somehow happened by mistake.  Very often, they have arisen as a result of conscious policy decisions.  The red carpet was rolled out for data centres.  Fine Gael sought to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world, with no thought for the impact this would have on our electricity supply.  This is what happens when a political party acts like a portfolio manager or agent for big business, rather than acting as a Government, the job of which is to safeguard the energy security of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  It is patently clear we have a problem with the prevalence of data centres.  This legislation reveals the Government has finally realised that.  There are now 70 operational data centres in Ireland.  Dublin has become the largest data centre hub in Europe.  Moreover, in north County Dublin, a number of new centres are under construction.  We know where the problems lie, what has caused them and where to lay the blame as we find ourselves in this emergency situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800028#CC01700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1656435000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>We have a very long two and a half years ahead if we must continue to face this Punch and Judy show between Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in.  There is an issue in regard to pre-legislative scrutiny and the processes behind it in respect of this Bill.  It is not acceptable that most of us are standing up with questions for the Minister of State rather than being able to debate from a position of information.  The committee received the documentation on these proposals five minutes before we were asked to have a briefing on them.  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny allowed.  That obviously has led to a large gap in our knowledge base regarding the Bill, its purpose, how it will be managed and what is proposed around it.<\/p><p>None of us wants to see any blackouts in the coming winter or any winters thereafter.  I accept there is a need to deal with the situation urgently.  However, the issue was raised last year.  The CRU published a security of supply information note in September in which it identified a shortfall.  This legislation could have been worked on and drafted at that point.  Indeed, my party brought forward a motion at the time calling for a data centre moratorium because we recognised there would be a shortfall and a risk of blackouts.  We offered the Government a solution for dealing with part of the problem but, unfortunately, it was ignored.  It is not the case that this issue has come like a bolt out of the blue.  It was foreseen.  We are in this emergency situation because, unfortunately, the Government has not dealt with it in a proactive manner.<\/p><p>There were comments earlier about the PSO levy and how these provisions will reduce the bills for domestic levies.  However, there has been no acknowledgement from the Government that it is giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  While the Bill will reduce the PSO levy, it will also place additional costs on domestic bills because of the cost of the additional generation.<\/p><p>I am concerned that the Bill is pretty much open-ended.  There is no alignment between what the CRU has said it needs and the dates by which the Bill will be in operation.  The Minister of State indicated in his statement that the provisions in the Bill will cover a period out to winter 2025-26, which is not what the CRU requested.  The latter has said the measures are required until the winter of 2024-25.  Will he clarify this discrepancy?  It seems we are giving the CRU and EirGrid <i>carte blanche<\/i>in respect of the legislation.  There is also no limit on the amount of generation that can be purchased.  Going through all the data, I am confused as to exactly how much will be purchased through these provisions.<\/p><p>The security of supply programme the CRU published identified that 300 MW of temporary emergency generation will be required for winter 2022-23.<\/p> <p>Is that provision separate to this Bill?  While the CRU welcomed the Government's decision in respect of this Bill and the procurement of 450 MW, that is actually for the winter of 2023-24.  Questions arise then over exactly how much electricity generation can be procured through this Bill.  Is it instead, as is my fear, completely open-ended?<\/p> <p> The CRU stated it would need an additional 450 MW of temporary emergency generation.  This amount could, however, increase to 700 MW if the security supply actions the CRU has highlighted are not implemented.  Therefore, there is a risk that this Bill could, essentially, be treated like the magic porridge pot and that its provisions will just continually grow and grow.  My amendments are intended to try to put some structure in place in this regard and to ensure that there is a cap on the amount of electricity that can be generated.  I refer as well to the reporting mechanisms, because we want information in this regard to come before the D&aacute;il.  It cannot be the case that this legislation is giving permission just to continue to grow energy demand.  I hope the Government will take these amendments on board, because it is important to have some threshold and that oversight can be brought to bear on it.  The CRU also stated that an additional 200 MW have already been identified and are in the process of being procured.  If this is the case, and the requirement is obviously above and beyond the 450 MW, how is that happening in the absence of this legislation or will that procurement also be covered by this legislation?<\/p> <p> Turning to the issue of costs, it has been estimated that the 450 MW will cost approximately &euro;350 million.  Regarding the other 200 MW that I mentioned, I imagine that would then add an extra &euro;180 million or something like that.  Will the Minister of State address whether this is an additional cost that we must also deal with?  Equally, if an additional charge of &euro;40 is going to be put on domestic bills as a result of the procurement of 450 MW, and if an additional 200 MW is going to be procured outside this process as well, will that mean that another &euro;20 will be going on each bill?  I ask the Minister of State to clarify in his closing remarks exactly how much additional money will be put on domestic bills as a result of this temporary emergency generation capacity increase.<\/p> <p> I listened closely to the Minister of State's contribution and a few things were left out.  Key among those is the issue of data centres.  The reason we are in this situation in reality is not because of external shocks, external demands or international issues.  We are in this situation, and this has also been acknowledged by the CRU, because of the high growth of large electricity users, primarily data centres.  It is unacceptable that this Bill is going through without any discussion on how we can manage the increasing demand being placed on our system by data centres.  It is unacceptable that there has been no acknowledgement of this fact either in the Minister of State's speech or in this Bill.  Again, an amendment in this regard has been submitted by the Social Democrats.  The intention of the amendment is to identify that this is an emergency Bill and if it is an emergency Bill to deal with electricity demand and to prevent the high risk of blackouts and brownouts, to specify that emergency measures should also be brought in regarding data centres.  I refer to a moratorium.  Therefore, once again, we are asking that the Government bring in a moratorium on the development of data centres until there is a strategic overview of how many data centres we should have, what their benefits are, what conditions we will place on them and what we will ask them to do to be part of the solution as opposed to being the problem, which is essentially what they are now.<\/p> <p> One area I raised with T&aacute;naiste last week was that, despite what we are talking about here and despite the potential investment of &euro;500 million to deal with the fallout from all these data centres, the Government has still not published its statement on data centres.  It was promised for quarter 1 of this year, then for quarter 2 and then the T&aacute;naiste told me last week that it would not be available shortly and that he has not yet received a copy or has not seen it.  The question then is what exactly is the Government doing when it comes to data centres.  What is its strategic focus?  What is its planning?  What is it taking into account?  Is it just because of some bureaucratic administrative process that data centres are under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and therefore everything else is sort of operating in the absence of it?  That would be a real worry.  Therefore, we are asking the Government to be strategic about this issue and to take this aspect into account and to plan.  A failure to plan in this regard has been clearly obvious from the actions of the Government regarding energy supply, particularly in the last year.<\/p> <p> The other thing that we have not heard from the Minister of State, and it is quite surprising when he has come to the floor of the House to request that this additional fossil fuel generation be implemented, is an acknowledgement or mention of our climate targets and the impact this additional generation will have on us meeting our targets.  In the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action today we discussed the sectoral emissions ceilings.  It is incredibly ironic that we spent the morning talking about that issue, while we are now coming in here and we are going to undermine many of the actions and efforts the country is trying to undertake in that regard by signing off on this emergency Bill.  The fact that the Minister of State has not addressed this aspect and is not taking it into consideration is a real red flag for me.  There are concerns in this regard.<\/p> <p> I have mentioned before that when the Government is dealing with the areas of energy and how we are going to manage our security of supply, the focus of the Government is currently on individuals.  It is always on individuals.  The impost is on individuals to deal with it.  When we are looking at our transport sectoral ceilings, we are talking about electric vehicles, EVs.  When we are talking about household emissions, it is about retrofitting.  The responsibility is always placed on the individual to solve this problem for the State.  Yet the Government absolutely refuses to make the largest users of energy accountable for their energy use and also refuses to place any limitations on their energy use.  This is unacceptable.  When we are talking about data centres, we are talking about energy users that account for every single rural house in Ireland.  Every single rural household in Ireland could go out and retrofit, and we will expect them to do so and it will be costly for many people and many will not be able easily to find the money to do it, and yet this is what the Government is expecting those households to do.<\/p> <p> It would have been much fairer to have managed data centre requirements to ensure that those individuals would not have to spend the money to slow or reduce their emissions, and for the Government to have pointed at and focused on the real problem here, the big energy users.  It is similar when it comes to EVs.  We will expect people to pay a great deal of money to buy an EV.  Many people will not have the money to do that.  Instead of asking the data centres to control their energy usage or of controlling the energy usage of data centres, we are putting the responsibility on individuals to deal with this problem.  Even in this Bill, because of the amount of energy that data centres are using, individual households will have to pay at least an extra &euro;40 due to procurement of capacity.  I do not understand how the Government&rsquo;s focus can be on the individuals and not on where the real problem lies.  When legislation and policy is being developed, I ask the Minister of State to bear this point in mind.<\/p> <p>What we are seeing is the burden is being put on the wrong people.<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats have tabled a number of amendments to the Bill.  As it has been an expedited process and there has not been an opportunity to have the discussions we should have when developing legislation, I ask the Government take into account the amendments we will put forward.  They are relatively simple and include a cap on the amount of energy, reporting mechanisms, and reducing the timeframe available so that the Government can control this process a lot better than has been done previously.  There is also the moratorium on data centres, but to be honest, I reckon that horse has probably bolted.  If we are at a point where we are now forking out hundreds of millions for generation capacity to deal with them, I imagine many of the data centres that were planned are already up and running.  However, I ask that the Government consider and take on board the moratorium because we do not want to make the situation worse while we are in this emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800028#CC01800","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656436200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill, the Minister of State's opening statement and today's debate.  I certainly agree with him that we should seek to be constructive in our debate on this legislation.  Many of the points made have been constructive.  I have not seen the amendments put forward, but I am interested to see them.  If they are constructive and add to the Bill, we should consider accepting them.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the debate while in my office and I heard many speakers characterise the Bill as being necessary to facilitate data centres on the grid, but this simply is not true.  While I hate to say this, it betrays either a technical ignorance or it is playing politics, or it is both.  This legislation is required for the State to get off coal and oil.  We have a big coal-fired power plant in Moneypoint with an output of about 900 MW, and we have a power plant in Tarbert, across the Shannon Estuary, which burns oil.  As demand increases and we seek to electrify our heating and transport sectors, we need this Bill and this capacity.<\/p>  <p>  It was said earlier that the situation we find ourselves in reflects \"the abysmal management of electricity infrastructure ... by successive Governments.\"  This is a ridiculous thing to say because the one huge success story of our efforts to transition away from fossil fuels has been that 40% of our electricity now comes from renewables.  Electricity generation is an area in which Ireland is a global leader.  The comments by some Members to the debate are a real disservice to the thousands of people working in the sector who are the unsung heroes of climate action in this country.  The comments are, of course, a dig at this Government as well as at previous Governments that put in place the plans that got us to the 40% renewables rate.<\/p>  <p>  Speakers said it was unfortunate we are in this position.  Some Opposition Members are bewildered as to why we need this legislation and have said it is a result of a failure of planning.  Do they not realise we are in this position because we are pushing the boundaries of what is possible for variable generation on an asynchronous electricity grid?  This is not a failure; it is a consequence of success.  Members do not seem to understand the importance of having capacity in the system.  This electricity generation plant will be available but it will be used very rarely and only when renewables are not available, so it does not compromise our ability to get to 80% of our electricity being generated from renewables.  The Minister of State was very clear on that in his opening statement.  This legislation will help us get to the 80%.  We cannot have ambitious renewables penetration in the system unless we have this kind of capacity as well.  We are in the lamentable situation in which the Opposition will berate the Government for not developing renewables, even though we are global leaders, and then try to impede our ability to go further by seeking to block critical, enabling legislation such as this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Yes, we need demand side management, but let us move beyond the data centre trope.  Sensationalist and selective facts are thrown about as if they are some kind of slam dunk.  The reality is electricity generation accounts for between 10% and 15% of our emissions and data centres, by EirGrid's projections, will account for about 27% of that 10% to 15%.  Only a few percentage points of Ireland's emissions in 2030 will be attributable to data centres.  A moratorium on data centres was mentioned.  It should be put on the record of the House that there has been no connection of data centres for about two years in this country.  Therefore, there is an effective moratorium in place.  We have to go beyond talking about data centres if we are to be true to the phrase \"demand side management\" and to reduce emissions in that way across the system.  However, no one in the Opposition seems to want to talk about demand side management in any meaningful way.  We need to talk about how we reduce demand in heating and transport, which is through retrofitting and a modal shift in transport.  These are and will be much bigger emitters in 2030, even by our own projections.<\/p>  <p>  There is an opportunity for Ireland to become a net exporter of clean energy to Europe.  The 80% target for 2030 is one of the most ambitious targets of any country in the world, but there is actually potential for Ireland to provide power to Europe.  Europe is in a very difficult situation where it has relied on Russian fossil fuels, in particular during the past ten to 15 years.  Ireland could provide clean energy to Europe.  We could go beyond the 80% target - well beyond it, in fact - and that would be very good for our efforts to decarbonise our system as well as for our economy.  This legislation is critically important for us to reach and go beyond the 80% target.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the debate.  There have been some constructive comments made but there have been some very ill-informed comments made as well.  When this is reported on, I hope the old trope about data centres and this Bill being needed to enable data centres will not be seen as the central point of this debate because this is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800030#EE00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1656436200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>The Bill will allow EirGrid to procure 450 MW of backup electricity generation capacity to ensure we will have enough electricity to meet growing demand in the coming years.

It is a sad reflection on Government policy, or the lack of it, that we are in this situation.  This is a direct result of failed Government policy.  Failing to plan means planning to fail.<\/p>  <p>  This shortfall in electricity supply is primarily due to the rapid expansion of data centres.  The Government has failed to manage the development of data centres.  Of course, we need data centres but they must be in proportion to our data usage.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have made this country a data centre dumping ground, which has allowed other countries to abdicate their responsibilities.  Every country must share the burden.  Data centres account for 14% of all our electricity usage, as much as all the homes in rural Ireland combined, and this usage is heading for 30% by 2030.  It is simply not sustainable.  The extra electricity generation that will be necessary is likely to come from additional gas generators at a cost of &euro;350 million.  The cost will be paid by electricity customers - they will love that - over a three-year period, and we have the scenario of a Green Party Minister investing in fossil fuels.  It simply does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  The war in Ukraine should have been a wake-up call to take action in ensuring our energy supply is secure.<\/p> <p>The energy security review must be published immediately.  There has been far too much dithering, and we need a credible plan to prevent brownouts and blackouts.  The gap between supply and demand of electricity has been caused by the major drain data centres are placing on the grid.  The previous Fine Gael Government welcomed data centres with open arms and sought to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world, with no consideration of the impact that would have on our electricity supply.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will propose a number of amendments to the Bill, as the Minister of State will be aware.  We must prioritise renewable energy or low-carbon backup electricity generation where possible.  We need a moratorium on grid connections for new data centres.  We need a report on the policy failures of electricity supply and demand that have led us to the point at which we need to procure emergency additional capacity.  Finally, we need to update wind energy guidelines and we need those updated guidelines to be published.  The current guidelines are 16 years old and out of date.  We need to protect our rural and scenic areas.  The midlands has reached saturation point with industrial wind turbines.  The obvious answer, as we know, is offshore.<\/p> <p> I listened to other Deputies earlier.  Deputy Whitmore said it will be a long two and a half years.

It is not that that in itself is a bad precedent because it is a regular occurrence and there may be times when emergency legislation needs to be fast-tracked.  We have known about this issue for some time, however, and it is clear from the briefing we received in private session from officials that many issues should have been examined but will not be because of the rushed panic now.<\/p>  <p>  Like others, I ask where this rush is coming from.  Essentially, we are being told of very dangerous blackouts in the coming winters if we do not immediately purchase additional emergency plant, most likely gas-fired, to tie us over for a limited period.  How limited that period will be, however, is unclear.  It may be three years or it may be more.  Why?  Old plants are being retired, we are told, but it is explicitly clear from the EirGrid and CRU statements that the real reason for the panic is to facilitate data centres, pure and simple.  We need this measure because the State and the Government have refused to deal adequately with the unhinged proliferation of data centres, something a previous Deputy called a sensationalist old trope.  He is completely wrong because, as has been said, 14% of our electricity is consumed by data centres now.  That is set to rise to 28% and to 30% in the coming years.  As a State, we are a complete outlier.  We are essentially the data capital of Europe and, indeed, probably the globe.  This is not because we are all streaming videos or constantly using Twitter.  It has nothing whatever to do with the data consumption of the people in this country.  It is driven by the needs and desires of big tech, regardless of whether it is sustainable globally or nationally.<\/p>  <p>  There have been attempts by people who should know better to say that data centres are not a problem but a solution to the climate crisis because they produce smart devices and smart tech that can help us reach our emissions reductions.  We have even been told that streaming Netflix is not as damaging in terms of CO2 emissions as was previously thought.  That is nonsense.  The only figure we need to keep in mind is the amount of electricity the data centres consume now and what they will consume in the years ahead, which is 30%, massively ahead of the global national average of between 2% and 4%, as in most other states.  It needs to be said that technology, whether in the form of data centres, carbon capture and storage or feed additives for cows, will not stop the climate catastrophe now unfolding.  Only actual reductions in CO2 emissions will.  That requires deeper and more radical changes, not business as usual with a high-tech gloss on it.  Instead of simply acceding to every whim of the technology industry and to every command from Amazon, Google, Facebook or whatever else for every data centre they ask for, we need to ask what purpose this serves society.  It is an astonishing figure.<\/p>  <p>  Some studies suggest that 51% of all data processed and stored is what is called dark data, that is, data that are essentially, by any measure, useless, unusable and unused.  These are old files and old reservoirs of information that remain unused.  Aside from that 51%, how much of the remaining data does society need to have stored and processed?  How much are data processed and stored that could aid us in various ways in the future to deal with the climate crisis?  In reality, we do not know because behind the walls of these data centres is a wall of secrecy, with an intent to keep it secret.  We know, however, that a huge chunk of it is what is called surveillance capitalism, that is, the desire of corporations to monitor and to monetise all our personal data to sell us stuff.  We know that a sizable chunk of the data is purely about the business models of modern capitalism, all of which have very little to do with saving the planet and a lot to do with extracting every inch of labour from workers and selling every product possible in any way possible.<\/p>  <p>  I, therefore, do not accept that we must at all costs facilitate the proliferation of data centres as if our lives depended on it.  It is an insane policy.  It was clear from the briefing we received form officials that the so-called new restrictions on data centre applications apply only to new applications.  We have, I believe, many existing applications that are open and approved, with promised connection to the grid.  They will not be affected.  This panic to bring in &euro;350 million worth of gas-fired plant is designed solely, it seems to me, to facilitate these data centres.  We have no study or impact assessment as to what these new plants will mean for our emissions targets or if they risk locking us into gas use.  They may also strengthen attempts to build LNG terminals here.  None of this has been looked at because of the rush and panic involved in pushing this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to comment on some of the spin around the PSO levy.  We are told that savings on people's bills could amount to &euro;127 a year from the scrapping of the current levy on electricity bills and the potential for further refunds.  I am sceptical about that.  Again, it seems it would have been useful to drill down into these figures that are thrown around.  We welcome any savings for consumers, but this is relatively small beans and we have no assurance as to when the refund will happen.  We know, however, that the cost of this emergency plant may land on people's bills in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  As for another aspect of the Bill, we have no issue with that the ability of EirGrid and Bord na M&oacute;na to borrow greater amounts as such.  It seems sensible to allow State companies to invest and to borrow greater amounts given the scale of the crisis, what we need to do and the pace at which we face it.  Again, however, we need to be assured that the borrowings and investments of State companies drive the transition away from fossil fuels and do not end up in any way facilitating continued reliance on fossil fuels or, indeed, bogus plans and strategies such as some forms of biomass, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I will make a more general point.  Much of this legislation is built around the restraints on EirGrid and other State companies in providing the plant and the planning for its use.  Time and again we are told that the market must be protected and its working must be respected.  A lot of this Bill is about safeguards as to who gets the plant and how it must not be interfered with because of the workings of the market.  It seems clear that the current crisis in energy prices and the massive surge in the numbers of people in or in danger of energy poverty are not just about the war in Ukraine but also driven by the profiteering of various companies in energy, fuel production and electricity generation.  The profits of many of those companies have never been better.  This State went from having one of the most efficient and cheapest generators of electricity to having one of most expensive today.  That has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine.  It is a direct result of the deregulation of the energy industry in the early 2000s.  This becomes more than an academic debate when we consider the climate crisis and the need to make investments in the grid and in renewable energies in the years ahead.  It is clear that making allowances for the crazed market system we have here and in Europe is not an aid to better or more efficient use of energy.<\/p> <p>It guarantees the opposite through profiteering, investment decisions based on what is best for individual companies and continued investment in fossil fuels.  Indeed, the rush to build and import LNG from the USA in recent months has put a great question mark over our ability to hope to limit temperature increases to 1.5&deg;C or even 2&deg;C, with all of the horror that this means for our planet and its people.<\/p> <p> It is becoming clearer as each record is broken and as each new crisis throws us off our path of reducing our CO2 emissions that the market is not a solution and is a big part of the problem.  We need a rationally planned system to deliver energy and a rationally planned way to invest in renewables on the scale needed and this cannot be done in the current market system with competing companies vying for profits.  All these crises, including energy costs, the possibility of power cuts and the need to move away from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energies, point to the need for the State to take a direct part in the future of energy.  We need a State-owned and directed company to invest in the grid and in renewable energy and to deliver, as we did previously, the energy we need in an affordable way for citizens.  We need to remove the danger of more and more people being submerged in energy poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800031#FF00200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656437400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>We are dealing with rushed legislation on an issue we all, to a degree, saw coming down the tracks.  Long before we entered into the disaster of the war in Ukraine, we had been speaking about whether we had difficulties with energy security.  We knew that there was the possibility of blackouts and wondered whether they could be avoided.  There was also the issue as to whether anyone could make a promise and whether anything that a Minister or Minister of State said was or was not a promise in ensuring that we could keep the lights on.  We all know that there has been a failure to deal with the issue of data centres.  That is not even from the point of view of stopping and saying that we cannot have them but from the fact that we have once again not dealt with that element of planning.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues have dealt with the issues on which we will table amendments.  They will deal specifically with the fact that if we are talking about increased generation capacity, we very much need to put an emphasis on renewables.  I probably did not think that I would be saying that to a Green Party Minister of State but that is the work that we need to do.  We are all aware of the work that needs to be done on a wider scale on offshore wind, in particular, and I have heard it said more than once in this particular august auditorium that we can be an absolute powerhouse in that respect.  We can be a superpower in wind energy and that is the place that we have to put ourselves.  <\/p>  <p>  No member will give out about changes to the PSO levy if we can put money back into people&rsquo;s pockets.  Our party has said more than once that people are really struggling at this point in time.  We need to do what we can while accepting that we cannot do everything to mitigate the worst aspects of this, which people are dealing with.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about some specifics in the borrowing capacities of EirGrid and of Bord na M&oacute;na.  People will not have difficulties with those specifics once we can see that the pieces of work that they will do with these renewed or updated capacities are what we require to provide a holistic solution to what we need.<\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers said that we need to see the results of the review on energy security.  That is completely necessary.  We are dealing with this emergency legislation that should have been dealt with at a far earlier stage.  We should have got the fundamentals correct but we are now in the place that we are in and we need to ensure we are punching in the correct direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800032#GG00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1656437400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important issue.  Security of energy has been brought into focus generally by the fact that we have seen over the past number of months how fragile a nation we are when it comes to our energy supply.  This has been reflected in a lack of investment over a number of years.  It is important that we examine what we are doing now and how we address this problem so that we do not have to face it again.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation needs to ensure that the consumer does not pay for this and the people who should are those who are using it in the main.  We have had people talking about data centres and their footprint across this country.  Data centres are important but they need to up their game to pay for the energy.  We as a country should develop our data centre network in pace with the available electricity capacity we have.  We need to look at that.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate to the Minister of State what I have said in the House previously, which is that when we have people who want to create something different and produce their energy in a different way, they are sometimes penalised.  For instance, homeowners who installed microgeneration solar panels in their roofs to capture the sun to create electricity in their homes always operated under the assumption that they would feed back into the grid and would benefit from that.  That was supposed to have been in place from 1 July last year.  I still have people contacting me who have no information as to when they are going to get paid, how they will be paid, or the rate at which this payment will be made.  There has been a complete lack of communication.  When we talk about all the things we are going to do in this country, microgeneration is an area whereby people will produce electricity.  At the moment, they are feeding it back into the grid.  These people feel more aggrieved at the moment because the price is going up and they feel that the product that they are giving back into the grid is more valuable.  Yet, they are giving it away, are not getting any money for it and do not even know how much of it is going to the grid because the meters are not there to measure it.  <\/p>  <p>  We have not planned this very well and have created a very bad taste in people&rsquo;s mouths because they have made this effort and have done this.  When someone goes to their house and looks at the system they have put in and everything is fine, people then say not to touch it until we have the plan in place as to how they will get paid.  At the moment, this plan is supposed to be in place and people are supposed to have been paid from this month.  It has not happened yet, however, for many people in my constituency of Galway East.  That is something we need to address.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the transition we have to make, in which we all have a responsibility, we must ensure that it is planned, that is, not so much just a broad plan or a big headline about money but we have to develop it in a way whereby everyone knows what is going on.<\/p>  <p>  There is major potential in this country to develop green energy that will help people make the transition.  The offshore energy potential on the west coast is second to none.  I fear that the pace at which we are looking at that will mean that much of the benefit that will accrue from that will go some place else and not to Ireland.  We need to develop our ports to ensure they can take the capacity and potential that is there to ensure the servicing of pylons and all of that type of work is done in our country.  That maintenance work should not go to Norway or some place similar.  It is important that we get the value added to whatever we are doing in this country.  We have significant assets on our shores and it is important that we ensure we harness those to their full potential for our entire population and economy.  If we concentrate on that as much as we have concentrated on the data centres coming into the country, we will be able to have more data centres as we will have green energy.  The data centres themselves, however, will have to pay for the energy that they are using at a correct rate to ensure they are contributing to the cost of the electricity.<\/p>  <p> I have said before that we have done things in the past that have not been right.<\/p> <p>I will give what is a typical example of the wind farm erected in Derrybrien in my constituency.  It was a disaster from the word go.  When the works were happening there was a huge mudslide.  It was terrible for the environment and the area.  We got it to a stage whereby it went into production and it was producing electricity.  It also had many other benefits for the community.  All sorts of masts were helping with communications.  I have received a letter from the Taoiseach stating that it will be decommissioned and will not go ahead.  The advice is that a mess was made of the planning from the start.  We do not seem to learn.  This project has gone on a journey to hell rather than to purgatory.  There seems to be no way out for it other than to let it burn away.<\/p> <p> When the pylons come down they will be very valuable to somebody.  They will probably go to another country where they will be used to generate wind energy.  We can give out about it but we should not let this lesson go without correcting it for the future.  We have to make sure it is corrected in a way that we can simplify how we realise the potential of using offshore and onshore renewable energy to develop our electricity supply.  We have the potential.  We have everything going for us.  This is a classic case where we introduced legislation that handcuffed us from the start.  We have poor transposition of European laws and we have handcuffed ourselves in many areas.  The Derrybrien situation should be examined not in ten years time but now to see how we correct it so it never happens again and we do not end up in the courts in Europe or paying fines or heavy penalties for something we did wrong in the eyes of Europe.<\/p> <p> The Bill is important for energy security.  Much of what we do is a knee-jerk reaction to situations as they arise.  We need to make sure we are not including strategies, plans and announcements.  We need to make sure that what we put in place is workable and that we see the results fairly quickly.  There is great potential but there must also be investment to make sure it happens.  We have tabled amendments to the Bill and I hope they will be taken on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800032#GG00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656438000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the chickens coming home to roost Bill.  None of what is before us should come as a surprise to anyone, particularly anyone in government because over a long number of years they have been made well aware of the issues we are facing now.  We are told the objective behind the Bill is to provide temporary electricity generation to replace older power plants and meet the growing demand for electricity caused by data centres.  Interestingly, on 7 June 2018, after a very long, protracted and detailed set of discussions at Cabinet, the Government published its statement on the role of data centres in Ireland and the enterprise strategy related to it.  In the report there is a section on electricity infrastructure that highlights the growing demand that would be placed on the electricity network by continuing to allow data centres to be given connections to the grid and granted planning permission.  The report states a large proportion of existing and planned data centres were due to connect to the electricity system in the Dublin area and, based on the committed expansion of existing data centres and expected growth, the total demand could treble within ten years.  Sadly, the legislation we are dealing with today is in large part a result of the unhindered approval of data centres connecting to the electricity grid.<\/p>  <p>  The report raises the question of who will pick up the tab for the increased investment that needs to be made in electricity generation, electricity transmission and the distribution networks.  Ultimately it is the electricity users who have to pay for it.  The customers of the electricity suppliers have to pay for it through their electricity bills.  This is done in part through the public service obligation levy to meet the generation aspect.  Then we have the transmission costs paid to EirGrid.  This particular report, produced in June 2018, highlighted the impact this would have on higher network charges and increased PSO levies.  It stated mitigating measures should be taken to minimise these charges to ordinary electricity customers.  To date absolutely nothing has been done to mitigate the cost of this.  Families throughout the country are struggling to pay their electricity bills.  They have to decide between paying electricity bills and putting food on the table.  They are subsidising the green electricity going into the data centres and its transmission costs and distribution costs.  The Government continues to sit on its hands on this issue.  As I told the Cabinet back in 2017 and 2018, it is immoral to be asking families who are struggling to pay their electricity bills to pay for the cost of this additional electricity going into the data centres.  That is exactly what the Government is proposing to do with the legislation before us.<\/p>  <p>  Part of the need for the 450 MW of electricity is because we have decommissioned power stations.  The impression being given by the Government is that this is to replace older power plants but it is not.  We are also replacing some new kit.  I brought this to the floor of the House on 3 December 2020 when I questioned the T&aacute;naiste on the two power plants in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  Mr. Ciaran Mulvey, the Government's just transition commissioner, had said in a report that on its visit to Shannonbridge and Lanesborough the just transition team was impressed by the pristine state of the power stations.  Why would they not be in a pristine state?  At that point in time they had a ten-year lifespan remaining.  I pointed out to the T&aacute;naiste on the day that we were effectively wasting &euro;176 million of electricity customers' money that had been paid towards the cost of those two power plants which were being mothballed because of the decision taken.  I said at the time that electricity customers in particular would foot the bill for the demolition of those pristine plants and that they would have to pay for the alternative technology to provide replacement stability on the electricity grid.  Here we are today bringing forward legislation to do just that.<\/p>  <p>  What is frustrating about this is that we convinced the Government, and it was written into the programme for Government, that there would be a review of all of this before any decision was taken.  A steering group was established.  Of course the steering group involved the ESB, which had its own vested interest in ensuring both of the plants were decommissioned.<\/p> <p>Sadly, electricity customers have not only paid for the cost of those two plants, which had a ten-year lifespan left, they are now paying for the replacement 250 MW of electricity that could be produced by both of those plants today in the legislation.  Just over two years ago, I said we should not make the mistakes that we made in the past, when we demolished our sugar plants in Mallow and Carlow.  I argued against those demolitions at the time.  Let us not repeat those mistakes.  Sadly, we are now repeating them and asking the electricity customers of this country and the families that are struggling to pay their electricity bills to foot the cost of this irresponsible decision that was taken.<br\/><br\/>The argument will be made that we cannot continue to burn peat.  I do not make that argument whatsoever.  I did not make that argument in 2019 or 2020, nor did I make that argument when I was Minister.  There is substantial biomass available if we issued licensing for the thinning and felling of forestry in this country.  Plenty of brash could be brought in and supplied to those two power plants today.  Bord na M&oacute;na had set up BioEnergy at the time, to source indigenous biomass.  In fact, with just &euro;33 million in investment, we could get farmers to plant &euro;10,000 ha of willow over a three-year period, to supply both of those power plants.  That can be done tomorrow morning if the political will is there to do so.<br\/><br\/>The argument will be made regarding planning permission.  It would require emergency legislation be brought forward, as it would with regard to Derrybrien.  Does it make sense in the middle of a climate emergency to bring forward emergency legislation to invest in fossil-fuel power generation when we have biomass and wind energy alternatives available to us?  The Government is not prepared to engage on that objective.<br\/><br\/>Many of us received correspondence today from the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>regarding the emissions reduction targets that agriculture will have to achieve by 2030.  This issue will be debated, quite heatedly I suspect, at Cabinet over the coming weeks, as to whether we should be looking at a 22% reduction in agricultural emissions or a 30% reduction, or somewhere in between.  The reality is that managing our land far better would take CO<sub>2<\/sub>out of our atmosphere, reduce the harmful effects of climate and improve our oceans far quicker than just shooting down agriculture.<br\/><br\/>One of the ways to do that would be to support farmers to grow biomass within the vicinity of our three peat-fired power stations - Lanesborough and Shannonbridge, which have been decommissioned, and Edenderry, which is the only plant that is currently operational.  If we supplied 100% locally-sourced biomass to those plants, this would reduce agricultural emissions on local farms by 600,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>per year.  That would be the equivalent of removing 130,000 cars off our roads.  It would generate &euro;465 per hectare, with a price of carbon at &euro;100 per tonne.  It would also create 4,000 seasonal jobs in harvesting and guarantee incomes to farmers in the midlands.  We could use the Bord na M&oacute;na rail network that is still in place to transport that biomass to those three power plants, rather than bring it on road.<br\/><br\/>It is about a small bit of joined-up thinking.  This should not come as a surprise to Government.  These are discussions I have had at Cabinet with some of the members of Government that are there today.  I have engaged in these discussions with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and people are well aware of the alternatives.  We are told we are better off investing in fossil fuels and asking struggling families to pay for it.  I believe that is immoral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800033#HH00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656438600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Regarding the wider and often overlooked point about our national electricity grid, it is opportune to outline that there is only one electricity grid in Ireland.  It is operated by EirGrid and owned by the State.  Today, 40% of Ireland's electricity is generated by gas; 40% by wind; 10% by coal; and 10% by peat, oil and solar energy.  Another point worth noting is that the grid is largely constructed for fossil fuel usage.  This means that it is not capable of handling large volumes of renewable energy.  Any energy analyst worth his or her salt will say that the two energy sources do not mix well.  That is why the Government's ongoing claims and sweeping statements of having 80% of Ireland's electricity come from renewables by 2030 are hollow and empty, without the considerable investment in the grid that is currently needed.<\/p>  <p>  Estimates by Eirgrid suggest that a minimum investment of more than &euro;2 billion is needed to upgrade the national grid.  Thus, based on what is contained within the Bill, EirGrid will be allowed to proceed with higher borrowings to meet such future investments.  The outcome of the approach is crystal clear in that the Government's policy plan will mean much higher electricity bills in the future, as this money is recouped through higher charges to energy suppliers, which will ultimately be directly passed on to the consumer.<\/p>  <p>  Various reports have been leaked or published that set out the position and warn that Ireland will not have enough energy to meet the demand for the next five winters.  One report by EirGrid explains that this is due to the Government's decision to close power plants, coupled with an increase in demand for electricity.  The current Government's frenzied green policies of pushing ahead with effective bans on peat harvesting, together with bans on the extraction of domestic energy sources, mean that this one-dimensional, sole focus on cleaner fuel sources, at some point in the future, will force a situation in which the lights go out.  <\/p>  <p>  Energy costs and security have never been more central in public discourse.  As the war in Ukraine rages, we are now acutely aware of just how fragile energy security is throughout Europe, but especially in Ireland.  That is why the Rural Independent Group moved a Private Members' motion two weeks ago in the House, which sought to force the Government to act.  However, just as it does all proposals from the Opposition benches, the Government blocked it and voted against developing Ireland's domestic energy security roadmap.  Developing the oilfield off Barryroe could have been a solution to some of our fuel crises, as it could be one of the largest oilfields off Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Since this extremist Green, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Government has taken over power in Ireland, it has been constantly posturing about its glossy plans to build renewable capacity and achieve power, with 80% of our energy needs to be met by renewable sources come 2030.  However, the race for renewables has not even begun preseason training and lacks any credible action plan.  This extremist Green, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Government accuses us of never having solutions to all the crises that are happening, one after the other.  I handed the Minister a solution more than a year ago.  It was a proposal for a floating LNG terminal, on which he failed to act.  The Government failed to act on our motion two weeks ago relating to the Barryroe oilfield off the coast of Cork.  I tell the Government not to ban turf.  It is very simple.  The Government failed to act on that.  We have plenty of our own briquettes.  The Government should stop importing them.  The carbon footprint from importing must be massive and it is completely ignored by this Green Government.  Only EirGrid in Ireland, owned by the Government, could reduce the price of electricity for every man, woman and child.  The Government should stop taking tax of nearly &euro;1 on every litre of fuel.  Those are solutions that at least improve the lives of the people in this country.<\/p>  <p>  These are the solutions but this extremist Green, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Government do not want to listen.  Every member of this Government is responsible for the downfall and what is to come of Ireland.  Talking about not listening, it is obvious what is going on from when I brought up the fuel issue with the Taoiseach today.  Boats are tied up at piers because they cannot afford to go out.  Standing orders were suspended in the council yesterday to talk about this.  One Fianna F&aacute;il councillor said he knew someone for whom it would cost &euro;42,000 to go out for his catch.  He was tied up and was not going to move.  The same goes for other boats.  The Taoiseach said today that he did not understand and that he did not hear me.  In the name of God, is that the sympathy he has for the people of west Cork?<\/p> <p>Is that the sympathy he has for the farmers and fishermen who are struggling severely?  He must remove himself from his position if he is not able to understand their position.  They are not able to farm the land because contractors cannot pay &euro;1 extra for the price of diesel, which the Government has let go out of control.  They are not able to fish because they have had to tie their boats to piers; they cannot pay the &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to go out fishing.  The Government is in trouble and its Members will know it in the next election.

It could get cornered with that because the Ministers do not want to listen to anybody.<\/p>  <p>  We have an opportunity in Kerry and a very worthwhile company has had a proposal in the offing for many years at Shannon LNG, where we could source gas and bring in the gas from western countries that might be inclined to sell it to us rather than dealing with Putin and others.  We are in trouble with Brexit and Britain's Prime Minister Johnson as well.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is now the Taoiseach and went around north Kerry canvassing with Councillor Norma Moriarty when he promised the people of north Kerry he would support Shannon LNG.  What has he done?  He allowed his Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to object and put in a submission against it.  We had our own gas and people went drilling off the coast of Kerry.  Of course, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, stopped that.  We had a proposal in the Chamber a few weeks ago involving Barryroe but that was shot down, despite the possibility of any amount of oil and gas being there.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk here today about data centres but we should strive to put people in households, homes and business before the data centres, please.  That is all I will say about them because much has been said about them.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about turf.  We have it and it is our own but there is now a war in Europe that is threatening to be the third world war.  What have we done only closed Bord na M&oacute;na when we had the possibility of generating our own electricity.  Every day since it closed, the cost of electricity has increased.  Everybody in the country knows that.  Everybody we ask, whether in homes or business, will say the cost of electricity has increased every day since Bord na M&oacute;na closed.<\/p>  <p>  We cut our own turf and there has been much talk about turf.  We have had seven generations cutting turf; I was the sixth generation and my daughter and sons are at it now.  We will make no apologies to anyone for cutting the bit of turf and keeping our homes warm.  We are proud to do that.  The people before us did it and it is part of our culture.  There are many other people like us who will continue to do it.<\/p>  <p>  If we closed the entire country, the difference would amount of 0.013% of global emissions.  We can see that Germany, China, Poland and many others have gone back to coal.  There is much talk about turf but no word about planes.  People need planes but we need a discussion about them.  There were 200,000 people flying out of the country last weekend.  We must have planes but the Government's focus seems to be on turf.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has gladly ensured more people are now cutting turf.<\/p>  <p>  I know somebody who has spent &euro;35,000 or &euro;40,000 on solar panels but gets nothing back for what they supply to the grid.  I know several others who are contemplating getting panels but they cannot get going because there is no assistance.  The Government is two years in office now and all it will be remembered for is increasing the carbon tax.<\/p>  <p>  We have several methods of creating alternative energy.  We are blessed with so many rivers.  Kenmare was electrified by the O'Sheas back in the 1930 when they set up turbines in the Sheen river.

As was already stated, the Government closed Bord na M&oacute;na without thinking it through and we are now bringing in briquettes from Germany.  Nobody thought of or mentioned the horticultural industry until one day in here I started a debate about it.  All of a sudden, everybody woke up and realised that the Government had completely forgotten about horticulture and peat was required in that very important industry.  Anything that has replaced it since is not as good as what we had ourselves.  The Government threw the entire industry to the wolves.  Now that I mention wolves, there is a Minister who wants to reintroduce those wolves to the country.  That is a different subject.<\/p><p>There are unprecedented increases in the basic necessities of life, including fuel to power and heat this country.  The Government seems to be completely ignoring the fact that other parts of the world are waking up to this.  The Green Party in Germany, for example, had a minister announcing plans to reopen coal mines.  How long will it take for the people here to realise that we will have to start looking at reintroducing licences for people to drill off our coasts?  There was nothing whatever wrong in doing that.  People will have to realise that we must consider using everything, from turf to renewables like solar or wind farms.  We should not narrow the focus to leave us so vulnerable that something like what is happening with Russia can lead to the tap being turned off, leaving us high and dry.  That is wrong.<\/p><p>I welcome that last week the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, came to Kerry and Mr. Tom O'Shea from Spunkane in Waterville presented him with a sod of turf.  I am very glad it was in front of him for over two hours because he got a good chance to look at it, think about it and know that he was in Killarney in County Kerry, which has a proud tradition of saving turf.  During the war, when turf was needed, where was it supplied from but all over the country, including County Kerry.  People left Kerry and went working on the Bog of Allen.  Great jobs were created by Bord na M&oacute;na over the years but there is nonsense spouted about going from brown to green.  People should read the book <i>Brown Gold: A History of Bord na M&oacute;na and the Irish Peat Industry<\/i>, and after that they might realise the mistake made with Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.

When the Green Party came into power, it insisted that it be taken out of the programme and not put in again.  That was an unusual act because it seems it was suitable for one programme for Government but not the next.  There are now members of the Cabinet objecting to it, which is a disgrace.  I was very glad to attend a meeting recently where I complimented local Fine Gael councillors who went against the leader of their party in stating very publicly their full support of Shannon LNG, as others did.<\/p> <p>That is what we want.  We want a liquefied natural gas facility because it is badly needed.  The war has compounded that and shown it up to be a fact.  The sooner the Minister of State and the rest of the Government wake up to that reality, the better for the people of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800035#KK00300","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656439800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The Rural Independent Group asked for the opening of oil and gas exploration, against which the Minister of State voted here in this House, until we have an alternative.  Central Statistics Office figures show that the data centres used 14% of our metered electricity last year, now rising to 30%.  The European Commission in 2020 put data centres as using 2.7%.  We are at 14% and we are heading to 30%.  Where is our energy security?  We must produce our own energy, otherwise we will continue to import all our energy needs.  Put into the mix our current relations with the UK and the war in Ukraine.  Is that our energy security?  Many reports were leaked over the weekend warning that we will run out of electricity in the next five winters.  That is not that far away.  The Government is going to run out of road by the time the next election comes.<\/p>  <p>  I had a stall at an agricultural show for the first time in Charleville in County Cork, just my neighbouring parish.  Some 99% of the vehicles with the cattle and all the produce that came to this agricultural show were petrol and diesel vehicles.  They have no alternative and if they had, they could not afford it.  What does the Government do?  It bans peat harvesting and extraction of energy sources.  Where is its plan for alternatives?  Lots of talk but no action; there is no surprise there.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is an island surrounded by water yet there is no mention of tidal energy or wave energy resulting in cheap hydro-energy.  Is there any update on the hydroelectricity?  Gas generates 46% of Ireland's total electricity needs.  Wind generated between 30% and 40%.  In 2021, because the wind did not blow, it only generated 29% of Ireland's electricity.  We are totally dependent on gas to supply our electricity.  The Rural Independents Group is the only Opposition grouping that has been constant since the very start of this Thirty-third D&aacute;il and before in our views of having fuel for the country until we have an alternative.  We are 0.001 on emissions.  The Government is going across the whole world and ships are coming in every day with fossil fuels when we have a natural resource off the coast of Ireland which would take out all the global shipping costs.  It has been mentioned before.  It is the same skies.  Again, with horticulture it is saying there is no alternative to imports.  Let us close down Bord na M&oacute;na.  Let us close down everything.  It goes back to what I stated at the very start.  The Cabinet is city based and has no experience outside the city.  Ministers seem to think they can walk to a shop and the stuff just appears there.  My God, it is magic.  They have no concept of how this country runs.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I was at the agricultural show.  It took me a day to recover with the amount of people who came to me, not only the elderly but young people saying they could not afford their apprenticeships.  These are the trades we want to encourage to rebuild Ireland.  They said with the cost of living they cannot afford it.  The Government is so out of touch with reality.  We should protect what we have now, have alternatives and then create change.  No, they want to create change with no alternatives.  The alternative will be a different Government come the next election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800036#LL00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1656439800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>While Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill, it is a direct consequence of the failure of the Government and the ones that came before it to prepare for increased demand with changing demographics and, of course, the prevalence of energy-hungry data centres.  This Bill will allow EirGrid to acquire new emergency electricity generation capacity.  This will be done by increasing EirGrid's borrowing limit and that of Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is being done because policies of this Government have taken on additional demand for electricity but have not made any provisions to meet the increased demand.  That is particularly the case in the area of data centres.  The last Fine Gael Government rolled out the red carpet for data centres and sought to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world with no thought about the impact this would have on our electricity supply.  Today we are dealing with the consequences.  The pressure these centres are putting on the grid is immense.  They are now using 14% of all our electricity, as much as all the homes in rural Ireland combined.  This is set to rise to at least 30% of all the State's electricity by 2030.  While the ESRI estimates that nearly a third of Irish households are experiencing energy poverty, we are dealing with the possibility of blackouts because the last Fine Gael-led Government did not make provision for the strain data centres would put on supply and ultimately the availability of electricity for households.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill, when passed, will see EirGrid's borrowing limit increase to &euro;3 billion to allow for investment in the Celtic interconnector with France and other investments that are necessary to ensure the grid can accommodate up to 80% renewable energy by 2030.  While we will support the Bill, in our amendments we are asking for information about the procurement of these additional generators to be shared with the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  We also need to see a report on the policy failures that led us to the point where we need to procure emergency additional capacity.  Those who brought us towards this situation need to be held to account.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also increase Bord na M&oacute;na's borrowing capacity to &euro;650 million to help it fund its expansion into renewable energy.  This is welcome because we need the State to retain as much ownership as possible of our energy production capacity.  We also need to see real progress in the provision of renewable energy, again with the State retaining ownership.  Finally, we need to see the publication of the energy security review so we can accurately assess the threat we are faced with in terms of our ability to provide for this country, especially when we have to prepare for the future in the midst of increasing international uncertainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800036#LL00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1656439800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  In the last few hours it was on the news that the G7 has said very clearly that unfortunately for them, because of the situation that is evolving, they are now making sure about fuel security and that fossil fuels have to be used more.  I have said this for the last few years but people did not want to listen.  That is the reality because of the situation and they have to just live with it.  A bit of reality has to come into it.  Why have we a shortage of power here?  Why have we amber alerts?  There are more people working, thankfully, but there were also stations that needed refurbishment and we lost Bord na M&oacute;na.  We lost Bord na M&oacute;na because of EU law.  The environmentalists went to the courts here and made sure to try to stop it.  Unfortunately, no Government since has decided to try to repeal any of those laws.  That is the reality, no more than the horticulture sector.  Bord na M&oacute;na has been shut down for the last few years and now it is coming home to bite.  While no one has a problem with offshore wind, and I hope I am proved wrong, to get everything up and running we are talking about 2030 between planning and all the different things.  I saw the other day in Killybegs there was an agreement signed with the fishermen.<\/p> <p>However, going through all the different processes that are needed, and the same environmentalists will probably object again regarding the Porcupine Bank off the west coast and so on, will slow the job down.  The wind is not consistent enough inland, so there is no point.  There are days when we do not have wind and we have to up the ante on gas especially. <\/p> <p> Deputies asked if there will be additional emissions in this country.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong but my understanding is that energy produced for electricity supply is part of the European Union emissions trading scheme, ETS, and it is not counted in the country producing it.  The ESB was given 1 million carbon credits under the ETS free of charge when it was burning peat in power stations.  The same was done in other countries.  Where have the 1 million carbon credits gone?  They were surely worth &euro;24 or &euro;25 each, which makes &euro;24 million or &euro;25 million.  Who has them or where are have they gone?  That is a big question.<\/p> <p> The Green Party is in government in Germany and today it had to announce the reopening of the coal mines, as the Minister of State said.<\/p> <p> There is a huge opportunity in energy.  We have the likes of anaerobic digestion but nothing is being done on it.  Right around the country people are crying out to have a go at that.  There is solar power from farm buildings and all of that.  There is a move starting but everything is so slowly that it is not counteracting.  People are probably worried, especially about prices.  We will get an interconnector with France but we do want nuclear anywhere in this country.  Everyone nearly jumps up in the air when they hear about it.  However, we do not mind taking in the 450 MW of electricity that will come in from the interconnector in a year or two.<\/p> <p> I presume the new generators will be gas powered.  The Minister of State might let me know if that is right.  They will probably be on the east coast because the gas pipeline is mostly in the east.  What I cannot fathom is that we do not want an LNG terminal below in the Chair's area but we are happy to take it in through a pipe from the UK or wherever else.  It is all right if it comes through a pipe but it is not all right to create a few jobs in areas where we require them.  I cannot fathom that mentality.  Whether we like it or not or whether people jump up and down or not, the reality is that for the next 30 or 40 years, we will definitely be relying on gas and, in my opinion, a fair amount of diesel as well.  We have to face up to these facts.  The wind does not always blow.  If we go offshore, we have a better chance of having wind constantly but the Atlantic has not been tested with offshore turbines.  The Atlantic is a ferocious beast when the wind is blowing at full throttle at night or in the day.  It is one of the toughest seas.  While offshore wind has worked, in fairness, off the east coast, which is great, there is a problem there.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the provision that people will get a &euro;75 refund.  We should acknowledge and welcome what is good in a Bill.  The sooner the refund is in place, the better.  Given all the amber alerts we have experienced in the past 18 months, people do not have a problem with making sure we have energy security.  We must have it; that is the bottom line.  However we draw or achieve that, we have to do it.  The Government or the ESB has to do it.  We have to make sure we do not let the lights go out in the country, as happened in Sri Lanka yesterday where the lights went out because not enough fuel got into the country.  We do not want to see situations like that.  We must make sure of two things.  First, we must have food security, and I worry about the road farmers are being brought down at the moment.  Second, we need energy security.  If you do not provide those two basics for your people, you are in serious trouble.<\/p> <p> I will now talk about how valuable a sod of turf will be to ordinary people next winter.  I was talking to a fuel merchant yesterday.  An ordinary bag of coal cost &euro;22 last year.  The price went to &euro;27, then &euro;35 and then &euro;42, and it is expected to be &euro;50 next winter.  An ordinary person cannot afford that.  The bit of turf that people cut if they rent a plot for &euro;500 or &euro;600 will do them for the winter.  People can jump up and down.  In ten or 12 years&rsquo; time, that generation will have moved on to something else.  Have a look at the bag of coal costing &euro;22 that will cost &euro;50.  Can we blame people for looking for alternatives?  The bottom line is they need to do so.  There will not be enough money to go around for everyone.  Those people will act on their own initiative and make sure they get what they need.<\/p> <p> I am blue in the face hearing about renewables and all of this.  People need to get into their heads that no one has a problem with new technology or new stuff coming.  I read an interesting article the day before yesterday.  A columnist in one of the newspapers wrote six years ago that we would have self-driving cars and people would be able to sit in them and they would go around the place.  It would be hunky-dory and everything would be lovely.  He acknowledged in the article I read that he was wrong, and fair play to him for admitting it.  I have been hearing about renewables for the past ten or 12 years.  There are some renewables and we are able to cater for more of them but if we look at the technologies that are coming, we are ten or 20 years away from perfecting hydrogen, offshore wind and so on.  We need to live in the real world and acknowledge that we have to use these other fuels for that length of time.  We will have to straddle them or have them side by side.  We must not knock off the light in one room to find when we go into another room that the light will not turn on.  In other words, do not go telling people they cannot use something and then when they look to renewables they find they do not work.  I want to let Deputy Connolly speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800036#LL00400","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656440400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to look at this legislation.  I am horrified by Deputy Leddin's comments and the ill-informed content of some of the debate.  He talked about the data centre trove.  I rarely personalise debate but I certainly find it a little worrying that information could be twisted in such a way by a Green Party Deputy.  We have here legislation for which the date for amendments has already passed and the Bill digest was only produced today.  We have one go at discussing this.  I have done been my best and struggled with this legislation.  The Deputy spoke about ill-informed comments.  The best way to avoid ill-informed comments is to allow for a considered debate with maximum information, and that has not happened here.  It has not happened in the context of this urgent legislation.  I fully understand that we need security of energy supply and the Bill is ostensibly about protecting the security of energy supply, as well as providing for a refund of the PSO levy, allowing for Bord na M&oacute;na and EirGrid to borrow more money and allowing the Government to give EirGrid money in the context of a direction from the CRU in relation to security supply.  On a theoretical level, I fully understand where this legislation is coming from.  What I do not understand is why it is being presented in such an urgent manner, with the date for tabling amendments having passed before we even discussed Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>I have struggled, and while I have some idea, it is not clear to me what we are doing here.  For Deputy Leddin to talk about ill-informed comments is totally unacceptable, given the Government has allowed this situation to develop.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Naughten referred to the Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy, which was an absolute hymn of adoration to data centres, with no restriction whatsoever, back in June 2018.  Less than a year later, we were declaring a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency.  We have still had no review of that policy.  The biggest thing the Government wanted to do under that policy was to classify data centres as strategic infrastructure and to change the legislation to allow them to be put through.  It was stated, &ldquo;This statement outlines the role data centres play in Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be a digital economy hot-spot in Europe.&rdquo;  We are certainly a hot-spot in more ways than one.  It went on &ldquo;The Government is amending the planning process for data centres over certain size thresholds to reclassify them as strategic infrastructure&rdquo;.  Again, for the benefit of the person who made the comment about ill-informed comments, let us look at what else was said in the statement, which continued, &ldquo;While investments in a range of sectors are utility intensive and will increase demand, it is important to acknowledge that data centres pose considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s power system.&rdquo;  This warning was given in June 2018.  It also stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tSuch challenges arise in terms of renewable energy policy\/objectives ... community acceptance ... By recognising these challenges, [which were clearly outlined] the Government can take steps to mitigate them so that Ireland optimises the benefits that these strategically important investments bring. <\/blockquote> <p>The challenges were recognised and steps were to be taken, which clearly were not taken.  It is a very short document and it clearly was ignored.  On page 12, it is stated, &ldquo;The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities ... plans to work with EirGrid to develop a range of measures, potentially including locational signals, to ensure that local and regional security of electricity supply is maintained and to facilitate demand growth associated with data centres&rdquo;, and, of course, other high energy user companies as well.<br\/><br\/>Here we are today, looking at a Bill with 14 sections, ostensibly to protect our security, and we are rushing it through.  There is no pre-legislative scrutiny, no regulatory impact assessment and no proper time to tease out the issues.  We have a situation where the risks were clearly highlighted years ago and we failed to act on those risks.  Today, we have no analysis and we just have to take the Government's assurance in regard to this matter, where the market we have glorified has failed.  This is an acknowledgement the market has failed.  The Government is now stepping in to help the market until it performs again in the manner we want it to perform in.  We are going to allow EirGrid to acquire plant infrastructure and then we are going to direct it to sell it.  It cannot operate the infrastructure itself because it is a network and it distributes, but it is going to be used to buy a plant network, including acquiring electricity generation plants.  The way energy plant and electricity plant is used is very strange.  We are not told anything about how those plants will be fuelled.  We are not told how it will be sold to the operator.  There is a sunset clause with a built-in extension, so we are talking about five to six years.  Then, that operator will be told to sell it off at arm&rsquo;s length and something will come back to the Government, but we have no idea about that.  Does that not sound totally bizarre?<br\/><br\/>At the very least, we should acknowledge there is clearly a warning to us that the State should be involved in regard to utility provision, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith outlined earlier.  If we have learned anything, it is that we cannot continue on with the growth model.  Of course, I want a thriving economy, but I have learned that a thriving economy as defined by neoliberalism is a disaster.  We have had Covid, we have declared two emergencies and we are still going ahead, boasting that Ireland is one of the fastest growing countries in Europe and the world.  We do not seem to realise we must question that model.  We must question data centres.  Of course, they have a role and, of course, we need them, but we need to question what is their role and how they can be sustainable.<br\/><br\/>We have looked at the capacity statement from EirGrid from more than a year ago and it told us there were four options.  The one that is currently in place is the developer-led model, as set out in the statement from EirGrid as a prelude to its consultation.  Nowhere in the speech given today by the Minister of State is there any context about where we are now going as a small country with, in theory, fantastic supplies of wind, water and sun, actually, and how we are going to use those sources of energy so we can have independence and maximise the output to the people, so we bring them on board, as opposed to the endless consumption model we are working from.  At the very least, there might be an apology for having had no review of the data centres, for the hymn of praise back in 2018, and for not knowing where the review is, or there might be a recognition that there has to be fundamental change.  EirGrid&rsquo;s all-island generation capacity statement outlines that data centres could account for 23% of energy demand.  This is a median estimate and not even the worst scenario, and we have in excess of 70 data centres at the moment.<br\/><br\/>I have repeatedly stood up in the House and said I am an absolute supporter of the Green Party in its recognition of a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency, but what is happening here is that we are pretending we can go on with an endless consumption model and deal with a climate emergency.  It is not possible.  What we are doing here today is rushing through legislation in the guise of an emergency when that emergency has been apparent for years.  We are twisting language on its head and talking about ill-informed comment when all of that has been allowed by the Government in the manner in which it is rushing this legislation through without context, without discussion and without allowing us to see what all of this actually means, when EirGrid buys an electricity plant and then sells it on.  Does that not make us question what is going on here in regard to market failure and what we learn from that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800037#MM00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656441000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their insightful comments on this emergency legislation.  It is, indeed, emergency legislation.  We are trying to address an immediate problem, the security of electricity supply, and to get more credit to people's electricity accounts for the coming winter.  It is vital we deliver this legislation to enable these priorities.  I appreciate the Deputies&rsquo; comments and I appreciate the widespread support from Deputies from all parties that there is a need for secure electricity supplies and for credits to be given to electricity customers, even if there are other things we should do as well.  There were a broad range of contributions, including on renewables, the cost of living, data centres and the role of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  I will keep my comments focused on this Bill.  I am going to address some of the contributions of Deputies but I will not be able to do them all justice right now, and I think we can address them better on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>One general question was why are we legislating in this emergency way.  Our general direction of travel on climate action is towards an electrification of society.  We are moving towards our transport being electrically powered, both public and private transport, and moving towards our homes being powered by electricity because heat pumps are powered by electricity.  We are moving towards a general electrification of everything and at the same time a reduction in use and in demand wherever we can through a circular economy.  That means more electricity.  This Government has decided to move faster towards our emission cuts, which means more electricity towards 2030.<\/p> <p> However, anyone who has travelled around the world in the past few years without going very far will have noticed, including just north of the Border, solar panels on roofs, in Wales offshore wind turbines on the horizon and in Germany anaerobic digesters in every village.  One might wonder why that is not happening here.  It did not happen here for the last decade so here we are.  We are where we are.  What has to be done now is to legislate for this.  There will be an independent review into the reasons we are in this situation.  That said, there are some direct questions about these new generators that I will quickly address.  How are they to be powered?  They will likely be powered by a combination of gas or distillate although that has not been specified.  Are they to be used all the time as general generation?  They will not.  They are intended to be used as a last resort.  They are peaking power to be used on a day when there is no wind or a number of generators have gone down for whatever reason and these are needed in an emergency.  That is their intended purpose.  What will happen to them afterwards?  They will be sold and removed from the grid.  What is the source of the &euro;350 million?  That money will be added as a supplementary estimate to the budget to Vote 29 this year which will have to be voted on by the Oireachtas.  It will be used for upfront capital costs to EirGrid.<\/p> <p> My overarching message is that it is critical that the provisions in this Bill are put in place before the summer recess to ensure security of supply and to provide a PSO credit to electricity customers.  I seek the support of the House to achieve that.  I appreciate the supportive comments from Sinn F&eacute;in earlier.  It is a matter of serious concern to the Government that recent electricity and gas price increases caused by international conditions are putting increasing pressure on consumers, especially those in a more vulnerable economic position.  I appreciate the important points that Deputies have made on the pressure being felt by many households from the rise in the cost of living.  It is important to see the PSO credited as a benefit provision in this Bill as one of a suite of measures being taken by Government.<\/p> <p> The provisions to enable EirGrid to deliver on the CRU&rsquo;s direction to procure about 450 MW of temporary generation capacity are vital to the secure supply of electricity for the coming years.  I seek the support of the House to deliver these provisions.  The Government is determined to act quickly to help people further with these high energy prices.  It is worth restating the purpose of the Bill as well as the operation of the emergency measures.  The Bill provides for the CRU to direct that the PSO for the coming PSO year can be credited as a benefit to electricity customers.  It also provides for EirGrid to purchase temporary backup generation units and to negotiate with generators to deliver this backup capacity over the coming years to bridge the gap in our transition to an electricity grid which comprises up to 80% renewable energy by 2030.  In general I appreciate the support of Deputies across the House in this.  It is a practical thing.  It is emergency legislation and I look forward to continuing in more detail to answer Deputies' questions on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800038#NN00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656441600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800039#OO00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Emergency Budget: Motion [Private Members]","time":1656441600,"counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800039#OO00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1656441600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>recognises that:  \t&mdash;\u00a0citizens are struggling with the rising cost of living and need action from the Government now;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;\u00a0the Government cannot protect everyone from the full impact of every price increase, some of which are being driven by international factors beyond its control;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;\u00a0the Government is now projected to take in &euro;5.6 billion more in tax revenue this year than had been expected on Budget day;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;\u00a0the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have advised that there is scope for additional measures to support the cost of living; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;\u00a0the Government can and must do more to support workers and families, and should do so now;  <\/blockquote>  <p>condemns:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \t&mdash;\u00a0the hardship, anxiety and desperation being felt by households across the country, as a direct result of the Government's refusal to introduce measures to support workers and families at this time; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;\u00a0the dismissive attitude of the Government party leaders towards calls from workers, families, stakeholder groups and representatives for measures to address the cost-of-living crisis now;  commends the Cost of Living Coalition and the thousands of citizens who took to the streets to demand immediate measures from the Government to address the rising cost of living; and<br \/><br \/>calls for the immediate introduction of an emergency Budget, to introduce and extend further supports to workers and families to support them with the many high and rising costs they are now facing. <\/blockquote>  <p>T&aacute; oibrithe agus teaghlaigh amuigh ansin i ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im mar gheall ar an chostas maireacht&aacute;la.

Last month inflation reached its highest levels for almost 40 years.  Faced with rising energy bills, growing food costs and crippling rents many struggle to make it to the end of the week.  A recent report by the ESRI found that one in three households live in energy poverty.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has seen calls for help skyrocket.  The number of people going to food banks has tripled.  Families who in the past made donations to charities are now approaching the very same charities for food parcels and for help, something they never imagined they would have to do.  Others face the impossible choices of whether to turn off the heating or skip a meal.  The time for action is not in four months' time, it is now.  For months Sinn F&eacute;in has called on this Government to wake up to the hardship so many face and to respond to the emergency through an emergency budget providing immediate support to lower- and middle-income households.  For months those calls have fallen on the deaf ears of a Government that has told struggling households to buckle up, brace themselves and that they are on their own, a Government that has told them that they need to wait.  Workers and families cannot afford to wait and should not have to wait.  We have had Ministers absolve themselves of responsibility and advised struggling families with fuel costs to head down to their local social welfare offices.  It is simply unacceptable.  Government has a moral responsibility to support households and to protect the most vulnerable during these times of hardship.<\/p><p>We in Sinn F&eacute;in recognise that not everybody can be fully insulated from every price increase we are seeing.  However, the Government can and must do more.  Even the Central Bank of Ireland, the State&rsquo;s financial watchdog, has said there is scope to act to provide further support to struggling workers and families.  We need an emergency budget before this D&aacute;il breaks for the summer, one that helps workers and families weather the storm by introducing a cost of living cash payment to lower- and middle-income families and by increasing social welfare rates and pension payments in response to inflation.  In the past year rising prices have fast outstripped welfare payments leaving the most vulnerable in our society exposed to the hardship of poverty and that is a disgrace.  We need an emergency budget that increases the minimum wage and boosts the income of low-paid workers.  The one-third of households which rely on home-heating oil has seen that price double in the past year without any relief.  Despite the Government being able to cut the cost of a fill by more than &euro;100 per tank, it has refused to do so.  We need an emergency budget that will provide that relief by removing excise duty on home-heating oil.  For motorists who have no other option but to use the car to travel to work, to visit sick relatives or to leave their children to school, we need an emergency budget that would cut petrol and diesel prices at the pump by the maximum amount possible.  This can and should be done.  As prices rise the State&rsquo;s tax take from VAT also increases.  Support for households is overdue.  We need to give something back to these households now.<\/p><p>Every household faces a cost of living crisis differently.  For those facing what is almost a second mortgage through childcare, the Government can and should cut childcare fees by one third this year.  In regard to renters struggling to cope with crippling rent an emergency budget could and should put a month&rsquo;s rent back into renters&rsquo; pockets through a refundable tax credit.  Further rent increases should be banned.  These measures are affordable.  More importantly they are a commonsense solution to support struggling households.<\/p> <p>It is time, therefore, for the Government to get its head out of the sand, to wake up, do its job and act to protect those on low and middle incomes, because workers and families cannot afford to wait any longer for this Government to get its act together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800039#OO00400","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656442200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Forty years ago we were experiencing double-digit inflation and the Taoiseach of the time addressed the nation and said we were living beyond our means and needed to tighten our belts.

The belt cannot be tightened any further by the worker in the west who is struggling to make the trip to his badly needed job because he cannot pay the cost of going there five days a week, or the young couple who were spending most of their wages on rent even before this crisis and now wonder how in the name of God they will ever get married or have children.  Then there is the elderly woman who stays in one room all day long so she only has to heat it and goes to bed earlier so she can save on oil.  The reality is there are no other options left for these people.  They have done all they can.

I and others beside me understand the war is fuelling the inflation crisis.  We get that.  We get that there are external factors that are way beyond the control of this Government, but the Minister of State needs to understand that when families literally cannot put food on their tables, we need to do something.  We understand the Government cannot control the price of commodities.  We understand it cannot control what happens in a war zone.  However, it can control what happens here.  It can change the rate of excise duty.  It can increase cost-of-living payments.  It can put a month's rent back into renters' pockets.  This D&aacute;il and this Government are not some everyday onlooker.  Deputy Fleming is a Minister of State.  He and his Government have power.  They can act on what we have put forward in this motion and we need them to act on this.  We keep hearing from this Government that it cannot do everything.  We are not asking it to do everything but we are asking it to put forward the suggestions we have in the motion this evening.  They are easily implemented measures that would help those who need it most.<\/p>  <p>  We have often heard, and often heard it from this Government, that politics is about choices.  The Government is choosing to close its eyes to these measures.  This should not be about party politics.  This should be about doing what is best for the people.  We have decent measures here so we should work together and implement them.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State what he already knows, namely, that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank have all said the Government has scope to introduce additional measures to support households.  Indeed, IFAC and the OECD have said the Government's measures have not been targeted.  The Government calls us populist all the time.  Would the Minister of State call those bodies populist too?  If it is populist to point out that public finances have ample fiscal space for these measures then I guess the ESRI, the Central Bank and IFAC are populists.  If it is populist to point out the weakest in our society are the ones who are suffering most, then almost every community group and NGO in this State are populists.  If it is populist to want to protect people from this crisis and govern in a responsible way, then I guess every party not in government is populist.  What the Government calls populist, therefore, is what I call living in the real world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800040#PP00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1656442200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>After two years in Government together and a number of years of close co-operation beforehand, one would imagine the Government would be able to coalesce properly together.

The county is already disadvantaged by peripherality as it has three peninsulas, work that is both precarious and seasonal, and services that are farther away than those in nearly all other counties.  A dire choice is faced by many, that is, either work and lose money or stay at home and face a future that is just as uncertain.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying living standards are under threat, but basic security and physical and mental well-being are of the utmost concern.

I ask the Minister of State and the Government to act urgently and introduce an emergency budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic are cited by the Government as reasons for the increases in everyday prices.  The Russian invasion was even mentioned by the Taoiseach as causing all the increased anxiety in the country.  However, this Government and previous Governments cannot escape their own culpability.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il policies over the past ten years, going back to the financial crisis and the economic policies pursued since, have led to this.  They ceased to build social housing and outsourced it to private landlords, abolished the town councils and introduced direct provision.  Look how much the outsourcing of direct provision has cost over the years, with nothing now to show for it.  There are six to one room in the new accommodation in Killarney.  With no public control over investment or capital, the private sector has run rampant and is looking for a return on areas such as homes and housing.

Even some of the Government Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la know what people are going through and they do not agree with this.  The eyes of the country are on the Government and they are on the Teachta&iacute; in their constituencies to see what they are going to do when these proposals are put forward.  These are fully costed and sensible measures that will make a real difference in people's lives and they need to be taken.  Even the Tory government has had three emergency budgets, I think, in the past year and it is looking to a fourth one, yet the coalition here cannot do that.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting those most exposed to price increases is right and fair.  It is also economically prudent to protect people from inflation, as otherwise we see the damage to our domestic economy.  When people have no money left after half filling the tank, ordering the heating oil or even going grocery shopping, then workers and families suffer, but so does the wider economy.  The modified domestic demand, which is a better measure of domestic conditions than GDP, contracted by 1% year on year.  The Government almost seems to be embracing a recession and embracing the fact people are now paying household bills with credit cards.  They will pay huge amounts of interest on those credit cards in the next few months, so it is accumulating all the time.  All of this should be a warning that inflation is hitting the domestic economy.  We need a sensible approach to managing inflation.  We need to protect low- and middle-income workers and households from the worst impacts of price rises, guard against the domestic demand destruction, and protect the economy and jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State would have something to say if we did not have the money but we have it.  We have &euro;5.6 billion more in tax revenue this year than has been expected.  What we are missing is the political will.  Inaction and indecision is just not washing with people.  The Minister of State knows that and the Government knows that.  People know the Government is not listening.  It is saying hold out and it will make a big announcement in October.  The suffering and the pressure people are under and will be under from now until October and beyond is too much for them to bear.  Inaction and indecision in the face of inflation is the same as the harsh cuts that were seen during austerity.  Deputy Doherty put it very well on MidWest Radio today.  He said it is like telling the child or the family we know you are hungry today but you will be hungrier next week and we will do something about it then.  We will come along to the rescue then.

Inflation is at its highest in four decades and we are hearing stories from Barnardos and other organisations that this level of deprivation and poverty has not been seen since the 1980s.  This means real hunger, not being able to use electricity due to its high cost, and workers not being able to afford to fill their cars to get to work.  In winter, it will mean families going hungry and sitting in the cold.  As we head towards September, families will face extreme hardship in trying to get their children back to school.  They have no idea how they will pay for uniforms, shoes, winter coats, books and school supplies.<\/p>  <p>  While Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that international events have contributed to the increases in prices, it was disingenuous of the Taoiseach to blame the crisis in its entirety on the war in Ukraine.  Ireland was struggling with a cost-of-living crisis before the war.  People in Ireland pay way more for rent, childcare, utilities and most basics than people in other European countries, and have done so for many years.  In addition, people in Ireland have higher mortgage interest rates.  Since the war in Ukraine, the situation has been compounded to the stage where people are not able to survive.  Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, yet working people cannot afford to house and feed their families.  Young people are preparing to leave because they cannot afford to live here, even if they have decent jobs.<\/p>  <p>  There is plenty the Government can do now.  Ignoring the problem until the end of the year is a reckless dereliction of duty.

It tells us that it knows and understands, yet still it will not act.  The Government amendment to the motion says it all.  Of course, it says nothing new.  The Government is still speaking about social welfare increases that were announced eight months ago even though those social welfare increases of &euro;5 a week for most recipients came after two years of no increases at all while every weekly social welfare rate is set well below the poverty line.<\/p>  <p>  The Government speaks about the fuel allowance, which is extremely limited.  Workers cannot access it.  There is almost an intention to push a line that fuel allowance is related to fuel poverty or supports households at risk of fuel poverty.  As all present will be aware, there is no link between the fuel allowance and households that are in or at risk of fuel poverty.  If a person is getting a certain payment, he or she gets the fuel allowance regardless of whether he or she lives in an A-rated house.  It does not come into it.  The fuel allowance needs serious reform.  Eligibility needs to be widened.  It is not the be all and end all when it comes to supporting workers who cannot access it in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment goes on to state that there is a need for targeted measures.  We know that 87% of the measures the Government has brought in this year have not been targeted and that is why the situation has worsened.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council told the Government that.  It produced that figure of 80%.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment refers to the possibility of damaging our international cost competitiveness.  To stand back from it, what about the damage the Government is doing to households?  What about the damage it is doing to children, the consequences of which will remain with many of them for the rest of their lives, and the damage it is doing to the most vulnerable citizens - citizens who live with a disability, lone parents and family carers - who are struggling every day?  The Government response to them is that it does not wish to damage our international cost competitiveness.  Its other response is that it will wait until October.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that changes have been made to the additional needs payment.  Its name has been changed and there are new income limits and all of that is welcome but I again ask that it be moved online.

This facility should be online so that people can apply online, as is the case for many other social welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800041#QQ00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1656442800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:   \t&quot;notes that:  <blockquote> \t&mdash; the annual rate of consumer price inflation, as measured by the European Union's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, has picked up sharply in recent months, reaching a multi-decade high of 8.3 per cent in May; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the key driver of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine;  <br \/><br \/>&mdash; Budget 2022 contained a large range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living, including a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million next year and a social welfare package of over &euro;550 million; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; a further suite of measures amounting to &euro;505 million was announced on 10th February, 2022, with measures including an energy credit of &euro;200 (inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT)) to every household in the country, a once&mdash;off lump sum payment in respect of the Fuel Allowance, and a 20 per cent reduction in public transport fares; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; on 9th March, at an estimated cost of &euro;320 million, the Government agreed to VAT-inclusive reductions in excise duty of 20 cent per litre in respect of petrol, 15 cent per litre in respect of diesel and 2 cent per litre in respect of Marked Gas Oil;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in April and May, the Government announced a further set of measures amounting to almost &euro;500 million, including a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas to 9 per cent from 1st May until the end of October, an additional once-off lump sum payment in respect of the Fuel Allowance and the extension of the 9 per cent VAT rate for the hospitality sector until the end of February 2023; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; on a cumulative basis, this brings the total cost-of-living package to approximately &euro;2.4 billion; <\/blockquote>recognises that:  <blockquote> \t&mdash; the Government has been pro-active in limiting the fall-out from higher rates of inflation; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; this follows the extensive support provided to households and firms during the pandemic, where the Government made available &euro;48 billion of fiscal support, one of the most significant policy responses of any country in the world; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland's public debt is almost a quarter of a trillion euros as a result, and among the highest in the developed world on a per capita basis; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Ireland is a small open economy, where wage growth in excess of other economies erodes our competitiveness and puts future jobs and economic growth at risk; and <\/blockquote>acknowledges that:  <blockquote> \t&mdash; the recent rise in inflation is primarily the result of global factors and consequently largely beyond the reach of Government policy; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the recent increase in inflation is having a significant impact on the cost of living for Irish citizens; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; while the Government has already introduced a wide range of measures to mitigate the impacts of increases in the cost of living on citizens, it must pursue broadly neutral budgetary policy in order to contain domestic inflationary pressures; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; Government policy should focus on temporary and targeted measures, aimed at the most vulnerable; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; it is crucial that we do not have an inflation 'chain reaction' that would damage our international cost competitiveness; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; borrowing costs, including sovereign borrowing costs, are now on a rising trajectory, and accordingly, trade-offs are once again apparent and choices about tax and spending will have to be made, as revenue and expenditure will need to be aligned in order to avoid adding to the stock of debt; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the budgetary process is the best and most appropriate way to consider further action on the cost-of-living challenge and this issue must be addressed in a strategic, comprehensive and responsible manner.&quot; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the motion on an emergency budget, which the Government opposes.  As is well known, the budgetary process for budget 2023 is well under way.  The national economic dialogue took place last week and the summer economic statement will be published in the coming weeks.  The normal budgetary process is the best and most responsible framework for further policy discussions on this matter.<\/p><p>It is important to remember the current economic context.  After two years, we have finally put the worst impacts of the pandemic behind us.  The fiscal support provided by this Government was unprecedented in scale and scope.  This support was essential in laying the groundwork for a strong economic recovery when restrictions could be lifted.  We have seen such a recovery taking hold.  There are now more people at work in Ireland than ever before.  That is a remarkable statistic when considering the turmoil in the labour market during the pandemic.  As I speak, there are 2.5 million people in the workforce.  That is a record number and a very high proportion.  Despite that, many businesses are still having difficulty recruiting staff as a result of the extra spending in which people are engaging at this time.<\/p><p>Enabling this recovery has come at a significant cost, however.  Before the onset of the pandemic, we were in a position of financial strength.  The economy was operating at nearly full employment, the ratio of public debt to national income was moving in the right direction on a downward path, and there had been two successive years of budgetary surpluses for the first time since the financial crisis.  The Government acted swiftly and decisively, deploying all the financial firepower necessary to protect households and the wider economy.  Our fiscal resources were emptied as a result.  Since the start of 2020, we have run deficits of almost &euro;30 billion overall.  This year, in spite of the recovery, we still expect a record deficit.  It is important for people to recognise that it was as a result of the sound management of the economy in recent years that the economy was in a position to provide that &euro;30 billion that was much needed during Covid.  If finances had been run-down and our financial situation weaker, we would not have been in a position to do that.  The level of expenditure and support that we gave to working families, other families and business compare very well with the levels in any other country in the developed world.<\/p><p>This is a dangerous position for a small open economy to be in.  We know that, as we have seen clearly through the past two-and-a-half years, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to volatility in the global economy.  We must return the public finances to a sustainable trajectory.  I do not think any Member objects to that.  <\/p><p>The Government knows that people are struggling.  That is why we have acted numerous times throughout the year.  Taking into account the budget measures, most of which came in earlier this year, and the income tax and social welfare packages, we have provided almost &euro;2.4 billion in support to assist those dealing with the cost-of-living challenge.  This support has been particularly targeted at helping the most vulnerable and those least able to absorb increased costs, including multiple lump sum payments in respect of the fuel allowance.  That has been done at various times.  Some people claim those measures are not targeted.  Members of the Opposition have quoted certain figures.  The measures consistently proposed in this Chamber day in, day out by the main Opposition parties to reduce tax and levies on petrol and diesel are precisely the measures that the organisations in question have said are not targeted.  People driving big cars to work would be the principal beneficiaries of such measures.  The Government has taken a different approach.  I refer to the ESRI report that was published a week ago and dealt with the exact same measure.  It took a more understanding approach on this issue and acknowledged that the social welfare fuel allowance increases and items like that were the most targeted and effective.  It went on to state that the &euro;200 off people's electricity bills meant more to people on lower incomes than it did to people on higher incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800041#QQ00300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1656443400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>It did not say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800042#RR00100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1656443400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>It said the measure proportionately benefited people on lower incomes compared with those on higher incomes.

Another report noted that measures to reduce taxes and levies on diesel and petrol, which Sinn F&eacute;in calls for every day of the week, are the least targeted measures.  It is important to say that.  Most people will agree we must target our resources where they will have the most effect.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the Opposition accepts that we cannot fully absorb the impact of inflation.  It is a global challenge, which, apart from the impact of the Covid pandemic, is due to Putin's war.  I will repeat that.  Most of the difficulties we are having in regard to fuel supplies and prices are due to Putin's war.  If that war were not happening, we might not be in the position we are in today.  We cannot skirt over that.<\/p>  <p>  I understand why the Opposition has tabled this motion.  It is easy and very popular to say we should always spend more.  Those of us in government understand that but we have a greater responsibility to look after the broader picture, not just for this week but for next week, next month and next year.  We have shown we are not afraid to act when needed, but we will not act in a reckless manner.  Fiscal policy that is poorly designed can backfire.  We could end up making inflation worse and chasing inflation.  It is not a viable option for the Government to try to respond to every change in inflation on a weekly or monthly basis.  We would only end up chasing our tails as we exacerbate the problem we are trying to address.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, the Government will outline its budgetary strategy in the summer economic statement, which will be published in the coming weeks.  It will set out the budgetary stance for next year and how we will return our finances to a stable trajectory.  We will target the lowest viable level of borrowing to bring our deficit under control, while still allowing us the flexibility to intervene in a targeted way wherever and whenever that is needed.   In an environment in which interest rates are rising, this is the only course of action to take.  People are feeling that rise in their mortgage payments and the State feels it as well in respect of servicing public debt.  We will continue to reduce the ratio of our public debt to income, which will help with the cost-of-living challenge in a targeted, responsible way.  We will reduce the reliance of the public finances on highly volatile corporation tax receipts, which, as mentioned on a regular basis in the House, have made the headline budgetary figures look misleadingly positive.  These receipts cannot be guaranteed to continue year after year into the future.  We cannot bank on always having them.  While the numbers might look very positive right now, there is no guarantee that will be the case next year, when we will still be dealing with cost-of-living issues.  Inflation will not disappear in only a few months.<\/p>  <p>  The Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will present budget 2023 to the House in the not too distant future.  As we have stated, it will contain measures that will substantially deal with increases in the cost of living and how they affect individuals, workers, families and those who are most vulnerable.  Discussions during the budgetary process are the appropriate forum for designating policy interventions that are best suited for the current conditions.  Through dialogue with stakeholders, we will introduce a budget that continues to return our public finances to a sustainable level, while also acting responsibly to help those most in need.  At the same time, we do not want to fan inflation because that immediately will make everybody's situation worse.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the challenges people are facing.  We encounter them on a daily basis on the street and in our clinics.  That is why we have brought forward a number of measures to deal with them.  We have demonstrated that we will respond in every way we can to mitigate the costs of inflation.  We will continue to respond as appropriately and as best we can.  I will not go into the details of the various measures we have introduced during the year.  Those measures are in place and are indicative of what the Government will do into the future.  It has been suggested that we are waiting until the end of the year to take further action.  In fact, the measures we introduce will be brought forward in a few months, not at the end of the year.  The calls for an emergency budget have not been fully thought through.  Budget 2023 will soon be announced and it is through the normal budgetary process that we can most successfully address the cost-of-living challenge without jeopardising the long-term stability of our economy and, at the same time, protect the people in Ireland who are most vulnerable in these difficult financial times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800042#RR00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656443400,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1656443400,"counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800042#RR00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1656443400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Richard O'Donoghue - to discuss plans for an investigation into the management of University Hospital Limerick;

Our proposals would provide much-needed supports for workers and families, who deserve and need a break.  The State is projected to take in &euro;5.6 billion more in tax revenue this year than was expected when budget 2022 was framed.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling for &euro;874 million to go into an emergency budget.<\/p>  <p>  Workers have been hit by transport costs and the rising cost of home heating oil.  As the Minister of State knows, transport costs are affecting workers who have to travel long distances to work the most, including workers in counties Laois and Offaly.  Our emergency budget is targeted and would reduce excise duty on petrol and diesel and remove excise from home heating oil completely.  It would provide a once-off cash payment for low- and middle-income workers, increase the minimum wage and ensure low-paid workers get fuel allowance.  It would cut childcare fees by 33% and increase the back to school allowance for children.  It also would increase pension payments by &euro;7.50 per week and provide renters with a tax refund of one month's rent.  The Government must move now to help renters, which the Minister of State has not done so far.  Our emergency budget is fully costed and is only giving workers back a share of their contribution to the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Big business seldom wastes a good crisis.  Last year, GDP hit an all-time high of &euro;404 billion.  The volume of goods and services produced has increased massively in spite of the Covid crisis and the war in Ukraine.  I acknowledge that both those events are having an economic effect.  We understand that.  However, despite GDP skyrocketing last year, ordinary citizens have seen a huge reduction in their spending power.  Has all the wealth disappeared?  No, it has not.  What we are witnessing is a massive transfer of wealth from the workers who produce it to a smaller and smaller wealthy elite that extracts more and more out of the economy.  Our emergency budget is an attempt to address some of that imbalance.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot continue to ignore the cost-of-living crisis and the ever increasing struggle of the workers and families its members meet every week.  It is a fact that we have one of the highest mortgage interest rates in Europe, some of the highest gas and electricity prices, sky-high rents and childcare costs that have gone through the roof.  These issues cannot be ignored.  The Minister of State is correct that these matters would normally be dealt with by way of the budgetary process, but we are not in normal times.  We need an emergency budget and we need it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800042#RR00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1656443400,"counter":358,"content":"<p>We are calling on the Government to introduce an emergency budget to deal with the rising cost of living.  None of us should have to make a speech outlining the challenges facing families.  We see the evidence of that every day.  Many of the people to whom I speak say they are at their wit's end and do not know how they will pay the next bill.  They are dreading the postman coming up the driveway to deliver more of them.  When one pulls into a garage, one sees straight away the increase in the cost of petrol and diesel.  When people go for a fill of home heating oil, they see the difference in price.  People are telling me the rising cost of food bills is impacting on their families.<\/p> <p>Everything is going up, but wages are certainly not going up to match.  We know the costs of renting a room.  The cost of trying to get rental accommodation is above and beyond the ability of most people now.  Therefore, people are travelling further and further when they are trying to get to work and trying to keep their jobs, but they are taking home less and less income.  What we are asking for, and what people are calling for, are more supports.<\/p> <p> The founder of Ballycullen food bank described the demand for its services last month in the context of eat or heat.  The demand has more than doubled in just the last few weeks.  I was talking to people at a meeting I had last night.  We were going through the number of food banks that have been established in many communities and in many community centres right across my constituency.  I argue, again, that this is probably happening in the constituency of every TD in the Chamber.  We are saying that people cannot wait.  When the Government is asked about this issue, the response is that it has to wait until October.  People cannot wait until October.  The message we are sending out tonight is that we are appealing to TDs of all parties and none to think again, to think of their constituencies and to think of the challenges facing the families out there and to deliver an emergency budget.

People are under real pressure to cover the price of the basic essentials they cannot do without.  Listening to the Taoiseach this morning, we would think that Putin was the cause of all the Government's failures.

Therefore, the money is there to act and the Government must act.  Action can and should be taken immediately to provide support for those facing the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  A recent national survey commissioned by Barnardos revealed that almost two-thirds, some 63%, of people and their children who participated had to go without essentials such as heat, electricity, food and clothing during the last six months due to the cost-of-living crisis.  More than one-quarter of parents have had to cut back or have gone without heat and almost one in four have cut back or gone without electricity.  A report from EUROSTAT showed that \"overall prices are 40% higher [in Ireland] compared with the average in the EU\" and that \"Combined housing costs such as rents, mortgage rates, gas and electricity, are again the most expensive\" here, at 89% above the EU average, while healthcare costs \"are the most expensive in the EU, at a staggering 72% above the [EU] average\".<\/p>  <p>  This is Ireland in 2022.

This is a comment and a reference that will resonate with many people.  The difference, however, between 2008 and 2022 is that we have the resources now, if properly targeted, to insulate those who are less well-off and to help those struggling on middle incomes to get by and to make ends meet.<\/p>  <p>  We back and enthusiastically support this motion from Sinn F&eacute;in, but our calls for an emergency budget are genuine and sincere as well.  They are made in an effort to be constructive, as my colleague and the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Bacik, said to the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions earlier.  Our first call for a comprehensive set of budgetary measures and action of this nature was not made today, yesterday, last week or even last month.  As far back as January, in a detailed motion brought to the floor of this House, we presented a comprehensive set of targeted and costed proposals to help people to make ends meet better during this challenging cost-of-living crisis.  That package was valued at &euro;1.5 billion.  Some of these proposals, and we have to be fair to the Government, have since been implemented, such as the cut to the excise duty rate on fuel.  It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  That package was of course proposed when Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine was only then the stuff of speculation and intelligence reports.  We all know the world has changed incredibly since.  Of course, everything comes a distant second place to the incredible suffering of the people of Ukraine and the millions who have been displaced internally and externally.  More must be done, however, to insulate better the hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens at the very sharpest end of the cost-of-living crisis.  This crisis is real.  It is real, it is here and it is impacting now.  It is being experienced and being lived now, not in October 2022, but now at the end of June 2022.  Without comprehensive action therefore we will not only be facing into a winter of discontent, but it will also be a cruel summer for those on fixed low and middle incomes as they digest the news reported in the recent Kantar bulletin, which got a great deal of media attention in recent days, that basic shopping will cost an additional &euro;450 or so this year.  To put this into context, this is more than the gross weekly salary of someone on the national minimum wage and working a full week.<\/p> <p>That is the pain people will have to endure this year.<\/p> <p> It will also be a cruel summer for those, with seven or eight weeks to go until kids go back to school, who might not qualify for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, will not get free school books and cannot pull the money together for a short summer break after the very difficult two and a half years that everyone has experienced.  It is important to acknowledge that.  On the day my colleague, Deputy Bacik, was elected leader of the Labour Party, she called for an emergency budget.  That was in April.  We have done so time and again to be constructive.  The crisis is so severe that the Labour Party is prepared to cut short the D&aacute;il recess, to sit as long as it takes, up until August, if the Government Is prepared to work with us to develop and legislate for a comprehensive set of targeted measures to help those most in need to make ends meet.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State will recall, because he was a Deputy at the time, that two budgets in one year were sometimes required when the Fianna F&aacute;il party was last in government.  When public finances collapsed and severe cuts to public spending were to be proposed, the House and the then Government did not stick to the one-budget-a-year convention.  If there is a national fiscal catastrophe, we can have as many budgets in a year as the Government of the day will decide, but when it is a financial crisis for hundreds of thousands of working families across the country, it is a case of business as usual and they will just have to wait until October to see what can be worked out.  That is a tough message to have to sell to people who find themselves having to hand shopping back when they get to the till and realise that they do not have enough money in their purse or wallet to pay for the shopping they put in their basket or trolley.  There is no dignity in that for working people who are struggling.<\/p> <p> We are not calling on the Government to protect everyone from the impact of inflation.  That would be manifestly and objectively impossible.  Nobody is asking the Government to do that.  There are inputs, which have contributed to the rising cost of living, that are way beyond the control of the State.  If the Minister of State is to double down on requests in this House for an emergency budget and to deny the public the opportunity to have those targeted measures in place before the summer recess, I ask that he manage and control his colleagues' utterances in the long run-in to October's budget.  This will be the longest run-in to a budget in living memory.<\/p> <p> The people of Ireland are finding it hard enough to manage without the prospect of enduring pre-budget kites being floated by Government backbenchers and, indeed, Ministers during the summer as they all try to outbid each other in the pre-budget stakes during the silly season.  Every bit of speculation the Government engages in causes more harm and anxiety for hard-pressed householders who are already at the end of their tether.  The biggest offender in terms of public utterances and riffing away on what might or might not be in the budget is the T&aacute;naiste.  He started the silly season early with his annual call - a ritual call - for tax cuts.  As the Minister of State will be aware, tax cuts disproportionately benefit the highest earners.  If the Government is serious about targeted measures to help the people who need it most, it must take tax cuts off the table.  If the Government is serious about using the resources we have in a targeted way, it should use the additional &euro;500 million it intends to use to make primary education genuinely free, for example.  With what is left over from that &euro;500 million, the Government can ensure that GP care is free for more children in an effort to move, inch by inch, towards the ambition of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p> In the Government's determination to drag the budget out to October, it is building up enormous expectations around what it will actually deliver with the big-bang approach it is conditioning us to expect.  Expectations are being built up and the Government is talking up the performance of the economy.  It is a source of great pride for us all that the economy is objectively performing so well.  When it is looked at in the round, it is doing very well but one cannot eat GDP figures.  We were initially told to expect a deficit of more than &euro;1 billion this year but, as was put on the record earlier, we are likely to have a surplus of approximately &euro;1.6 billion.  That is an incredible turnaround and the resources generated through VAT windfalls, perversely on the products that have become the most expensive items these days, such as energy, need to make their way back into the pockets of those who need them most.  We could decide on an administrative basis, without requiring an emergency budget, to use some of the money left over from the Covid contingency fund and channel it to core social welfare rate recipients with what could be known as a summer bonus.  That would be a targeted way to make an intervention and put money into the pockets of those who need it most.  That call we made a number of months ago has essentially been backed up by the ESRI.  In our alternative budget last year, the Labour Party also suggested that we help those who work hard and earn less than &euro;50,000 with a carbon credit that might generate approximately &euro;200 for them to help them make ends meet as well.<\/p> <p> There are a range of different measures we can take even without an emergency budget if the political will was there on an administrative basis to help people between now and October.  We will be watching closely for the Low Pay Commission's report that is, by law, due by the end of the third week of July, to see what it will recommend as an increase to the national minimum wage.  If the Government is to remain between the ditches and meet its target in terms of a living wage, not just a rebranding of the national minimum wage to a living wage, it will need to increase the national minimum wage by at least &euro;1 per hour this year.  I say \"this year\" deliberately because if a recommendation is made to increase the minimum wage, it needs to be introduced immediately after the budget, in the middle of October.  We cannot wait until 1 January as is normally the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800043#SS00700","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656444600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I welcome the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  It is a very important motion to so many people across the country.  Like others, the Social Democrats' position on an emergency budget is very clear.  We need one and we need one now.  However, the Government continues to ignore our calls from this side of the House as well as the many calls from its own benches.  While it is doing that, it is clear that many people in this country are suffering, people on all kinds of different income levels.<\/p>  <p>  Frankly, it seems as though the Government is completely out of touch with reality so here is a little reminder.  Inflation rose to above 8% in May.  One in five people is now living in poverty.  One in three households is now living in energy poverty.  All major energy suppliers have implemented double-digit price hikes.  Petrol is 41% more expensive than last year, and diesel is 45% more expensive.  In Dublin, the average rent is &euro;1,972 per month and the average childcare cost is &euro;1,276 per month.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider what that actually means for families.  Let us consider a family, with two children, that is renting.  What do those figures mean?  How much does someone need to earn in Dublin to be able to pay rent and childcare?  As I said, the average cost of childcare is &euro;1,276 and rent is &euro;1,972.  With two children the cost of childcare is more than &euro;4,500 per month.  The cost per annum of rent and childcare is &euro;54,288.  The average rent and average cost of childcare in Dublin is more than &euro;54,000.  How much does he or she need to earn to have that figure to pay for rent and childcare?  After tax, PRSI and USC, he or she needs &euro;54,000.<\/p> <p>Prior to tax and all those other charges, a single parent would need a gross income of &euro;84,000 to be able to afford that rent and childcare.  A married couple with one income needs gross income of &euro;76,800.  A married couple with two incomes needs gross income of &euro;64,424.  Those are extraordinary figures.  That is before feeding or clothing any of the household, heating the home, putting fuel in the car and paying tax, insurance and so on and before health insurance or pension contributions, much less any luxuries.  These are enormous figures.  Someone has to earn between &euro;64,000 and &euro;84,000 just to pay for the absolute basics of rent and childcare.  Who can do that?  The number of families in a position to do so is very limited.  This is the reality of life in Ireland today and it is completely unsustainable.  Is the Government honestly asking people to wait until October in these circumstances?  How many more people need to drop below the poverty line before the Government will take action?<\/p> <p> It is not just the Social Democrats and other Opposition parties that are calling for immediate interventions; the ESRI agrees too.  In a recent report the ESRI outlined the need for targeted measures.  Through stark analysis, it detailed how those with the least money are most adversely affected by inflation.  That is because lower income households must spend a far greater proportion of their income on energy and food.  The ESRI also warned that tax cuts are not the solution but, instead, targeted measures to protect struggling households, particularly lone parents, senior citizens and those with disabilities.  Similar findings were outlined in the Central Bank's economic letter.  That document presented data showing how rural, low-income and older households are experiencing larger cost-of-living increases.  That type of research should underpin the Government's response.  We need evidence-based decision-making and policymaking, not kite-flying of the stuff that is designed to appeal to certain sectors of the community.<\/p> <p> Targeted measures are needed.  The Social Democrats would start with a &euro;10 increase in core social welfare rates because social welfare rates are falling so far behind inflation.  In the longer term, core social welfare rates such as pensions should be linked to the levels set by the minimum essential standard of living, according to the research that has been done in that regard.  That is a standard of living below which no one should be expected to live.  We should set a goal of moving towards that level over, for example, a three-year period.  Additionally, an easily accessible hardship fund for people falling into fuel and food poverty must be established as a matter of urgency.  The tone-deaf advice that struggling households should just contact their community welfare officers shows the Government's lack of understanding as to who can seek assistance from social welfare officers.  That is why a new hardship fund with specific and well-communicated criteria is so urgently needed to assist people through this awful crisis.  For hard-pressed parents facing up to &euro;1,500 in back-to-school costs for each child, budget measures in October will simply be too late.  That assistance is required now.  Last year a survey by the Irish League of Credit Unions revealed that 24% of parents go into debt when trying to pay back-to-school costs.  The Government should immediately return the back-to-school allowance to its levels in 2010, when it was paid at rates of &euro;200 per child under 12 and &euro;305 per child over 12.  In addition, the review of the school meals programme should be fast-tracked to ensure that any expansion of the programme can be done in advance of the new school year.<\/p> <p> As for education, primary and secondary school must be made genuinely free.  A hundred years after the foundation of the State, schools are still fundraising and parents are still scraping together money to pay for the gap between the cost of running a school and the cost of the capitation.  That is for the most basic services - cleaning, insurance, overheads, electricity and keeping the place warm.  Currently, the average back-to-school cost at primary level is &euro;1,200 and, for secondary education, &euro;1,500.  That is by no means free education.  To deliver free primary and secondary education, there must be no additional or hidden charges such as voluntary contributions, school books or uniforms because those disadvantage children hugely and go against the whole principle of levelling the playing pitch for young children.  Doing this would cost a total of &euro;238 million, just 2.5% of the overall education budget.  Surely we can afford that.<\/p> <p> Another area which needs urgent attention is disability supports.  Given that disability-related welfare payments have not kept pace with growth in market income, in conjunction with the markedly higher cost of living with a disability, the standard of living among this group has fallen way below that of an ordinary worker.  For that reason, it is absolutely essential we introduce a cost-of-disability payment.<\/p> <p> These are just some of the measures the Government should be implementing now and in October.  People are suffering.  This is an emergency and it must be treated as such.  People simply cannot wait.  The Government cannot delay the kinds of supports people so desperately need just to survive.

We urgently need an emergency budget to address a crisis that is absolutely crushing hundreds of thousands of people in this country.  Working people, pensioners, students and people on low and middle incomes are being absolutely crucified.  The Government is being very dishonest in its responses to the cost-of-living and housing crises.  We should always refer to those twin crises because they are both absolutely disastrous in their proportions and in the impact they are having on ordinary people.  The Government is being completely dishonest in suggesting that the major reason for this cost-of-living crisis is the war in Ukraine.  We all, of course, abhor Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  It is a brutal, unjustifiable invasion and is impacting grain exports out of Ukraine and energy prices.  However, the idea that the specific characteristics of the cost-of-living and housing crises in this country, which are worse than anywhere else in Europe and were before the war in Ukraine started, are somehow the fault of that war is just dishonest.  It is the Government desperately trying to deflect.  We had 35 energy price hikes in 2021, before the war started.  In 2020, even before the cost-of-living crisis really took off, Ireland had the highest price levels in the EU, 40% higher than the EU average.  The ICTU estimated in the document it produced recently on the social wage that utility costs and housing costs in this country are 78% higher than the EU average.  We have the highest childcare costs in Europe.  We are far worse affected by the housing and rental crisis than anywhere else in Europe because of the failure of the Government to control the cost of accommodation, childcare and so on and to provide them as public services and rights to our citizens and because we have essentially let the market dictate all those things.<\/p> <p>There is a connection between neoliberalism, privatisation and the fact that we have more or less the worst cost-of-living and housing crises in Europe.  The more you allow the market to dictate, the worse these crises hit you.<br\/><br\/>Why do we have just about the worst housing crisis in Europe and the biggest hikes in the cost of accommodation and rents?  It is because only 9% of the housing stock in this country is social housing.  The figure is 25% in Austria and in most of Europe, it is around 20%.  When markets dictate rents and house prices go through the roof.  Why do we have the highest childcare costs in Europe?  It is because almost all of our childcare has been privatised.  Why do we have the highest energy costs in Europe when we used to have the lowest?  It is because we privatised and deregulated energy.  The greedy profiteers control some of the key areas where the cost of living is crushing and crippling people.  For the Government to hide behind the war in Ukraine is utterly dishonest.<br\/><br\/>In my last few minutes of speaking time, I will focus on human suffering that is coming from this and on the lack of urgency on the part of the Government.  I will read out this message I received the other day from a young woman.  She has now been in emergency accommodation with her young son for three and a half years.  Again and again, I ask about her plight.  Her message said: <\/p><blockquote>\tI watched your video from yesterday.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem they are going to do anything.  Leo mentioned the budget.  Sure that&rsquo;s not until October.  It is awful.  I have never hated living somewhere so much as I do living here.  It is honestly taking its toll on both of our mental health.  There seems to be no way out of this nightmare.  So unfair of my son sharing a bunk bed with me in a tiny space.  I am actually starting to give up hope. <\/blockquote> <p>The woman who, by the way, works as an agency worker looking after vulnerable children for a State agency, contacted me again the next day.  This is how she has to live with her son.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI am sick again out of work for the third time since March.  The stress of it all is too much, to be honest.  My son is off for the summer and he doesn&rsquo;t want to come home here.  He wants to stay with my parents.  I don&rsquo;t blame him but it is now separating us as a family.  It is just awful.  It feels like a trap with no way out now. <\/blockquote> <p>If that does not get across to the Government the urgency of this, I do not know what will.  October is no good to her.  She has been three and a half years in emergency accommodation and, just recently, was taken off the housing list because her income crept slightly over the income threshold.  For five years now, successive Governments have said they would raise the income thresholds.  We were promised that the Government would review those income thresholds before the summer recess.  That is now gone.  As Leo said the other day, it will be October now.  That woman and many others are banjaxed.  Why does the Government not want to review those limits?  It is because it will have to extend the housing assistance payment, HAP, income support to many more people and it does not want to do that, so we will wait until the October budget.  That is causing real suffering.<br\/><br\/>Today, as I am speaking again, a family with two working parents and two children aged nine and 14 years of age were made homeless because their landlord is evicting them for reasons of sale from where they are living.  They have nowhere to go.  There is no emergency accommodation available for the parents or their children.  I have ten or 12 cases of people being evicted into homelessness in my office at the moment.  The Government will not stop evictions, control rents or provide emergency accommodation for people.  These things cannot wait.  Real human beings are suffering grotesquely now from all of these things and something has to be done now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800045#UU00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656445800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>The Minister is effectively saying to struggling families that there will be nothing extra done for them next month or the month after that when they are preparing for children going back to school, and nor will anything be done for them in September.

The lack of urgency shown by the Minister and the Government will not be forgotten by the people.<\/p>  <p>  Workers on low pay are among those being hit hardest in this crisis.  I will talk about one group of workers who have not received a pay increase now for 14 years.  I am referring to the personal assistants at the Irish Wheelchair Association.  These people do very valuable work.  They help people to shower and use the toilet and bring them to the shops.  This Government refuses to engage seriously with them or their trade union representatives, which has forced them to plan to strike next Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the Government intends to increase the pay of judges, doctors, high-flyers and people earning more than &euro;150,000 a year by 10%, 15% and, in some cases, &euro;20,000 a year this Friday.

I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800046#VV00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1656445800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach and welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  The Opposition will put forward its case for an emergency budget.  The Government will respond when it has the opportunity to do so.  The Opposition will put forward its case for an emergency budget.  The Government will respond that there is no need for one and that it will address these issues in October.  The reality is that there are practical steps that can be taken today which would make a real difference to families who are struggling.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and I sat down around the table when we were negotiating Project Ireland 2040.  At that time, we set a target of retrofitting 45,000 homes from 2021 onwards.  As the Minister knows, that target was watered down this year to just 22,000 homes, of which 4,500 house people on social welfare.  We will be very lucky if the very first of those grants announced to such fanfare earlier in the year is paid by the end of September when the fuel allowance kicks in.<\/p>  <p>  We can increase the fuel allowance and social welfare rates but the one long-term measure that can address the challenges our people face in respect of energy bills and the cost of heating their homes is to reduce the cost of heating homes.  The practical way to do that is through retrofitting.  That programme of retrofitting should have been ramped up at this stage.  Covid-19 is not he reason it has not been ramped up.  There is now a need to prioritise retrofitting homes.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the other issues that people are facing is the spiralling cost of accommodation, that is, if they are lucky enough to be able to secure a property to rent.  This has been a very serious issue in our cities for a long period.  In the past five days, I have had three professionals come to my constituency office looking for accommodation to rent in Roscommon town.  It cannot be got at any price.  These are three professionals working in the town.<\/p> <p>They cannot source accommodation in the town or its hinterland.  What is absolutely criminal is that, according to the data the CSO announced in recent days, we have 4,000 vacant homes in County Roscommon.  We have more than 100,000 vacant houses throughout the country in the middle of a housing emergency.<\/p> <p> Something that could help to reduce the cost of housing and provide accommodation for people would be to release these homes.  One way that could help do this is to alter the conditions of the repair and lease scheme of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This is the scheme whereby a local authority can take over private accommodation from a landlord, carry out the repairs that need to be made to the house and lease it out for five years.  To acquire these properties, the local authority must show a housing need in the community.  The difficulty, as the Minister knows well, is that there has not been a tradition of local authority housing in areas such as the small villages we have in County Roscommon.  People do not express a preference to reside there.  In fact, the villages are not even listed on the council's housing application form.  Even though there is vacant housing and there is a huge demand for housing, these houses cannot come under the repair and lease scheme.  A small alteration to the terms and conditions of the scheme regarding the housing needs test would help to release some of the properties.<\/p> <p> I have no doubt there are people on the social housing list who would take that accommodation.  If they are not willing to take it, I can tell the Minister there are many other people, such as the three professionals I spoke to and many people in this city, who would relocate to rural Ireland if they had the opportunity of a fixed rent over a five-year period.  The local authorities would not be stuck with these properties.  We need a bit of initiative to try to release some of them into the housing market where they are urgently needed.<\/p> <p> I want to speak about a number of pointless charges in the system that need to be removed.  The first is the public service obligation levy on electricity customers.  Every month through the PSO the State collects &euro;4.88 from every electricity customer without any need for the money at present.  In fact, the State is taking in the money at present and plans to give it back to people next October.  Surely it would make far more sense to suspend the collection of the PSO today and give people some relief rather than gathering the money and bringing forward legislation to try to give back some of it later in the year.  Give people a break today.<\/p> <p> While I am on the issue of legislation, with regard to the Bill that will come before the House tomorrow, the Minister will pony up the capital cost up-front to allow EirGrid to buy the generating capacity for 450 MW of electricity.  However, ultimately it will be every electricity customer in the country who will pay for it.  The Minister and I know from the engagement we have had previously that much of the 450 MW of electricity we have to acquire is because of the huge demand placed on our electricity network by data centres.  I have told the Minister in the past that I believe it is immoral that electricity customers and families struggling to pay electricity bills should be subsidising the cost of green electricity going into data centres and subsidising the cost of transporting electricity from the west coast of Ireland to the data centres in Dublin.  These companies should pay the costs themselves instead of passing them back to families who are struggling to pay their electricity bills.  I urge the Minister to deal with this issue today.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister and I will disagree on the next pointless charge I will discuss, which is the carbon tax.  At present it costs motorists approximately 13 cent a litre when VAT is included.  This has a disproportionate impact on families living in rural areas and communities who do not have the availability of public transport and cannot get the 20% relief the Government is providing on public transport in urban areas.  As I have said to the Minister previously, we need a form of carbon tax that is fluid so that when the price of oil goes up, the carbon tax take comes down, and when the price of oil comes down, the carbon tax take goes up so that we have a consistent incremental increase in the price of fossil fuels and oil between now and 2030 rather than this see-saw approach that will do nothing to motivate people to move in the long term to more sustainable options.<\/p> <p> The Minister will come back and argue with me that the money is needed to carry out the retrofitting I have spoken about.  We are now getting in substantially more money in VAT from fossil fuels, petrol, diesel and home heating fuels than we had projected in the budget last year.  This money could be used to cross-subsidise the reduction in carbon tax take if there was relief on it.  The one thing an alteration in carbon tax would do tomorrow morning is that it would disproportionately benefit families in rural areas.  The Minister knows what the ESRI has said, which is that families in rural communities are being disproportionately impacted by the increase in the cost of fuels and the increases throughout the economy that we are all experiencing at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800046#VV00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656446400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Rural Independent Group fully supports the motion.  We were the first political grouping in the D&aacute;il to call on the Government to hold an emergency mini budget, when we moved a Private Members' motion on 23 February 2022.  We also moved a Private Members' motion in April calling on the Government to axe the carbon tax, which would have had the impact of putting about &euro;8,000 directly in every person's pocket between now and 2030.  Last month we called on the Minister for Finance to reduce to zero all fuel and energy taxes until the end of 2022.  Perhaps the worst aspect of the Government&rsquo;s crippling carbon tax, which it hiked again on 1 May, is that it was specifically designed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party the last time they shared power together to make petrol, diesel, and all available energy products much more expensive.  We are seeing the biting impacts of this now.<\/p>  <p>  The Government voted down our proposal in February, despite the fact the motion called on the Government to recognise the cost-of-living crisis as a national emergency.

We sought the introduction of a comprehensive and robust package of measures intended to support those less well-off and impacted sectors through allocating financial aid and slashing energy consumption taxes.  The Government does not have a monopoly on good ideas and its members must urgently remove their heads from the sand dunes and re-enter the real world.

It is the same with the farmers.  They are in a desperate situation.  Farm contractors are speaking about &euro;1 more for a litre of green diesel than what they paid last year.  They are in a desperate situation and the Government will have to do something.  If it does not, it will cripple the country and grind it to a halt.

Whatever about the budget, and you can put whatever name you like on it, I am calling on the Minister to help these people.  The Government is taking in way more tax now than it was at the time of the budget last year, when fuel was around &euro;1.20 per litre for diesel or petrol.  It is nearly double that now, so the Government has nearly doubled the tax take.  I ask the Government to give it back to the people on the road who are suffering.  In a way, the Government will ensure costs for everything else are kept down rather than rising.  People just cannot keep going.  The wheels will grind to a halt.  Whether it is the lorry and tractor men, men and women going to work or mothers taking their children to school, and we do not have school transport in every part of our rural areas, they are all suffering and they are the most entitled to get the money back.  They are the people who are paying the extra tax and suffering the most.  They are people with a wheel, whatever type of a vehicle it is, and they are suffering.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister and his Government to give attention to those people today, not in October.  Many of them will be gone under come October.  That is the truth.  The Minister has heard Deputy Michael Collins speak about the fishermen.  It is the very same with lorry and tractor men and the people trying to continue to go to work.  Those are the people who are suffering.  The Government has extra tax and wriggle room.

We had the exact same motion before the House last February calling on the Minister to address the ever-increasing cost of living.  That was back in February, a number of months ago, when fuel was not even at the awfully high price it is now, which is having the knock-on effect of raising the cost of everything.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the difference it will make to people who are struggling, the Minister keeps saying people will have to wait until October, but I appeal to the Minister in this regard because people really do not have the luxury of waiting until then.  Farmers, fishermen, young couples and everybody else who is vulnerable are facing such a massive shock increase.  It is all interconnected.  People are complaining about ESB bills, that they are getting the shock of their lives when the bill comes into the house.  The Minister comes along to say there will be &euro;200 off the price of electricity.  That &euro;200 was like the money that was reduced on petrol and diesel.  I will never forget - I think it was a Wednesday night - when the Minister reduced the price in the House, but he neglected to tell people that it went up by more on the Monday and Tuesday nights than he brought it down by on the Wednesday night.  It was as though the Minister had spit in the ocean, to be blunt about it.<\/p>  <p>  The tax take the Minister is getting out of petrol and diesel at present is frightening.

Why does it take so long for the Government to realise people have already started to cut back considerably and cannot afford to live?  We are being driven into recession.

They were saying to me that, when it comes to education, their parents always gave them an allowance because they had no transport and helped them drive to school for the extra grinds they needed, but they cannot afford to do that now.  They were asking why the Government is not protecting them.  That was their question.  Why is the Government not listening to the Independents?  They were saying the Government does not see them anymore.  A party and a Government that was supposed to represent the country does not see them anymore.

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for the opportunity to debate this issue again.  The issue is one of the most serious facing the people of this country and it is of its time.  I find the position of the Government on the cost-of-living crisis quite incredible.  People are struggling now.  They are struggling to put food on the table, pay their rent or mortgage, run a car or pay an energy bill.  They were struggling last week, they are struggling this week and they will struggle next week.  In August, they will be worrying about the cost of sending their children back to school in September.  They cannot wait for the October budget, which is almost four months away.<\/p>  <p>  It is quite incredible, not to say outrageous, that the Government has dug its heels in and is refusing even to consider immediate measures to help alleviate the crisis at this time.  Even some of the Government backbenchers are calling for them.  I heard Deputy O'Dea on the radio at the weekend.  Senator Doherty and others in the Fine Gael Party are also reflecting the pressure people are under.<\/p>  <p>  I have to ask what the problem is with an emergency budget.  We are not in a crisis with the State's finances, as noted in the motion.  The Government is set to take in an extra &euro;5.6 billion this year over what was expected in the budget last October.  The Government can afford to act and act now.<\/p>  <p>  As also noted in the motion, there are factors in this crisis beyond the control of the Government and not everyone can be protected, but there are measures which can be targeted at those most in need, and these need to be taken now.  For example, the &euro;5 increase in basic welfare payments and State pensions in the previous budget, following two previous budgets without an increase, was completely inadequate.  Those dependent on these payments are now experiencing a 10% increase in their cost of living.  A 10% increase in an emergency budget is now needed.  Yes, it is &euro;25 to &euro;30 per week, but that is what is needed, and it is needed now rather than in October or later.<\/p>  <p>  There are now just under 1 million people living below the poverty line.<\/p> <p>There are 29% of people in fuel poverty.  A major factor in this has been rent, which increased by 12% last year.  Rent caps are not working and we need an immediate rent freeze.  The best way to do this is through an emergency budget.<\/p> <p> The cost of putting petrol or diesel into a car is now a major problem for many people, particularly those in rural areas with limited or zero public transport options and those who must drive as part of their work, including home carers.  In June 2021, a litre of petrol was &euro;1.49 but it is now more than &euro;2.  Diesel was &euro;1.39 per litre and it is now more than &euro;2.  The Government has said it cannot cut the VAT rate of 23% but it can cut excise duty and carbon taxes, which in my understanding comprise up to 50% of the cost of fuel at the pump.  Last year, in excess of &euro;2 billion was collected by the State in excise and tax on fuels and the cuts introduced in March have been completely overtaken by fuel price rises.  The cuts are also due to expire in September, so more action is needed, again through an emergency budget.<\/p> <p> Another matter that requires immediate action is the question of an emergency cost of living hardship fund.  A sum of &euro;45.7 million provided by the Government for exceptional and urgent needs schemes in 2022.  This seems to be an inadequate sum.  I have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Social Protection asking the number of people who have made applications from last May to April this year.  I received some figures for Intreo offices on Cork Street and Bishop's Square in Dublin and the Minister also indicates that the Department is compiling more extensive statistics.  This is an urgent task, along with getting information from non-governmental organisations on the number of people using food banks, in order to assess the level of need out there.  We must respond with an emergency fund to properly meet that need.  It must be a specific cost-of-living emergency fund.<\/p> <p> Radio advertisements have been run by the Department in the past few weeks dealing with a point I raised a number of months ago and letting people know what services are available and how to access them, which I welcome.  I also believe community welfare officers should be relocated back to the community to make the service more accessible to those who need it.<\/p> <p> I will speak to the question of a living wage.  There are high levels of low pay and the problem affects one in every four or five workers.  It is a key component of the huge and unacceptable levels of poverty in our society.  The living wage legislation being drawn up by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment seems to estimate a living wage at 60% of the median wage.  I have worked that out to be approximately &euro;11 per hour, and it is to be introduced over four to five years.  A wage of &euro;11 per hour is not a living wage and it is hardly an improvement on the minimum wage, which itself is a poverty wage that has become the norm in certain sectors of the economy.  A living wage in a city like Dublin is &euro;15 per hour.  The cost of living coalition of which I am a part will continue to organise protests and demonstrations to achieve that, along with other key demands, including an emergency budget now, when people need it.<\/p> <p> I will make a final point about the crisis affecting people who face eviction and termination notices.  We had a young family in the office the other day.  We contacted the family unit of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and we were advised it is at capacity, with no vacancies in hubs.  People are now facing terror when they receive an eviction notice from landlords.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800048#XX00400","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656447600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity provided by Sinn F&eacute;in to discuss the rise in the cost of living and I thank the party for that.

That is not sustainable because of the rising cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  It would be attractive to think a mini-budget or emergency budget on its own would solve this.  I accept that throwing money at the problem through social welfare payments alone is not going to solve this.  It will do it for certain cohorts and particularly for people with no other source of income, it would have to be part of the solution.  There would certainly have to be large tax credits along the lines of those in the UK for childcare and that must be part of the solution.  It will have to be part of the solution very quickly.<\/p>  <p>  We must try to stop the cost of living rising further.  This is difficult because for decades we have heard that we are the most globalised economy in the world.  We have very few tools at our disposal and it is a very difficult time but we must consider what has been successful up to now.  In Ireland, inflation is now running at increasingly unsustainable levels, driven by energy and housing costs.  France managed to stem inflation a little by capping the cost of energy.  That was facilitated by the fact France did not follow the folly of Germany in closing its nuclear power stations before it had an alternative fuel supply.  We do not have one either, although, like France, we have an energy sector that is largely State-owned.  The Minister is going to have to look at capping energy costs in Ireland to put a cap on the rising cost of living.  We must also look at ways in which rising interest rate costs can be prevented from being passed to tenants who are renting.  That is even without even discussing food inflation, which to date has not been a major contributor in Ireland, unlike in other European countries.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly asked the Government to put measures in place to try to combat or lower input costs.  If that is not done, they must be passed on by farmers, unless they go broke themselves.  If that happens, we will have food shortages.  Those input costs must be passed on.  To date, no measures to combat those have been put in place.  If we do not have an emergency budget, I ask the Government to put plans in place now to try to stall the inevitable increase in the cost of fuel, energy, housing and food next year.  Unless measures are put in place now to stop that, it will be inadequate to throw money at the problem next October and it will not help people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800049#YY00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1656447600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions on a matter I know is very important for our country.  It is a challenge affecting homes and households in every community in our country this evening.  It is in recognition of this that the Government has acted.  It is in understanding the challenges many are facing that we have made so many changes already.  I want to list what they are because it is very important to remind the House of the scale of the measures that have been implemented.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the measures brought forward on budget day, including tax and social welfare changes worth just under &euro;1 billion, the Government reduced the excise duty on petrol and diesel and reduced the VAT on gas and electricity.  We brought in a &euro;200 additional payment via an electricity credit.  For those we know are affected by rising costs in fuel, we have brought in two additional payments of more than &euro;200, which will help those at risk of fuel poverty.  Since the D&aacute;il passed its budget last October and the additional challenges have become more acute and intense for so many, the Government has brought forward measures worth &euro;1.4 billion, which we implemented quickly to help those dealing with the rising costs of living as rapidly as we can.<\/p>  <p>  We absolutely understand that for families and households, the rising cost of energy, food and other services is having a real impact on their purses and wallets.  That is why since our latest budget, we have introduced additional measures that are equivalent to an entire budget again of new measures.<\/p> <p>They have been put in place because we recognise the challenge that we are facing, right after having had to deal with the economic, social and health consequences of a pandemic.  I experience in my own constituency and see in people I meet within my own community the very strain that many Opposition Deputies have referred to.  It is in recognition of that that we have put so many additional measures in place.  <\/p> <p> I want to deal with some of the points that were raised by Opposition Deputies regarding the ESRI and IFAC and where we are with our tax revenue at the moment and the fact that for some taxes we are collecting ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in the year.  To deal with the references that have been made to what the ESRI and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have said, it is correct that those organisations have made the case for additional interventions to help our country deal with the cost of living.  They have acknowledged some flexibility that is there to do it.  However, in the same report the ESRI also said that in light of the pressures in terms of the challenges outside our economy at the moment, it is evident that fiscal policy will have to be particularly prudent over the coming years.  I did not hear much reference to that in the debate.  The institute also made the point that given the challenges our economy and State could face in the time ahead, it may be prudent to deploy a portion of the receipts we could gain in the future from corporate tax and other forms of tax collection towards long-term investment activities or other forms of savings.  IFAC said that the risks around the path for the public finances are unusually wide, and that the space for funding new initiatives on a sustainable basis is very limited.  The report of the research organisation, IFAC, which was cited earlier, did acknowledge the space for interventions to help with the cost of living, but also acknowledged that the risks and challenges we are facing make the case for a careful approach with regard to our public finances in the time ahead.<\/p> <p> The point has been made about where we are on tax receipts.  To argue on the one hand that people will spend less and then, on the other, say that our public finances will remain healthy indefinitely is inconsistent.  Many are arguing, with good cause, that rising costs are affecting the standard of living and people are, therefore, spending less.  That is a change that, were it to happen over many weeks, months or even years in the time ahead, would of course have an effect on where our public finances are.  We cannot on the one hand say we expect and acknowledge that people are spending less due to a rising cost of living and, on the other, say our public finances are in good condition, we can expect them to be in good condition for the time ahead and we should do more emergency budgets.  The two things are inconsistent.  That is why the Government is so aware that if we are going to intervene, we have to get the balance right between intervening to help today and not creating new problems and risks tomorrow, including potentially adding to the inflationary pressures we are facing at the moment or even creating new risks and challenges in our public finances such that we would have to undo tomorrow measures we would bring in today.  Our country went down that path before.  It is not so long ago that people were asking me how we were going to pay for all the additional debt we incurred during the era of Covid.  It is not so long since we were having a debate in this House regarding the need to spend more due to Covid, which did result in an additional &euro;32 billion worth of debt.  That debt is there.  It is a factor in decisions that we have made.<\/p> <p> I accept the Deputy's point about the impact inflation will have on our debt dynamics.  I think that is the point he would have gone on to make.  It is also the reason the interest rate on new borrowing is going up.  That is the other side of the coin if we are in an environment in which the interest rate for borrowing is going to go up in the future.  It has gone up from just above zero on 1 January to just under 2.5% this evening.  That is a change that has happened.  That is also a factor that I and the Government have to take into account in the decisions we make.  It is about the need for this balance.<\/p> <p> This balance is not present in what the Opposition is putting forward this evening.  If I had brought in an emergency budget this morning, I have no doubt that by tonight the Opposition would be condemning it for not being enough.  If I was to come into this House tomorrow morning with the emergency budget the Opposition is looking for, by lunchtime it would be saying the Government needed to do more.  It would be claiming it was not enough and saying we needed another emergency budget the following week.  That may work as an Opposition tactic but it does not work with the risks and challenges our country may have to confront in the time ahead, and acknowledging that we have come through a pandemic and got our country back to a level of employment that would have looked so unlikely even a year ago and public finances that are recovering.  During the pandemic we tried to make decisions that would get the balance right between acknowledging the need to intervene now but also acknowledging that there would be other issues and needs we would need to respond to tomorrow.  We got that balance right during the pandemic.  We are now in a changed time and in very different circumstances with new risks, opportunities and issues around our country.  We have to take that into account in decisions we are making.<\/p> <p> Yes, we know the challenge that many are facing.  We know the rising anxiety and worry.  It is why the Government is not talking about intervening in 2022.  It is why we have already intervened so many times in 2022.  When we come to our budget for 2023, it will contain additional measures for this year to help in a winter that we expect and know will be difficult for so many.  We have to get the balance right between intervening to help today and doing our best to avoid further risks and challenges tomorrow.  Even if they are not that big of a concern for the Opposition this evening, they are something the country will be concerned about and something the Government has a duty to manage and respond to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800049#YY00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656448200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The cost-of-living crisis has been felt most keenly by those on low to middle incomes.  That is no surprise to anybody.  A greater proportion of their earnings is devoted to the purchase of food, payment of rent and heating of their homes.  In Limerick, we have seen rents spiral out of control and beyond the means of many.  We need a ban on rent increases and we need the Government to put money back into renters' pockets through a refundable tax credit worth a month's rent.  There is no emergency accommodation available in Limerick if someone unfortunately becomes homeless.  The cost of renting a two-bed unit in Limerick has increased by 13.2% since the last quarter of 2020.  There are often 100 people a day lingering on hospital trolleys in Limerick.  The cost of living has put immense pressure on families, particularly those with children.  I was told by a constituent recently that they no longer feel they are living but merely surviving.  One must wonder how they will cope when the winter nights fall quickly, the cold sets in and they need to heat their homes.  Those who are faced with stresses cannot wait for next year for any relief.  The recent ESRI report on energy poverty and deprivation, to which the Minister referred, shows that one in three households in the country is in energy poverty.  There must be a removal of excise on home heating oil.  In Limerick, for instance, the average cost of 500 l is &euro;769, an astronomical amount for any family to pay.  We need an emergency budget to alleviate some of these pressures.<\/p>  <p>  Factors outside the control of the Government have exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis, nobody doubts that, but there remains scope for the Government to do much more to protect citizens.  The crisis is only going to get worse.  Waiting until January is something many families simply cannot afford to do.  The Government needs to wake up and realise the realities of this.<\/p> <p>People are suffering now.  There is scope for the introduction of an emergency budget.  It is projected that the State will take in more tax revenue than we had expected on budget day.  Much of this surplus must be used to support those suffering most in the crisis.  Any such budget must, as a priority, increase working age social welfare rates.  Inflation has spiralled to its highest level in four years and such a measure is vital to protect the most vulnerable members of our society.  There is a need to introduce both temporary and permanent measures in such a budget.  We need to assist families.  One of the most important things we can do in this regard is immediately reduce childcare costs.  Childcare costs are an albatross around the neck of working families and equivalent to a second mortgage for many of them.  We need to provide more help with back-to-school costs in advance of the new term in September.  The temporary measures will cost &euro;175 million.  <\/p> <p> We are increasingly seeing workers returning to social welfare payments, such as the working family payment, to top up their weekly income.  Sinn F&eacute;in would establish a living wage to prevent workers from being placed on poverty wages.  We also want to see the Low Pay Commission transformed into a living wage commission to ensure the living wage is adequate to support workers with the cost of living.  <\/p> <p> I am calling for all Deputies to support this motion.  Unless they bury their heads in the sand, they cannot but have seen the effects the cost-of-living crisis is having on our constituents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800050#ZZ00200","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656448800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>The Minister referenced the rising costs and the way that they are affecting the standard of living, genuinely making it sound like people might have to trim a few luxuries off of their shopping bill but, in truth, people are making hard and horrible choices already.<\/p><p>I promised a constituent of mine that I would raise a message that she sent to me with the Minister.  A mother on the disability allowance said that if anything breaks in her house, it stays broken.  She said not to mention help from the community welfare officer, CWO.  She continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe only bill I have that is any way flexible is the food bill and I have already cut back on that.  I can't cut anymore. <\/blockquote>  <p>She cannot wait until October.  The charge levelled at the Minister&rsquo;s Government that it is out of touch and does not get it.  In my own constituency, the Government representatives are largely invisible.  The reason for that is they hide from their constituents because they are ashamed.  They know that the Government could intervene but it has set his face against it, saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;.<\/p><p>I do not know if the Minister has ever had the experience or understands what it is like to have to say, &quot;No&quot; to a child because he cannot afford something; it is horrible.  I was out canvassing the other night and I met a family who had put a deposit down on a small holiday a couple of years ago.  With Covid and everything else, they could not take the holiday.  They had some savings, but the cost of living has forced them to eat into their savings.  The mother said to me that they had a holiday organised but they cannot afford to pay the balance.  She pulled the door in behind her, she looked me in the eye and she said, &quot;Jesus, we have not even told the kids yet.&quot;  I do not know if the Minister knows what it is like to never have anything to look forward to.  That is what people are experiencing now.  Their savings are gone, if they had any.  They are not getting wage increases to keep pace with inflation. <\/p><p>In March 2021, the T&aacute;naiste pledged a living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour.  Two weeks ago, he pledged a living wage of &euro;12.17 per hour and no explanation as to where the other 13 cent had gone.  Certainly, the Minister and I both know that you cannot pay for your shopping with pledges.  People need action now; they are desperate now.  That is why we are calling for all Deputies, in particular those backbenchers who are very fond of taking to the airwaves to say that the Government should do more.

Deputy Farrell mentioned the person who goes to bed early because they cannot afford to heat their home.  There were many other stories like that.  That is what is happening in the real world when we get out of these kind of cosy environments and talk to people on the streets, in their homes and in their villages.  They are telling us that they are struggling to get by.  Why would they not?  We are seeing inflation at rates that we have not seen in nearly 40 years.  The message from Government is:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBuckle up folks. You are on your own because we do not know what we are going to do for at least another four months. <\/blockquote>  <p>It is very scary that we have a Government in charge of this State that is so out of touch with the needs of ordinary people the length and breadth of this State.  It does not understand the anxiety, pressure, worries and financial and mental health issues that are bearing down on these families because of this crisis and the rise of energy prices and the prices of petrol, food and clothing and all of the anxiety that comes with that.

That is a disgraceful attitude from a Government that is completely out of touch.<\/p><p>It is not just Sinn F&eacute;in that has been arguing that there needs to be further interventions.  The Minister acknowledged this.  The ESRI said that more needs to be done.  It said there has to be prudence because it needs to be targeted, which the Government is not doing.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the watchdog that was set up to make sure that we do not have the boom and bust that were brought to us by Fianna F&aacute;il when wrecking the economy more than a decade ago, said there is scope for further targeted interventions to help people offset the cost-of-living crisis.  The Central Bank said the same.  Yet, the Minister for Finance, despite the fact that inflation has resulted in a bonanza in State revenue, will not act any further; indeed, he makes a virtue of it.  We heard the Minister of State, whose answer previously to the inflation crisis was that people should shop around.  He said in his speech that the Government&rsquo;s measures were targeted.  Let us put that to the test.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has an entire table in the report, table 3.1, which is called &ldquo;Cost-of-living measures not targeted&rdquo; by the Government.  It said that of the &euro;1 billion of measures introduced this year ahead of the stability programme update, SPU, &euro;896 million of it was not targeted, which is nearly 90%.  The ESRI said there is fiscal space to assist those most affected, but it must be targeted.  The OECD said that such measures introduced by the Government have provided only limited protection to poor households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800051#AAA00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1656448800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>But the Deputy wants me to cut taxes even more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800051#AAA00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1656448800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Yet, the Minister still does not get it.

Unfortunately, people the length and breadth of this State, including the one in the three people who are in energy poverty, the one in three, according to the Bank of Ireland survey, who are finding it difficult to make ends meet or the people who are now going in droves to avail of food parcels, cannot wait.

Yes, there is a lot going on, but it is all funnelling work in the same direction, which is to change culture in the Defence Forces and to make them a safer and more attractive place to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800052#BBB00800","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","time":1656449400,"counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800052#BBB00850"},{"type":"question","time":1656449400,"counter":401,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[33771\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800052#BBB00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will outline the pay improvement measures recommended by the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces; the expected timeline for the implementation of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1587","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1656449400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>As we are aware, approximately five months ago, the Commission on the Defence Forces report was published.

The report makes a number of recommendations in this regard, including on pay structures, pay review, pay bargaining and ICTU.  These recommendations are significant and require detailed consideration.  In regard to the ICTU recommendation, the Deputy will be aware that I recently provided my consent for the temporary associate membership of ICTU for the purpose of engagement in national pay negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting also that the commission observed that much of the commentary surrounding issues of pay in the Defence Forces does not seem to fully reflect the totality of the remuneration package and it believes that this needs to be better communicated.  A recently developed infographic on the benefits of a career in the Defence Forces aims to address this.  It sets out, for example, that a graduate cadet, on commissioning, will receive &euro;43,630 per annum; a school leaver cadet, on commissioning, will receive &euro;38,601 per annum; and a recruit, on completion of 26 weeks training, will receive &euro;30,152 per annum.  I have detailed rates of pay across all ranks, which I will happily provide to the Deputy, although I suspect, given his background, he is more than familiar with those rates.<\/p> <p>Clearly any implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations requires careful\u00a0consideration and\u00a0in some critical aspects an interdepartmental discussion.  Since its publication, I have engaged in extensive consultation with my ministerial colleagues and with a range of other stakeholders, including representative associations.  I will shortly revert to the Government with a proposed response to the commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan. \u00a0This is a complex process dependent on securing Cabinet agreement on the recommendations.  The implementation process will, and can only, follow that.<\/p> <p> In terms of pay more generally the Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces where issues arise and in the context of national pay agreements.  The current public service pay agreement provides for increases in pay and allowances to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, and the Deputy is aware that negotiations have been ongoing on an extension to this agreement.

To me, a panel of international experts recommending specific pay improvements should at least hold equivalence.  It gives the Minister a small level of leverage from a negotiation point of view with his Cabinet colleagues.  There is legislation which would give the Minister significant leverage, in that these recommendations in the commission&rsquo;s report really only bring many of the troops up to the national minimum wage of &euro;10.50 an hour.  The Minister&rsquo;s Cabinet colleagues may not be aware that the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 applies to the Defence Forces but is currently not being applied.

The Government, however, has committed to amending this Act and bringing both the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the scope of its provisions where appropriate.  The EU working time directive recognises the specific nature of certain military activities and allows for derogations or exemptions of such activities.  Extensive work undertaken by civil and military management has determined that a high percentage of the normal everyday work of the Defence Forces is already in compliance with the EU working time directive.  However, it has also been determined that there are some activities which may qualify for an exemption due to the very specific nature.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that ongoing deliberations between civil and military management on the wider implementation of the EU working time directive within the Defence Forces are at an advanced stage.  In fact, they are nearing conclusion.

I am assured that the outcome of these deliberations, including with regard to possible exemptions for certain activities, will be fully aligned with the provisions of the EU working time directive and case law on these matters.  Furthermore consultation with the representative associations on the outcome of the deliberations by civil and military management on the wider implementation of the EU working time directive will be undertaken through the mechanism of the working time directive conciliation and arbitration subcommittee in the very near future.

Transition year students can avail of placements within the Defence Forces to undertake various programmes demonstrating career opportunities.  This also serves to raise awareness of the requirements of a career in the military.<\/p><p>In addition, recruitment teams frequently attend recruitment and career fairs and events to promote career opportunities within each branch of the organisation.  To date in 2022, the teams have attended 22 such events.\u00a0 The attractiveness of a career in the Defence Forces is emphasised at such events, including the opportunity for continuous upskilling and to avail of third level education.  A recently developed infographic on the benefits of a career in the Defence Forces also highlights this point.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces have also engaged a marketing and media partner to assist with recruitment advertising to ensure engagement with the recruitment demographic across social media and other platforms is as good as it can be.

On a specific question relating to that article, was the Minister informed at his recent trip to Cork that there was an impending need to tie up another navy ship due to staffing shortfalls?  Earlier this year, the Minister, along with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, announced &euro;2.4 million for the Defence Forces in connection with Science Foundation Ireland.  It is a clever initiative.  However, there are only six or seven educational qualifications that allow a person to become an engine room artificer with the navy.  What direct engagement has been had with those students on those courses in respect of pursuing a career in the navy?  It appears that those students are being poached by much higher paying employers.

I was not informed that another ship would potentially be tied up.  We are seeking to decommission three ships in the Naval Service.  That is well known at this stage.  To replace them, we have purchased two new ships that are coming from New Zealand and will be in at the end of the first quarter of next year.  We are then going to move ahead with the development of a multipurpose vessel which will be the largest ship ever commissioned in the Defence Forces and the Naval Service.  Obviously, that will take several years to develop.  There is a lot happening in terms of reorientating the fleet.  The Deputy is correct.  In order for that to work, we need to get more people into the Defence Forces or the Naval Service, which will shortly become the Irish navy.  Of course, we have plans to do that.  I can give the Deputy the details of all the inductions in 2021 and so far in 2022 afterwards, rather than reading them all out now.

The transfer was very successful.  It is important to say this.  The ship had quite a number of extra years of life and it was very useful at the time to the Maltese.  They were very thankful for it.  We have a close relationship with the Armed Forces of Malta in the context of joint training programmes, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Several options for the disposal of the ships are being examined.  One is disposal by safe and environmentally sound recycling via an EU-approved ship recycling facility.  Another is sale by auction, which is sale as seen, to a private or government buyer.  A third option is a government-to-government transfer or purchase of the ships.  We have purchased two in-shore patrol vessels from the Royal New Zealand Navy, and that was a government-to-government deal.  It is going to be very successful, and we got great value for money.  When people see the vessels, they will see why that is the case.  As I said, those vessels will be here early next year.  The final option is that we could donate the ships to be used as a possible visitor attraction, museum or visitor centre.  That is easier said than done.  It involves a cost.  I hope we can do it, but we must be careful that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces do not have to continue to manage vessels.  The whole idea of this exercise is to allow us to move on and look for more modern vessels.  If we can use the older vessels and if they can be managed under the auspices of Dublin Port or Cork County Council as a tourist attraction, then we are certainly open to that option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800057#GGG00900","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1656452400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the point made that if the<i>L&Eacute; Eithne<\/i>were to be turned into a maritime museum that it should not be up to the Defence Forces to foot the bill.

I am advised by the military authorities that there is an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Forces, part of which is\u00a0aimed at ensuring that, where at all possible, there is an appropriate work-life balance for its members.  The Defence Forces have piloted\u00a0new work-life balance initiatives, including reviewing how career courses are conducted to\u00a0make them more accessible to those with family commitments and facilitating job sharing for overseas deployments.  In this regard, prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, a number of family-friendly overseas appointments for commissioned and enlisted personnel\u00a0were introduced whereby the normal six-month tour of duty could be shared with another member of the Defence Forces, resulting in a three-month deployment.  There is scope, I understand,\u00a0to re-introduce these arrangements once all remaining restrictions pertaining to overseas deployments are lifted.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have also placed a renewed focus on members whose spouse or partner is also in the organisation, with a view to ascertaining how they can be assisted when their spouse or partner is deployed away from home.  This includes 24-hour duties while partners or spouses are deployed overseas, or for two years for a mother after the birth of a child.  A range of harmony measures have also been implemented, including hot-desking for certain enlisted and commissioned personnel who have been posted away from their home address, and remote working is considered for a limited number of personnel depending on the circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are also able to facilitate the periodic working from home of some personnel.  However, given the fundamental and specific nature of military service, there is limited capacity in this regard, as many Defence Forces appointments are not suitable to this practice.  Working from home is utilised for specific appointments for which it is suited and having regard to the requirement to develop and maintain an appropriate level of military capability. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the introduction of the Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations earlier this year and the commitments made\u00a0in the programme for Government relating to remote working across\u00a0the public sector, I confirm that the defence organisation is examining\u00a0these policies and commitments in the context of the unique nature of military service.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot going on but a lot more is coming in this space.  On the back of recommendations from the commission, we are about to introduce a new position of head of transformation, which will be a senior appointment within the Defence Forces, that will report directly to the Chief of Staff.  This position will be filled by a civilian who will focus on the management of people and quality of life issues, work-life balance, flexibility and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800058#HHH00700","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1656453000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.

First, remote working is not realistically going to be practical considering the nature of the work members of the Defence Forces undertake, particularly military as opposed to civilian staff.  Will there be a focus on the nature of domestic postings?  We appreciate the need for foreign postings, but there is a need to ensure that domestic postings are realistic to the housing and familial commitments of all members of the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  Second, regarding accommodation, what efforts have been looked at in terms of on-base housing?  In the Curragh Camp, a number of former officers' residences are boarded up at present.

One of the possibilities for the next few years, on the back of the commission report, is that we will see a radical restructuring of the Defence Forces, in particular the Army.  We will see a new Army headquarters, a new defence headquarters, a new structure headed up by a chief of defence for the first time in Ireland.  Senior decision makers in the Defence Forces will be civilians, such as head of transformation and head of HR management.  The commission has set very ambitious targets for us in terms of encouraging more women into the Defence Forces.  It is not just about women; it is also about young men coming into the Defence Forces.  In order to do this, we have to respond to the new realities which are that people expect more flexibility, they expect a work-life balance to be a part of their work.

If we are trying to narrow the scope of what we are asking the Defence Forces to do, that is one area where they have done a fantastic job, but I think the Prison Service should be able to replicate that work without having Defence Forces personnel in Portlaoise Prison.  That takes up a lot of resourcing and is quite expensive, and I think the Defence Forces could be used elsewhere more effectively in their core role.  That is a recommendation in the report.

We envisage that the cyber role of the Defence Forces will be increasingly important in security terms.

In the middle of a pandemic, we experienced a cyberattack on our health system which meant that many of our hospitals were run on paper-based systems for quite a period.  I estimate it cost the State well over &euro;100 million to resolve that issue.  There are vulnerabilities there that we need to guard against but primary responsibility, in terms of Government Department for cybersecurity for the State, does not rest with the Department of Defence but with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.

What is the true number of potential patient safety incidents and deaths that have occurred in the hospitals under the management of the University of Limerick Hospital Group?  Serious safety incidents reported by conscientious professionals in University Hospital Limerick have not received attention.  Patients have raised concerns and staff members have brought concerns to hospital management without officially reporting the incidents for fear of the impact it might have on their careers.  These concerns are often ignored and buried without following protocol.  Some of these incidents have led to serious injury and the deaths of patients.  Families are not aware of how their loved ones were injured or died.  This became very clear to me when a young 18-year-old girl, Jessica Sheedy, from my local area died in University Hospital Limerick following surgery.  She would not have died if management had done its duty and reported previous serious incidents through the proper channels.  This is how serious the situation is in the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Whistleblowers in University Hospital Limerick are silenced by management.  They are worn down until they sign non-disclosure agreements.  How many protected disclosures are investigated properly?  If proper procedures had been followed by University Hospital Limerick management, it would not be in the catastrophic state it is in because the State authorities would have been alerted much earlier to the dangers to the public in the accident and emergency department and the six hospitals under the management of the hospital group.  I am asking for a public inquiry into the number of incidents recorded in University Hospital Limerick that have not been reported nationally.<\/p>  <p>  University Hospital Limerick management has a duty of care to the public.  It should be made accountable, criminally accountable if necessary.  A public inquiry should not be carried out by past or present HSE employees.  This is always the case when families are informed that a so-called independent investigation will be carried out.  So-called external investigations are often misleading and inaccurate.  External organisations should investigate.  Should University Hospital Limerick management be allowed to risk the safety of the public to hide dangers?  It has tried to cover up incompetence and negligence through deceit and corruption.  It has not been made accountable.  What will the Minister for Health do to prevent future harm to the public in this hospital in the meantime?  Will the Minister for Health ask the Garda to conduct a criminal investigation into the situation?

I acknowledge his interest in University Hospital Limerick and the important role it plays in delivering healthcare in the mid-west region.  We are all familiar with the difficulties faced by University Hospital Limerick.  It was because of these difficulties the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, visited the hospital in February.  Following that visit he requested that a HSE expert team review the day-to-day functioning of the emergency department in University Hospital Limerick in a leadership, management, operational and clinical context.  The report from the review will seek to identify what is required locally, regionally and nationally to support sustained improvement in the emergency department.  The expert team will also continue to support and work closely with University of Limerick Hospital Group and the CHO in the mid-west to support improvements in unplanned emergency care and access to scheduled care.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the review requested by the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, University Hospital Limerick commissioned Deloitte to review and advised on unscheduled care and patient flow in the hospital.<\/p> <p>The review is still in train.  When available, the expert team will also consider the recommendations in its own report.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, we recently saw the publication of HIQA's report of the unannounced inspection of the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick against the national standards for safer better healthcare.  The Minister has welcomed the report and expressed his concern about the significant risk identified to service users in it.<\/p> <p> On Wednesday last, the Minister met with senior officials from his Department and the HSE to discuss immediate responses to the pressures currently faced by emergency departments throughout the country.  Those discussions included a specific engagement in respect of the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, in the context of the specific pressures being experienced by the hospital, and the reports by both HIQA and the HSE expert team recently deployed to Limerick at the Minister's request.<\/p> <p> As a result of the intervention requested by the Minister and the recent HIQA report, the chief operations officer of the HSE has written to the CEO of the University of Limerick Hospital Group and the chief officer of mid-west community healthcare to inform them that she has mandated the performance management improvement unit, PMIU, of the HSE to engage urgently with the hospital group and the CHO under the HSE's performance accountability framework.  The PMIU will provide intensive support to both hospital and community teams to ensure that the safety issues identified in the recent assessment and the HIQA report, including chronic overcrowding, are addressed as a matter of urgency.  A detailed plan will be developed as a matter of urgency in order to ensure that they do not reoccur.  This plan will cover issues including admission avoidance, pre-admissions, community interventions and alternative pathways, as well as issues with regard to patient flow through the hospital and emergency department.<\/p> <p> I assure the Deputy that the work under way to address the issues that University Hospital Limerick faces, including those highlighted by HIQA's report, will make a significant difference to patient experience at University Hospital Limerick.  The Department of Health continues to work closely with the HSE to ensure University Hospital Limerick is fully supported and that the recommendations of the expert review team are actioned in a timely manner.

Many Deputies asked for University Hospital Limerick to be investigated.  The Minister went down at the time and found nothing wrong.  I spent nights in that hospital after having a serious accident in February.  I saw first-hand all the people on trolleys.  It was being denied in different places that people were on trolleys, but I saw it first-hand.  I have spoken about this to the parents of the person I named.

The PMIU will provide the intensive support needed to ensure that all necessary immediate steps are taken to address the safety issues identified, included chronic overcrowding.  On foot of the PMIU's engagement, a detailed plan will be urgently developed to ensure that they do not reoccur.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully aware of the impact on patients, their families and the mid-west.  Intensive efforts are under way to address difficulties currently facing University Hospital Limerick.  I also thank the Deputy for the way he put this matter across.  It has been very emotional and I will bring his views to the Minister.  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE to ensure support for the improvement of services for all patients attending the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800062#MMM00600","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","time":1656455400,"counter":525,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800062#MMM00750"},{"type":"speech","time":1656455400,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I previously raised the case of a 13-year-old boy who was referred to an orthodontics department on 8 August 2019 and not offered an assessment until 3 March 2022.  His family was also informed that if he needed treatment, he would have to wait five years for it.  When I inquired about this, the HSE also confirmed that the consultant orthodontist for south-east community healthcare carries out all assessments in Clonmel clinic and that the consultant is available one day every fortnight.  Leaving aside the fact that a child can be expected to be on a waiting list for five years, the fact that it took more than two and a half years for him to be assessed by a consultant who is available in Clonmel for one day every two weeks is a complete failure.  I understand that Covid had an impact but that is no excuse for how long children have to wait, either for assessments or the procedures they need.<\/p>  <p>  I was recently contacted by the parents of another 13-year-old in Tipperary.  This girl was assessed by the consultant orthodontist on 23 December 2021 and was added to the waiting list for treatment.  The family was told that she can expect to wait approximately 48 months before being offered an appointment.  The family was then told that if their daughter was found to require surgery to correct jaw-size discrepancy and so on, she can expect to wait another 36 months for an initial assessment with a consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon.  This means that the girl could have to wait until she is 20 years of age.  This young lady's father was told by the orthodontist that while she would have liked to deal with this immediately, her hands were tied because of understaffing and underfunding, and hence the length of the waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  The orthodontist said that she would like to see the girl given a block brace.  Doing this could avoid any need for surgery in the future.  It will only be effective if the brace is administered in the very near future, while the girl is still young.  If she has to wait until she is in her late teens or even in her early 20s, as she has been told, then surgery is more likely.<\/p>  <p>It is a problem because it would be more invasive and it would ultimately cost the HSE and the State even more.<\/p> <p> There is another complication facing the family.  If they went a private route now and got the brace that way, they are concerned that if their daughter needed some form of surgery in future, they would have to continue to rely on the private system.  They cannot get the services they need in the required timeframe and if they go private, it would make things very tight for them, although it would address their daughter's needs.  They would be disqualified from follow-up treatment, however.  They are precluded from being able to avail of the treatment their daughter deserves from the State.  They are in a lose-lose position.<\/p> <p> This family has an immediate need.  Is the Department going to fail this young lady or can something be done to ensure she gets the treatment she needs when she needs it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800062#MMM00800","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656456000,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to address the question of waiting lists for orthodontic services.  He mentioned the case of a young lady awaiting treatment and if he sends me the details, I will pass them to the Minister as well.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have the greatest level of need and have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday.  An orthodontic assessment determines if the referral meets the criteria for the service and, if so, what priority the patient is given.  Those with greatest clinical need are prioritised.  Orthodontic services are generally provided by orthodontic consultants and specialist orthodontists, who are based in HSE orthodontic clinics throughout the country.  In addition, orthodontic therapists assist in providing services in some areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister accepts there are significant delays in accessing some services provided by the HSE, caused in part by the necessary concentration of resources at managing the Covid-19 pandemic, the cyberattack and challenges in recruitment of staff in some areas of the country.  Waiting lists vary regionally and according to the complexity of the condition.  There are generally longer waiting lists for the least complex care.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of the first quarter of 2022, over 10,000 people were awaiting treatment.  However, a further 12,000 children were in active treatment.  The HSE has put in place a number of measures to address waiting times and these include the prioritisation of the filling of permanent vacancies.  The HSE is prioritising the filling of these permanent vacancies and a consultant orthodontist has recently been recruited for community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6, in Loughlinstown, County Dublin.  Competitions are ongoing to recruit additional consultant orthodontists in CHO 5 in the south east and in CHO 4 in Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  In the third quarter of 2021, the HSE extended the orthodontic procurement programme that allows patients to have treatment with private specialist orthodontists.  Under the updated framework, children and young people assessed as grade 4, whose care can be appropriately dealt with in a community practice setting and who have been waiting over four years, are offered treatment.  To date, over 1,612 patients have accepted transfer and are currently in treatment.  To support this procurement programme in 2022, the Minister made &euro;4.1 million available for orthodontics as part of the waiting list action plan.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is also developing a standardised approach to assessment with consultant and specialist orthodontists and annual training for referring dentists.  The purpose of this is to ensure that all referrals will receive an orthodontic assessment within six months and that the number of inappropriate referrals will be reduced.  Access to orthodontic treatment in another EU jurisdiction is available under the EU cross-border healthcare directive for patients that are already on an orthodontic treatment waiting list.  Many patients in Border areas have accessed care in Northern Ireland through this route pre-Brexit.  This is being continued through the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that the Minister for Health fully acknowledges that the waiting lists for essential orthodontic treatment are unacceptable and the Minister wants to see real improvement this year with the significant funding that the Government has made available.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It is simply unacceptable that the waiting lists are far too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800063#NNN00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1656456000,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State's comments but the response does not even mention the four-year waiting list, which is shocking.  This family does not need facts and figures and the girl needs treatment instead.  That is the only thing that will help her.  Her father has told us that this young girl is very good at sports and is a very bright child, with a good future ahead of her in school and college.  The comments from others, however, are causing psychological harm and holding this girl back.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Department of Health approved the private treatment for waiting lists initiative, with an allocation of &euro;1 million per year to target patients who had been waiting for over four years for treatment.  The Department accepting that only those waiting for more than four years would have action taken is completely and desperately wrong, as the Minister of State would admit.  It is my suspicion that delays being experienced across the country by children will result in two trends.  The first is that the number of children waiting over four years will increase all the time, as we can see when they come to everybody's office.  More children will have to be referred for private treatment as a result.  The second issue is that some children are being forced to live with deterioration, so more will require more intensive surgery, adding to the number of children qualifying for the private treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Children in this position need immediate treatment and not a fake promise of what will be done in years to come.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, what is being done to improve access to treatment?  Does he have plans to change criteria to allow more children to access private treatment in order to prevent their condition from getting worse?  What can be done in this case and how can the family ensure the timely treatment of their child?<\/p>  <p>  Towards the end of last year there were 1,123 patients waiting for HSE orthodontic service in my area of the south east, along with 506 in the mid west.

As I outlined to the House, the Department and the HSE are undertaking a number of initiatives to address the question of waiting lists for orthodontic care.  The Government is committed in the coming years to the transformation of oral healthcare services in accordance with the guiding principles set out in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the national oral health policy, which was published in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Under that policy, all children up to 16 years will receive eight oral healthcare packages, including examinations, assessments, advice, prevention interventions, emergency care and referrals as appropriate.  The packages will be provided in a primary care setting by oral healthcare practitioners contracted by the HSE.  With respect to orthodontic services, the policy supports the delivery of some orthodontic procedures in primary care dental practices, supported by clinical care pathways.<\/p>  <p>  The policy recognises that in line with international evidence, some orthodontic care may be provided in different types of primary oral healthcare settings where the level of skill of the oral healthcare practitioner will match the complexity of care required.  Orthodontic treatment involving inpatient surgical interventions and multi-specialty advanced care will be provided in advanced oral healthcare settings.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte provides the groundwork to transform oral health services and it embraces the same ideals as Sl&aacute;intecare, with the needs of people at the core and the provision of services in the local community paramount.<\/p>  <p>  Again, if the Deputy wishes to send the details of that young girl to me or the Minister, we will follow up with the HSE and see if there is any way the matter can be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800063#NNN00400","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","time":1656456000,"counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800063#NNN00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1656456000,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I am here to address the very significant and gross underfunding of Galway County Council, which has been a factor in seriously diminishing the capacity of that local authority to be able to offer the service to people that it should seek to offer.  This gross underfunding has been going on for many years and the history is quite complex, so I will not go into that.  It is stark in terms of the figures presented to us right now, however, by the executive management team within Galway County Council.<\/p> <p>Looking at the budget <i>per capita<\/i>allocated last year to local authorities with a similar demographic and similar make-up in terms of their rural-urban divide and of a similar size, Longford had a budget <i>per capita <\/i>of &euro;1,500; Waterford had a budget <i>per capita<\/i>of &euro;1,320; Tipperary had &euro;1,200; Mayo, &euro;1,250; and Kerry &euro;1,200.  Then we go to Galway, with a budget <i>per capita<\/i>of &euro;800.  That significant underfunding is seriously impacting on the recruitment and retention of staff within that local authority.  In 2008 there were 1,006 people employed by Galway County Council.  Just last year, that figure had reduced to 804.  We contrast that staff figure of 804 for Galway County Council with a figure of 1,800 for Tipperary, 1,240 for Kerry and 1,025 for Mayo.  Both the public representatives, the members of the local authority and indeed the management team there tell me that in order to address that gross underfunding, we are looking at a shortfall of roughly &euro;20 million.<br\/><br\/>Whenever this case is raised with the respective Ministers responsible for the funding of all of our local authorities, we are told we must wait for the outcome of an ongoing review of our local property taxation system to see how we can use the proceeds of that local property tax to bring about an equalisation of all of the funding that is made available to local authorities across the country, and that we will then move forward collectively following that review.  Before that review is finalised and before we set about carrying out its recommendations, Galway County Council in order to be brought to a level footing with all of those local authorities needs to have that immediate injection of &euro;20 million.<br\/><br\/>Right now, the funding shortfall is impacting seriously on its capacity to deliver services, for example in the area of planning.  Planning enforcement is now virtually non-existent within Galway County Council.  Indeed, dealing with the massive additional number of planning applications that have arisen over the last 12 months has been very difficult indeed.  In the area of housing grants for older people, what should be a very straightforward process of assessment of those grant applications is now taking up to nine months because there simply are not enough people working in that section to be able to adequately assess the grant applications and make the necessary grants.  Particularly in the area of housing, every local authority in the country has been rightly charged with delivering on a major local authority housing programme.  Again, in this area Galway County Council simply does not have the engineering or administrative staff to even go close to delivering on its commitment for local authority housing delivery over the next five to ten years.  <br\/><br\/>This needs to be addressed.  It has been going on for far too long.  The underfunding of &euro;20 million needs to be looked at in the immediate future and not in the long term after some ongoing review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800063#NNN00600","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656456600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to outline the funding and Government support for local authorities with particular reference to County Galway.  Local property tax, LPT, was introduced to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue and associated expenditure decisions.  The LPT broadens the tax base by reducing the level of Central Funding required by local government.<\/p>  <p>  Local retention of local property tax began in 2015 and since then the overall principles and allocation methodology have broadly remained the same.  Currently, 80% of LPT is retained in the area it is collected, with the other 20% supporting equalisation for local authorities with LPT bases lower than their funding baseline.  LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amount to &euro;523.9 million.  These allocations include the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.3 million.  Galway County Council was allocated &euro;14.5 million under this process for 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the LPT allocation, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has also agreed a provisional allocation of &euro;4.44 million for Galway County Council in respect of the additional costs that will arise in 2022 as a consequence of the national pay agreements.  This allocation relates specifically to increases in rates of pay and public service pension reduction resulting from the unwinding of financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, and increases in pay and pensions relating to Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022.  The overall aim of the allocation is to ease the burden on local authorities of the increased payroll costs in 2022.  As part of the budget process, the Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerning the financial impact on the sector and secured the allocation, which will assist local authorities to meet the costs arising.<\/p>  <p>  Across all schemes and funding sources the Department provided &euro;82.9 million in 2020 and &euro;85.9 million in 2021 to Galway County Council.  The payments in 2020 also included an allocation to Galway County Council of &euro;1 million.  This funding was linked to the operation of municipal districts and was subject to a small number of requirements, including that the funding be divided equally among the municipal districts.  The payments in 2021 included an allocation of &euro;600,000 for additional discretionary income.  The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to bringing forward LPT reforms including providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county.  The Government has signalled its intention that the move to 100% local retention of LPT will be introduced over the 2023 and 2024 budgetary cycles.  It is expected that the LPT yield will change following revaluation last November and the distribution model will be reviewed when new yield per local authority is fully quantified; however final figures are not yet available.  Given the need for timely information to be provided to local authorities for their budgetary process and the need for final LPT figures to inform that, it is not expected that baselines will be reviewed in advance of the 2023 local authority budget process.<\/p>  <p>  Each local authority situation is complex and it is important that sufficient time is taken to analyse and assess potential options in that respect.  Preliminary census data will also form an important input to that deliberation.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will, however, be considering, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the potential for a move towards 100% retention for 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800064#OOO00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1656456600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I am not laying any blame at the Minister of State&rsquo;s door for that response.

That does not address the situation that Galway County Council, even after that review and after the allocation of additional LPT across all local authorities, would still be at a major disadvantage with the &euro;20 million shortfall.  What needs to happen right now is for that inequity to be addressed.  Galway County Council needs to be brought into line with other local authorities of similar demographic make-up and similar size.  It is not acceptable that a local authority in one part of the country has to cope with doing its work with 800 staff while another similarly sized local authority has 1,800 staff.  That inequity has existed for a very long time.  It needs to be addressed completely separately from this ongoing local property tax review.  That is the message and I would be very grateful if the Minister of State could bring it back to the Ministers responsible for this budgetary allocation.  The local authority members in Galway County Council are about to begin their own budgetary process, trying as best they can to allocate scarce resources across all of the provision within that local authority.

I keep getting the same answers.  I have also tabled parliamentary questions.  The first thing we have to recognise is that transport costs take a disproportionate amount of islanders' incomes.  In many cases, they need to keep two cars &ndash; one on the island and one on the mainland.  Only two islands have roll-on roll-off, ro-ro, ferries.  Every time they go to the mainland, they have to take public transport.  The rest of us do not, but they do.<\/p>  <p>  It was in recognition of this that back in 1997 I introduced subsidised ferry services over a very short number of years to virtually every island off the coast.  Until then, there was a hodgepodge of subsidised services, but none of the non-Irish speaking, or non-Gaeltacht, islands had any subsidised service.  The second thing I did later on was to introduce an islander rate.  In other words, if the Minister of State or I takes the boat, we pay the ordinary commercial rate.  However, on the subsidised services, there is an islander rate that is much lower.  It was &euro;8 for an adult but I think it is &euro;10 now.  However, it is still much lower than the commercial rate that a tourist or visitor would pay.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister keeps telling me that she cannot do this because there are subsidised and non-subsidised services going to the islands.  This is a mantra that is probably in the Minister of State&rsquo;s script tonight as well.  Two things arise from that.  The non-subsidised services are not bound by this &euro;10 fare.  They do not have to give islanders a reduced rate and they do not.  They have never complained that the subsidised services are subsidised to give this rate.  The second thing is whether the Minister of State can tell me where all these islands are the Minister keeps telling me about, which I have not heard of, that have subsidised and non-subsidised services running in parallel.  I do not want to hear that there is a service from Doolin to the Aran Islands in the summer and that the service from Ros an Mh&iacute;l is competing with it.  The subsidised islander rate is only available in Ros an Mh&iacute;l.<\/p>  <p>  This issue has dragged on.  It is amazing that on the mainland you have subsidised and non-subsidised services.  As the Minister of State knows, Expressway is not subsidised and is not subject to the reduction in fares and neither are many other private bus operators.  This idea that there is some massive difference between the islands and the mainland is wrong.  In fact, it is the other way around.  The mainland has a mixture of services all over the place - some are subsidised and some are not, and all of them licensed by the National Transport Authority, NTA, as I understand.  <\/p>  <p>  In a reply to a parliamentary question last week, the Minister said that at last she had received the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice that had been sought in March of this year.  Remember, this scheme is only going to run from April to December.  How this was such a massive legal issue that it took from March to the end of June to get an answer, I will never understand.  If the Minister of State can tell me the matter has been considered and the Minister will drop the fare by 20%, we need not go any further and one sentence will do as a reply.  We are all here late at night and it is unnecessary.  I am told this is being considered by the officials.

The sustainability of the communities on our offshore islands is a core objective of the Government, as the Deputy knows, and is set out in its Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, Our Rural Future.  The policy acknowledges the importance for island communities of access to reliable, safe and affordable connectivity services to and from the mainland.  I do not have to be telling the Deputy because he is very familiar due to the work he has done over the years.<\/p>  <p>  Contracts for these services are procured by the Department of Rural and Community Development on the open market through the procurement process.  This ensures that all potential providers are treated equally and the selection process is fair and transparent for all.<\/p>  <p>  The fare reduction scheme recently introduced by the Department of Transport is managed by the NTA and only targets the PSO bus and train routes under its remit, as the Deputy outlined.  The scheme covers public transport services operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Luas, Go-Ahead Ireland and Transport for Ireland, TFI, Local Link.  It does not, however, include other subsidised transport services managed by the Department of Transport, such as the PSO air service to Donegal and Kerry, nor does it include private commercially operated services licensed by the NTA.  Furthermore, the scheme does not extend to transport services currently managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of supporting the island communities through reduced fares, the Deputy is aware that islanders already benefit from substantially reduced fare on the subsidised ferry and air services, representing a discount of up to 60% compared to the rate charged for visitors, which is where the &euro;8 or &euro;10 is.  Many offshore islands have a mix of subsidised and non-subsidised transport services, and introducing a new fare reduction scheme for chosen suppliers could have the potential to undermine those procurement procedures and may also lead to reduced services to the islands, particularly with regard to non-subsidised services and other private operators who may be placed at a disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development has sought advice from the Attorney General on this matter, as the Deputy said.

I would like him to outline the names of the islands that make up this &ldquo;many&rdquo;, given there are not that many islands around our coast.<br\/><br\/>The third issue is that the Minister of State has at last admitted - it is the only change in the reply I am getting <i>ad nauseam<\/i>- that there is a special islander rate but that it is confined to the subsidised services.  That is how they can afford to give that rate.  When someone wins the contract, they have advantages.  Nobody is asking for the visitor fare to be reduced, just the islander fare, which is already 60% lower.<br\/><br\/>I will make a final point as I am running out of time.  The Minister of State said they are not NTA services and they are not under the Department of Transport.  I know that.  However, these are Irish citizens who are availing of public transport.  People do not take a bus from an island to the mainland and they certainly do not take a train.  That part of the argument is totally false and is just throwing dust in the eyes, but not doing it very well.  What we are saying to islanders is very simple, and it is that they should not benefit from the reduction in public transport costs that the rest of the people on the mainland are benefiting from.  It is as simple as that.  If that is the Government's attitude, I have to say I am ashamed to be in a party that is part of that Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800065#PPP00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.

Careful consideration is being given to any change that could substantially alter the contracts and put private operators at a disadvantage.

There is also the fact of the logistical issues for people leaving the islands in that they often need to keep two cars and they also have to take public transport, which is a valid argument.
