This wide range of functions is reflected in the scale and detail of the annual report and of the financial statements, which were published in June.  Separate financial statements are provided for the different key functions.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 15 provides an overview of the NTMA&rsquo;s operations in 2020, and highlights a number of key developments in the year.<\/p> <p>  As I have already stated, the NTMA&rsquo;s primary function is to manage borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the national debt account.  After a long period of relative stability, Ireland&rsquo;s national debt increased significantly in 2020.  At the end of the year, the national debt stood at &euro;219.5 billion.  This represented a net increase of &euro;12.75 billion, or 6%, on the end of 2019 national debt.  The increase in 2020 was largely attributable to the additional funding requirements as a result of the deterioration in the public finances related to the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  While the debt level increased, the cost of servicing the national debt continued to fall in 2020, due to refinancing of the stock of debt at the prevailing low interest rates.  Total debt servicing costs in 2020 amounted to &euro;4.7 billion.  This was over &euro;500 million less than in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, show a reduction of &euro;2.3 billion, or 15%, in the value of the fund&rsquo;s net assets between the end of 2019 and the end of 2020.  The assets were valued at &euro;12.7 billion at the year end and were held in two portfolios: a directed investment portfolio, accounting for 31% of the net assets and a discretionary investment portfolio, accounting for 69%.  The loss incurred by the fund in 2020 was due to a drop of just over &euro;3 billion in the value of the directed portfolio, offset by an increase of just under &euro;700 million in the net asset value of the discretionary portfolio.  The fall in the value of the directed portfolio in 2020 followed a drop in value of over &euro;1 billion in 2019.  These losses were related to the fund&rsquo;s shareholding in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the Minister instructed the NTMA to make a &euro;2 billion fund available within the ISIF discretionary portfolio to support medium and large enterprises affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, through the provision of lending on a commercial basis.  Known as the pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, this facility was availed of by four businesses in 2020, to a combined value of &euro;237 million or just under 12% of the available fund.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements of the State Claims Agency record claims awards and settlements, and related expenses, totalling &euro;430 million in 2020.  This was similar to the level of expenditure incurred in 2019.  These costs are recovered by the agency from the relevant State authorities within its scope of operation.  The agency&rsquo;s estimate of the value of claims liabilities outstanding at the end of 2020 was &euro;4.03 billion.  This has been rising steadily over recent years.  Health sector bodies accounted for 92% of the estimated outstanding liability.  This includes claims related to the HSE&rsquo;s CervicalCheck programme.  During 2020, the HSE received notification of 100 such cases, bringing the total notifications to 234.  Of these, 22 had been concluded by the end of 2020.  Also during 2020, the scope of claims within the agency&rsquo;s remit was expanded to include the management of potential claims against private healthcare providers assisting in the public health response to the Covid-19 pandemic and in providing acute care generally under temporary contracting arrangements.<\/p> <p>  In late 2020, the Minister directed the NTMA to transfer assets to the value of &euro;1.5 billion from the national surplus reserve fund, also known as the \"rainy day fund\", to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  This amount represented the total balance on the rainy day fund, originally transferred from the ISIF in late 2019.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall the circumstances that gave rise to the creation of the Ireland Apple escrow fund in 2018, into which Apple deposited &euro;14.3 billion.  In terms of value, this fund is on the same general scale as the ISIF.  The NTMA has been delegated by the Minister for Finance to carry out, on his behalf, a range of functions in respect of the escrow fund.  This includes production of the annual audited financial statements of the fund, which are published separately from other NTMA accounts.  In line with the conservative investment policy agreed between the NTMA and Apple representatives, the escrow fund is invested in highly-rated, euro-denominated, fixed-income securities, or held as cash and cash equivalents.<\/p><p>These tend to be low-yielding investments.  In the current interest rate environment, some of these assets yield negative returns.  As at the end of 2020, the net assets of the escrow fund were &euro;13.984 billion.  This represents a decrease of &euro;36 million from the 2019 net assets balance of &euro;14.02 billion.  The operating costs of the fund for 2020 were &euro;7 million.<\/p><p> \"State savings\" is the combined named applied by the NTMA to a range of Government savings products offered to savers in Ireland.  Such savings include balances held in An Post deposit accounts.  These are accounted for in the financial statements of the post office savings bank fund.  The level of deposits by savers in their An Post accounts has been growing steadily in recent years, notwithstanding the reduced returns that can be earned due to the prevailing low-interest environment.  At end 2020, total deposits by savers were &euro;3.9 billion, up almost 15% from &euro;3.4 billion at end 2019.  The fund&rsquo;s net interest income and returns on investments have fallen significantly.  This is in contrast to the operating expenses incurred, which have been relatively static at approximately &euro;28 million a year.  As a result, the fund has incurred deficits each year since 2015, with the exception of 2019.  The deficit for 2020 was &euro;13.8 million.  As a result, the retained earnings of the fund continued to fall in 2020, standing at just under &euro;72 million at end 2020.  This compares with a peak of &euro;190 million in retained reserves in the fund reported at the end of 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633595400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I will summarise the opening statement, as the Chairman has suggested.<\/p> <p>  Starting with the funding and debt management area, which was the original business of the NTMA, it has been a pretty significant period post the pandemic and the unprecedented pro-cyclical response, which was the first pro-cyclical fiscal response in the history of the State, when the Government took the action it did post the pandemic.  That action has had the impact of keeping a floor under the economy and that policy has been enormously impactful.  All of that pandemic spending has been funded through borrowing and since the pandemic began we have borrowed just under &euro;36 billion at an average interest rate of 0.16%, or just under two tenths of 1%.<\/p> <p>  The fiscal responses that were replicated right across Europe were complemented by the activities of the European Central Bank, ECB, and that is a critical point for everybody to understand in terms of the context and environment in which we are operating.  It is not a single credit response from Ireland; this is Europe-wide.  In that context, the European Central Bank's actions have been extraordinary.  One of the things members will have read recently in the newspapers is that after the financial crisis, it took the ECB seven years to introduce quantitative easing but that, with the onset of the pandemic, it took only seven days for it to intervene with its bond-buying programmes.  That is not far from being exactly what happened.  The extent of the bond-buying engaged in by the ECB has been extraordinary.  European sovereigns are estimated to have issued &euro;1 trillion in total in 2020 and will issue approximately the same amount in 2021.  The ECB's bond-buying programmes have been expanded to almost the equivalent of that issuance.  The net issuance to investors is almost zero.  In essence, the ECB is buying sovereign bonds almost one for one and that is what has allowed Ireland and other sovereigns to borrow so much so cheaply and effectively.  The ECB, with its language and actions, is ensuring that that environment is likely to stay like that for quite a few years to come.<\/p> <p>  The other advantage we have is that we have termed out Ireland's debt significantly during this low-rate period.  We have one of the longest maturities in Europe, at just under 11 years, and we have one of the smoothest profiles in terms of our debt.  What I mean by that is that there is no one year where there is a significant disproportionate funding chimney or cliff .  The environment has allowed us to do that as well.  We also have significant amounts of cash in hand.  As a result, the debt profile and locking in those low interest rates for a very long period gives us significant-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1633595400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I have to interrupt Mr. O'Kelly because there is only a minute and a half left for the other speaker.

I will start with the escrow fund.  I note Mr. O'Kelly's comments in his opening statement.  The total net assets in the fund decreased by an alarming &euro;36 million in 2020 and, I think, &euro;16 million in 2019.  That brings the fund to &euro;13.98 billion, which is approximately 87.6% of its original value.  The matters before the European courts may take a few years -  and Mr. O'Kelly might offer his own opinion on that - but in terms of the exposure for the State, if this were to decrease further or go on for a number of years does Mr. O'Kelly estimate the amount in the fund dropping further?  Is there an exposure to the State if the fund is not managed and is decreasing in value all the time?  There is an equal relationship between Apple and the NTMA in managing the fund.  I ask Mr. O'Kelly to comment on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#B00900","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633595400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The fund is operating in a negative interest rate environment, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said earlier.  While it is quite difficult to get our heads around it, even for those of us who are professionals in the market, this fund is investing in sovereign bonds for the most part and the lowest-risk securities.  Its investment strategy is designed to protect the capital as much as possible in order that there is very little risk involved.<\/p><p>As I said in my statement, it is designed to produce a return of capital, not a return on capital.  It is not investing for returns; it is investing to protect that capital.  However, even in protecting capital in today's world, German Government bonds and even many Irish Government bonds trade at negative yield.  We benefit from that when we are borrowing, of course, but when we are saving or investing, as we are in this fund, that is the other side of the same coin.  In fact, when we designed and looked at the scenario analysis for this fund, when we first looked at the portfolio, we thought that the average yield on the fund, given the securities in which we were investing, would be minus 50 basis points.  On a portfolio of &euro;14 billion, that would be a loss of &euro;70 million per annum, so it was designed at the outset to potentially lose that amount unless the interest rate environment changed, and it has not.  That is the investment process.<\/p><p> I will ask Ms O'Halloran to talk about the timelines in terms of the Apple escrow, which is an important feature of determining our investment strategy.

That litigation is being managed by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Attorney General's office and legal advisers.

Deputy Devlin will see that the withholding tax that is referred to there was repaid and refunded in full to the fund in 2020.  The reason it was deducted in the first place was that our escrow agent custodian, Bank of New York Mellon, has the obligation to make the deduction, so it is its obligation to look after that, and it notified the NTMA and Apple that it had made a mistake in its classification of the escrow fund for US tax purposes.

I will break down incidents of cerebral palsy for the Deputy, by way of an example.  In 2016, there were 21 such cases.  In 2017, there were 24 such cases.  In 2018, there were 17 cases.  In 2019, there were 27 cases.  In 2020, there were 12.  In this year to date, there have been six.  That is a total of 107 to date.

From the State's perspective, for the protection of its citizens and from a financial perspective, it wants to avoid as many of those cases as possible.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions, the first of which is around the risk register and NIMS.  When something happens, it may not be apparent to the hospital or the parents that a brain injury has occurred.  Are hospitals consistently reporting incidents that were risky and concerning, and where they possibly do not know the outcome?  How is that translated then to what actually happens in terms of litigation?  Let us imagine a difficult birth with questions around it.  No one is sure how the child is.  The child may or may not be in the neonatal unit.

When the fund was set up, I said at the launch that I hoped none of the money would be drawn down.  This was not a target.  A fund worth &euro;2 billion was made available in the hope that it would not be needed, not that it would be needed.  This was designed for companies that ran into difficulty due to the pandemic.  The longer companies struggled and the more sectors that struggled, the more we would be needed.  As we see from all the available data, the economy is, thankfully, recovering quickly in the majority of sectors.  There are only a minority of sectors still affected by the pandemic, including the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors.  One can, therefore, imagine that they tend to be the focus but it is my hope that the funds will not be drawn down.<\/p> <p>  In addition, we are seen as an investor of last resort.  These companies are well managed and have their own shareholder base and financial providers.  If they need money, they can approach other providers of capital; it does not have to be the Government.  The Government is there as a safety net and the provider of investment capital of last resort.  Many companies are incredibly well managed and in good shape, and do not require the State's help thankfully.  My hope is that there will not be much more drawn down and we will get back to the original business of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is investing in key priority themes such as housing and regional development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1633595400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Will the remainder of that fund remain available for other sources of finance across the portfolio?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#H00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633595400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

Those mass actions increase the volume of claims and, as I said earlier, there is an inflationary effect of the decrease in the real rate of return - the personal injury discount rate - on the damages.

On corporation tax and certainty around Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental industrial model around attracting multinational corporations and having this dual engine economy, any threat to that or any change to that is understandably a concern and they are watching developments very closely.  It has been the position for the last year.  I do not know if Mr. O'Connor wants to comment as he has been on the road with investors &ndash; virtually, of course - for the last 12 months.

If we are going to have a 15% floor under the OECD rules, I presume our European neighbours will want to see us collecting the 15%.  What consequences does Mr. O'Kelly see that change having for revenue intake?  I take on board that the NTMA are the people with the listening ear.

I know it is not particularly under the remit of the NTMA but, obviously, what has happened there is connected to a lot of its work.  I thank the NTMA for the information and the map it sent to us in preparation for this meeting.  While it has its own board, it is semi-detached, if we like, from the NTMA.  We could try to explain this for a week but the map sets out clearly the NTMA's relationship with these three bodies, and the functions are listed underneath.<\/p> <p>  The par value of the impaired loans taken over by NAMA was &euro;74 billion.  It paid in the region of &euro;32 billion for those loans, and that was the bailout with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We had NAMA here last week.  It hopes to achieve around &euro;36 billion of a return, so we will get the &euro;32 billion back plus somewhere between &euro;4 billion and &euro;5 billion.  If we take everything into account, including revenue, we are probably talking of a sum closer to &euro;5 billion, so, at best, we will get somewhere close to &euro;37 billion.  However, that leaves us with just over &euro;37 billion of a gap.  That is the bit that sticks in the taxpayers&rsquo; craw and in the public&rsquo;s craw in terms of the bailout.  While NAMA explained this to us at length last week and it will gain from those assets and loans what was given to NAMA - the &euro;32 billion - and that bit extra in terms of &euro;4.5 billion to &euro;5 billion, there is still a &euro;37 billion or &euro;38 billion shortfall.<\/p> <p>  My question is this.  I would be of the opinion, from listening to economists and various other commentators over the last period, that a lot of that was sold too quickly, first, but also that it was sold in very large lots, which reduced the number of bidders.  Obviously, the more bidders there are, the more competitive the process is.  Is it Mr. O'Kelly's opinion, looking back now with hindsight, that had we been able to hold some of those portfolios for just a couple of years longer and subdivided them into smaller lots, we would have got a better outcome and would have been able to close some of that bailout and relieve the taxpayers of some of that liability they have been stuck with?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#N01000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633595400,"counter":256,"content":"<p>There are a couple of things.

I take the opposite view.  I do not think we do enough of them; not by a long shot.  There are a number of times when PPPs are a channel that is more attractive than others.  A major consideration is whether there is an interest in having things off-balance sheet due to worries about levels of debt?  Another major consideration is whether interest rates are low in absolute terms.  PPPs are essentially another way of locking in low interest rates for 25 years.  I would have argued for a long time that if those conditions pertain, then that is a period when the channel should be opened and more should be done.  When those circumstances are not in place, there is no worry about being off-balance sheet and you are happy with debt levels, or if interest rates go significantly higher in nominal terms, then I would pull back on PPPs.<\/p> <p>  Circumstances at the moment are so favourable that we want to do as much off-balance sheet as possible.  Interest rates are low and are effectively being locked in.  I find the current environment to be attractive for doing PPPs.  I do not think the State does enough of them.  I would like to see us doing more, especially for social housing.  The NDFA has produced its first 1,500 social houses at attractive costs.  On average, it was &euro;250,000 to build each of the houses.  It pays about 3% to investors to manage those PPPs and finance them for us over 25 years.  They are high-quality houses which have been effectively and efficiently built.  We should do much more of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1633595400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I put it to Mr. O'Kelly that some PPPs have not turned out so well.  For example, the total cost to the State of the Convention Centre Dublin was reported to be &euro;416 million.  It was discovered later that the State could have built it for about half that amount.  The company that the OPW partnered with, Spencer Dock Development Company, went into liquidation and had to be bailed out by NAMA.  This entity here, the Oireachtas, had to rent back, or pay a charge - some people dispute the use of the word \"rent\" - of &euro;25,000 a day for it afterwards.  The Limerick tunnel is underused.  Mr. O'Kelly knows that last year, especially during the strict six or seven-week lockdown due to Covid, traffic volumes went down dramatically.  There was a clause relating to when traffic volumes dropped below a certain level on those roads.  In the case of the Limerick tunnel, there could be a bill of hundreds of millions of euro.  Part of the N7 and N8 route goes through Laois.  It was constructed in the 2000s.  The taxpayer ponied up approximately 80% of the money for that and has to pay a maintenance fee of &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million a year.  I recall the figure clearly.  The motorist, who is the taxpayer, has to pay a toll.  After 25 years, when the road will need substantial repair, renovation and replacement of surfaces, repairs to foundations and so on, the taxpayer will then pay to get it back.  The cost over 25 years is a significant liability to the State and taxpayer.  Sometimes PPPs may be appropriate.  I do not argue that.  I am saying that a number which have not turned out to be good news for the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#O00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633595400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The NTMA is not involved in any of the transport PPPs.

It was taken to the Supreme Court for two years and challenged by one of the underbidders.  It was hit by the pandemic.  This month, 10,000 students will arrive on campus to fine infrastructure that has been delivered almost exactly on budget since the financial close five years ago, despite all of the cycles and what has happened, with just some small adjustments for inflation.  Compared with infrastructure that the State procures directly, it stands up extremely well.  Building infrastructure is tough.  We have many plans to build infrastructure.

With the financial risk to the State and the ongoing liabilities, it is one of the biggest issues that we face.

For example, if a risky incident has occurred, is the hospital board ever required by the State Claims Agency to present on the risk incidents that have occurred and the steps it took subsequently?

Obviously, there are incidents that result in outcomes other than cerebral palsy.  That is not the universe of experience in any sense.  Is that not very serious?  Those are 26 children and 26 families who are impacted with their lives entirely altered.  I am not suggesting this is a role of the State Claims Agency, but at what point does the State determine that 26 is just far too many?  In most cases these are caused by a failure to intervene in a timely way.  I am not suggesting that any number is an acceptable number of cases.  I am concerned that we have insufficient accountability from hospitals with the current scheme.  We have an inability to oversee it in a way that says we understand that there are situations where incidents will occur and there was nothing we could do about them but there are far too many incidents where we have had to admit liability and apologise where a timely intervention might have avoided it and its lifelong consequences.  Is it time now to review the clinical indemnity scheme?<\/p> <p>  I might come back to this in private session.  I think it is time the committee asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to review the clinical indemnity scheme.  I know he did a report on it in 2012.  It needs to look at the role of hospital accountability, risk incidents, reviews involving parents and the presentations to the State Claims Agency or others regarding risk incidents.  We need to mandate the opportunity for external reviews into hospitals to be done as a condition of continued participation in the clinical indemnity scheme.  We need to look at what protection we offer consultants, nurses and other people working in the hospitals who identify problems to parents and who are essentially quiet whistleblowers within the hospital system, rather than presenting any risk to them.<\/p> <p>  At the moment we have incident after incident.  Dr. Peter Boylan did a report on it and we are hearing it from the State Claims Agency today.  It impacts those families and those children for the rest of their lives.  It is too serious and the State is paying for it.  We see the level of exposure and the level of personal hurt.  I would like to discuss it in private session and I hope I will get the support of my colleagues in seeking a timely review by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#P01500","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633595400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I would like to make one response to the Deputy's remarks, purely to inform the debate.  The cerebral palsy rate in Ireland, which is 1.5 to 2 per 1,000 live births, is very much in line with the standard across the First World in terms of obstetric care.  The perinatal mortality rate, which is 3.5 per 1,000 live births, again reaches the level of not being out of step internationally.  Our maternal mortality rate, which is 5.4, compares very favourably, for example, with that in the UK, which is 9.7.  I absolutely accept that every case is a tragedy.  We do not want any case to occur, of course.  That would be the ideal situation, but just to inform the debate about where the relativities are, I thought it might be useful to offer those statistics.

However, approximately 10% to 12.5% of that, going back to the 1990s, is used in what we call the secondary trading market of Irish Government bonds, to add a little liquidity to investment for a return.

I outlined the situation with the convention centre.  As I understand it, the total cost to the State for it was &euro;416 million.  That was just the State's contribution.  There was a partnership with the Spencer Dock Development Company.  The total cost to the State hit &euro;416 million, but the assessment afterwards was that it could have been built at a total cost of &euro;200 million.  I mentioned the Limerick tunnel, the bill for which could run into hundreds of millions of euro as it was underused during the Covid period.  It will be similar for other motorways.  Another PPP that has been of interest over the past couple of years is the schools bundle.  Mr. O'Kelly said that the NTMA does not have a direct role in transport, but I am highlighting PPPs in general.  While there is a case to be argued for them, I am trying to highlight they also have major risks.<\/p> <p>  The PPPs for schools ran to 13% more than if they were constructed using direct billing.  We also finished up in a situation where private companies are not supervised on site.  The committee dealt with this last year.  There was a more than &euro;40 million cost for retrofitting those buildings.  As I understand it, the taxpayer took those hits.  That is substantial.  The broadband plan, which is not a PPP in name, and I followed this closely in the previous D&aacute;il because I had a responsibility as Opposition spokesperson on it, was done under what is called a gap model, but it is PPP.  We are giving between &euro;2.7 billion and &euro;2.8 billion to a private company, an American entity, to do the broadband plan.  Everyone's understanding was that the private entity would come up with 50%, or 30% to 40%, of the cost.  It turns out the private entity is coming up with a figure, in comparison with the cost to the State and taxpayer, of approximately 10% to 11% of the cost, which is somewhere in the region of &euro;270 million to &euro;280 million.<\/p> <p>  The taxpayer is taking all the risk with all those projects.  Irish Water has taken over liability on design build operate, DBO, projects from local authorities that are in the region of &euro;1.4 billion and there is an annual cost of servicing.  That is just a snapshot of some of them.  The point I am making is that while a public private partnership may not always be 50%, when the final figure for the national broadband plan came out it was just jaw-dropping.  I followed that very closely, as did others on this committee, in the various roles we had in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  We will finish up in a situation at the end of that project, where we will have broadband in rural areas that were not being serviced, not to mention all the other unusual aspects of it, but the cost will be enormous.  Does Mr. O'Kelly agree that the taxpayers' liability is enormous? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021100700002#R00900","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633595400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I cannot comment on PPPs I am not involved in.  We are involved in schools bundles so I will take that one for a moment.  Schools bundle 5 is a very interesting situation in that, as the Chairman will recall, Carillion in the UK went bust and a local contractor in Ireland, Sammon, went into liquidation.  One of the big issues with PPPs is, often, when something like that happens, whether the State will end up picking up the tab and the risk will transfer and stay with the private sector.  In schools bundle 5, which the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, had full oversight of, all those schools were built and completed at no extra cost to the taxpayer.  The contract was intact.  Other directly provisioned schools Sammon was involved in when it went into liquidation ended up costing the State very significant amounts of money.  It is a great comparison to look at schools bundle 5 following the collapse of Carillion and Sammon, what happened to those schools being built and who paid for them.  I think the Chairman will find that the PPP contract for schools bundle 5 stood up very strongly.<\/p> <p>  I know that sometimes, maybe, it does not.  It is all about that contract, what is in it and how robust it is.

It is inherently good work, particularly when it comes to blue flag and green schools initiatives.  It would be very useful for us to understand the financial relationship.
