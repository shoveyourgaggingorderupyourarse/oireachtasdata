The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a universal basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The Taskforce was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national. <\/p>  <p>  I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society; it includes a broad mix of employment types. This is an exciting proposal and has been the subject of positive commentary both nationally and internationally. We can now work to see how it can be enhanced.  <\/p>  <p>  I have established an Oversight Group with the remit of addressing the recommendations of Life Worth Living and particularly those which are outstanding.  The membership of the Group is drawn from departments and agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations, and to whom recommendations of the Taskforce are addressed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Oversight Group is being chaired by my Department joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members and they will be joined by a representative of the County and City Managers Association. <\/p>  <p>  I have asked the Oversight Group to prioritise the examination of Recommendation 1, a basic income for artists. I have engaged with relevant Ministerial colleagues on this matter and they have indicated their support for developing proposals. This would be independent of the work of the Low Pay Commission which has been tasked by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine the Programme for Government  commitment to pilot a Universal Basic Income within the lifetime of this Government commitment. I intend therefore to proceed with the development of proposals for a basic income for artists as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Programme for Government contained a commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine Universal Basic Income, informed by a review of previous international pilots, and resulting in a universal basic income pilot in the lifetime of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has requested the Low Pay Commission to examine the commitment in the Programme for Government and the Commission has agreed that this request will form part of its workplan for 2021.

Public information campaigns played a vital role in communicating the various strands of the pandemic. The campaigns informed citizens of all stages of restrictions as they were introduced and subsequently lifted.  Public information campaigns were also used to communicate with citizens on the supports being made available by Government to get through the pandemic.  Campaigns included information on business and wellbeing supports, postponement of Leaving Cert 2020, School Reopening and the Jobs Stimulus Plan.  Campaigns also encouraged the key behaviours necessary to control the virus. Campaigns communicated the Reopening plan in the Summer of 2020 and the National Framework for Living with Covid-19.<\/p><p>The scale of the communications challenge faced by Government was unprecedented, requiring public information campaigns across every sector of the economy and society.<\/p><p>The communications strategy for Covid-19 required national and international coordination.  A series of coordinated campaigns were developed to ensure maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community.The strategy aligned with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasised the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. <\/p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals.This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across a range of different information campaigns using national and local radio, national and regional newspapers, and social media platforms. The centralised approach adopted is helping to ensure effectiveness of advertising spend and consistency and amplification of the public health messaging across the various public awareness campaigns and to those hard to reach audiences. <\/p><p>The communications programme recognises the importance of ensuring as many people as possible receive the information they need in the format that suits them, using the appropriate channels and delivered in the appropriate way. They also understand that, for example, when trying to encourage particular behaviours that will protect communities and the health service, certain groups receive communications in different ways. The campaigns utilise platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.<\/p><p>The AntiViral campaign has been particularly effective. Following a significant increase in case numbers among 18-24 year olds in the autumn of 2020, GIS, the Department of Health and the HSE engaged with representative groups to understand the needs of this demographic. Insight generated from the research these groups had conducted confirmed that young people had been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, were concerned about it and its impact upon them and their loved ones.<\/p><p>It also revealed that they wanted this to be recognised and that they wanted information to be given to them in the appropriate way, by their peers. Taking this insight, we worked with an agency with a track record of communicating with this demographic and developed Antiviral &ndash; a campaign that encouraged this group to assume a leadership role in dealing with the pandemic, generating a movement they could relate to and that was delivered by their peers. The campaign continues to be very successful, utilising platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram. The campaign has evolved based on feedback from young people and the current strand of the campaign features the stories of young people who have been directly affected by the virus.<\/p><p>This campaign achieved overall impressions and reach of 18.8m and 1.48 million respectively. Engagement (a key metric as it indicates content that has resonated with an audience, causing them to actively interact with the content) has been striking, with an overall engagement of 288,787. On TikTok the level of engagement was 21%, far in excess of the industry standard of 6%. On Instagram, engagement was 36% again a notable achievement given the standard of between 3-5%.<\/p><p>In <b>2020<\/b>there was an expenditure of &euro;16.9 million on providing information to the public, across a range of platforms, on the various Covid-19 restrictions as they were implemented, the wide range of business supports, social welfare supports and community supports available and targeted measures. <\/p><p><b>In 2019,<\/b>the spend included &euro;12,000 on online advertising, and &euro;17,000 on video and radio ad production. My Department paid for public information campaigns relating to Budgets 2019 and 2020, for public consultation notices for draft language schemes, and for the &lsquo;<i>Votail100<\/i>&rsquo; commemorations.  There was also expenditure for advertisements relating to the recruitment of Judges.<\/p><p><b>In 2018<\/b>, the &euro;1.6m spend was across online, print, broadcast advertising, and production costs. The spend related to major cross-Government public information campaigns that the Department funded centrally. These campaigns included Healthy Ireland, Global Ireland, Project Ireland 2040 and the Self Employed Benefits campaign, aimed at ensuring self-employed people are aware of the new and existing benefits available to them. <\/p><p><b>In 2017, <\/b>the &euro;40,000 spend related to cross-Government public information campaigns on Healthy Ireland and Self-Employed benefits.<\/p><p><b>In, 2016,<\/b>the &euro;10,000 spend related to the Home to Work information campaign.<\/p><p>There have been 48 Covid-19 campaigns undertaken to date.

This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across a range of different information campaigns using national and local radio, national and regional newspapers, and social media platforms. The centralised approach adopted is helping to ensure effectiveness of advertising spend and consistency and amplification of the public health messaging across the various public awareness campaigns and to those hard to reach audiences. <\/p><p>The scale of the communications challenge faced by Government was unprecedented, requiring public information campaigns across every sector of the economy and society.<\/p><p>The communications strategy for Covid-19 required national and international coordination.  A series of coordinated campaigns were developed to ensure maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community.The strategy aligned with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasised the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. <\/p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals.This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across a range of different information campaigns using national and local radio, national and regional newspapers, and social media platforms.

IDA Ireland is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. The IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.<\/p>  <p>  Cork and Kerry make up the South West Region and has 211 client companies which collectively employ 46,009 people, while Clare and Limerick (along with Tipperary) are included in the Mid-West Region with 131 client companies employing 19,989 people.<\/p>  <p> The primary responsibility of the IDA is to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Ireland and to retain, transform and expand the existing base of client companies that have already invested and located here.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to FDI site visits represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas. \u00a0Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  2020 presented undeniable challenges to ongoing efforts to sustain and grow FDI in Ireland. The introduction of travel restrictions around the world disrupted the usual way the IDA engaged with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.<\/p>  <p>  In response to this, IDA Ireland migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities onto digital platforms and established a suite of digital content which can be accessed by potential investors. \u00a0The use of these digital platforms has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients, and in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The number of site visits, including E-visits, to end 2020 was: Limerick 26; Clare 16; Cork 30 and Kerry 1. Verified figures for end Q1 2021 are expected before the end of the month.\u00a0 It should also be noted that potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once.

For cross border consumer protection issues, the CCPC is part of the European Consumer Protection Co-operation (CPC) Network, which is comprised of national authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders, and allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues. The CPC Network is central to addressing this matter, which involved the purchase by consumers of properties in France. These properties were developed, marketed, sold and managed by French traders under a French &lsquo;Residence de Tourisme&rsquo; scheme devised by the French Government to provide tourist accommodation in France. Under the European CPC network, the appropriate authorities to conduct an investigation in relation to this matter are the French consumer protection authorities &ndash; Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). <\/p><p>The CCPC has engaged with the DGCCRF with respect to the issues highlighted by Irish property purchasers. The CCPC received complaints from Irish property purchasers and provided an initial preliminary assessment to the DGCCRF for over 150 complainants. Following consultation with the DGCCRF, the CCPC collated and transferred to the DGCCRF the transactional documentation of over 150 Irish property purchasers. The CCPC has and continues to provide significant time and resources to this matter and to supporting the DGCCRF investigation. In addition, throughout the period of engagement with the DGCCRF, whenever issues have been raised by Irish property purchasers, the CCPC has passed these on to DGCCRF and taken whatever additional steps requested by DGCCRF. <\/p><p>The DGCCRF are investigating the issues that were referred to the CCPC by the individuals involved. The primary focus of the CCPC is to continue to support the DGCCRF investigation through providing any assistance or information requested by the DGCCRF. The CCPC considers this matter as a high priority issue and one which we have dedicated considerable resources to. When DGCCRF have completed their investigation, the DGCCRF will provide to the CCPC, information on any potential concerns or infringements with respect to Irish agents identified during the course of their investigation. At that point, the CCPC will assess the information provided by the DGCCRF in order to determine whether there may have been a breach of consumer protection legislation by Irish traders. Following any such assessment, the CCPC will decide the necessary next steps.<\/p><p>In relation to the question of mortgages being sold by an unlicensed mortgage provider, there is limited information in the PQ to provide a comprehensive response. However, generally, I would point out that  the authorisation of mortgage providers is a matter more appropriate to the Central Bank. Given the context of the query, it is also not clear whether the mortgage provider in question was an Irish operator or operating outside of the jurisdiction. The Central Bank may be able to provide further information in relation to the requirements of mortgage providers and the consequence of operating without a license. If the mortgage provider was based in another jurisdiction, the Central Bank may also be in a position to advise who the relevant financial regulator might be. The Central Bank has a page on its website where unauthorised firms can be reported.

More than 50 of these are planned in total. My Department is also\u00a0making &euro;2 million\u00a0available\u00a0this year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative\u00a0will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.<\/p><p>In addition to the ESB project, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place since September 2019 and will continue to be available\u00a0during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who do<\/p><p>not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs. To date no chargers have been installed by local authorities under the scheme. The\u00a0SEAI has, however,\u00a0received requests from\u00a013 local authorities for applications<\/p><p>under the scheme and two completed applications\u00a0from Louth County Council and Dublin City Council to install a total of 29 charge points within their administrative areas. These applications are currently being assessed\u00a0for approval.\u00a0<\/p><p>Combined with an effective public\u00a0charging\u00a0network, Ireland's home\u00a0charging\u00a0policy will help sustain and service the expected growth\u00a0of electric vehicles on Irish roads.\u00a0Charging\u00a0while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle\u00a0charging\u00a0in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home\u00a0charging\u00a0as the most common and cheapest form of\u00a0charging.\u00a0To support home\u00a0charging, the SEAI, on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.<\/p><p>Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home\u00a0charger\u00a0grant to include shared parking in\u00a0apartment\u00a0blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking.\u00a0My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues.<\/p><p>On new builds, it should be noted that the EU energy performance and buildings directive requires member states to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is installed in all new residential and non-residential buildings as well as those buildings with more than ten car parking spaces for the purpose of enabling the installation of a larger stage of charging points for electric vehicles. This is currently being transposed into Irish law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800086#WRH03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800086#WRH03800"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[21175\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800086#WRH03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if an application for funding has been received from Dublin City Council or Fingal County Council for the pedestrian crossing or flyover at the roundabout located at the M1-R104 intersection in Santry, Dublin 9.","asker":"1568","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>As\u00a0Minister\u00a0for\u00a0Transport, I have\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0policy\u00a0and overall\u00a0funding\u00a0in relation to public\u00a0transport.

Accounting for a little over one fifth of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, there can be no question, but that transport must feature strongly in contributing towards the national decarbonisation effort.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Development Plan (NDP) underpins all State investments. The NDP is currently undergoing review, as such, the scale of investment in the transport sector is also being reassessed. Meanwhile, my Department\u00a0recently launched the National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland for public consultation, seeking views on\u00a0investment priorities and ensuring transport investment is aligned with the Government&rsquo;s overarching objectives. In addition, through the development of the forthcoming Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2021, significant analytical and modelling work is underway to identify the cost of delivery of the various measures required to achieve a 51% reduction in national emissions by 2030, as has been committed to in the Programme for Government. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of finalising CAP 2021 it is difficult to attribute meaningful costs to\u00a0sectoral emission savings. Nevertheless, what is clear is there will be significant costs, and the extent of these and the question of where they fall, will be strongly determined by precise type of mitigation action taken, the scale of the action and the timing of its deployment. Analysis previously undertaken by my Department suggests that there are a variety of different ways of achieving an indicative 1% reduction in transport emissions, each with significantly different corresponding cost. For example, it was estimated that replacing c.57,000 older combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles could yield approximately a 1% emission savings at a cost to the State of c.&euro;630m if there were continuation of current subsidy levels. A 100% increase in rail passenger kilometres or a 300% increase in bus passenger kilometres could also respectively mitigate 1% of transport emissions. Both of those potential measures would require significant capital investment in the region of &euro;3-5 billion as well as additional annual current funding for operating costs. This analysis is indicative only and the corresponding costs are approximations, and it should be noted that the costs of potential measures would vary over time, often in line with changes in technological development and market forces. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are continuing to work with colleagues across Government in preparing the forthcoming CAP 2021, and I expect that the agreement of that Plan and of the direction of future measures will provide greater clarity on the expected costs associated with reducing transport emissions\u00a0in line with the national climate objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800086#WRH06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[21208\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800087#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost to the State of reducing fares on public transport by 10%, 25% and 50%, respectively;

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, must play a central role in the national decarbonisation effort. The national car and van (LGV) fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the\u00a02019 Climate Action Plan,\u00a0and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The Government, supported by the work of the\u00a0Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have\u00a0collectively contributed\u00a0to increased take up\u00a0of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are 11 commercial and 8 non-commercial\u00a0agencies under the remit of my Department. \u00a0I have forwarded the Deputies question to each agency for direct response.\u00a0 Please contact my\u00a0Office if no reply is\u00a0received within 10 working days.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are 27 vehicles registered to my Department,\u00a0all of which are run on diesel or petrol.

This target is very challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceilings in future years.<\/p>  <p>The transition of the taxi and hackney fleet (technically called Small Public Service Vehicles - SPSVs) towards zero\/low-emission vehicles has an important role to play in effecting a substantial reduction in transport CO2  \u00a0and of air pollutant emissions, particularly in Irish towns and cities due to the high mileage travelled by these vehicles, the stop\/start and idling nature of their work, as well as the predominance of fossil fuels within the sector. Increasing the uptake of electric vehicles in the SPSV sector also has a strong leadership and demonstration effect on the public, introducing more people to low\/zero emission mobility options. As such, I was delighted to announce the continuation and extension of the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme in 2021. The Scheme which is administered by the NTA\u00a0provides enhanced supports for eligible taxi and hackney drivers switching to EVs. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, at Budget time, I announced a 2021 allocation of &euro;15 million which will support up to 750 taxi and hackney drivers in scrapping their older vehicles and replacing them with zero-emission capable electric alternatives. The scrappage scheme\u00a0is open for taxis and hackneys reaching their maximum permissible age limit in 2020\/21. Up to &euro;20,000\u00a0is available for eligible drivers switching to a new all-electric vehicle and up to &euro;32,500 for those moving to a wheelchair accessible full electric vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  As a further measure to support the SPSV sector's transition to low emissions, dedicated charging infrastructure for EV taxis is currently being developed across the country. Last year, my Department funded installation of SPSV-dedicated EV charging infrastructure at Dublin and Cork airports, as well as at Heuston, Kent and Colbert train stations.\u00a0 My Department will support further installations for SPSV charging at key transport hubs in 2021. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally-friendly means of charging, especially when using night-rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.\u00a0 The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger, up to a maximum of &euro;600. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Currently, work is being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks).\u00a0There are a number of complex planning issues to address to expand the grant in this way and the Department and the SEAI are working to address the issues involved.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with key stakeholders, including local government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes helping to develop appropriate guidance for local authorities to facilitate\u00a0the expansion of the national public charging network using the supports available. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that\u00a0the Programme for Government published in June last year, commits to\u00a0publishing an\u00a0electric\u00a0vehicle\u00a0infrastructure strategy. Once completed, the\u00a0strategy\u00a0will provide a key framework for ensuring sufficient infrastructure to keep ahead of\u00a0demand.

of supports for businesses, including the Aviation sector. These supports include the\u00a0wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates,\u00a0deferral of\u00a0tax liabilities, the\u00a0COVID Restrictions\u00a0Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021. Irish airlines and airports have availed of over &euro;200 million through these supports to date. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As regards supports specifically targeted at\u00a0the protection of employment, the Employment Wage Subsidy Schemes (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment amid these very challenging times and has been extended to the end of June 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically\u00a0 for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure; an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of &euro;1.8 million per beneficiary; and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies. The aid will take the form of direct grants and airports will be invited to apply for funding under this Scheme shortly.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and to make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. It cannot be excluded that further targeted supports\u00a0may be required later in 2021, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout the forthcoming summer season.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis. On 5\u00a0 March,\u00a0Minister Ryan and Minister Naughton chaired a special meeting of the Steering Committee of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum . A sub-group of the NCADF, specifically tasked with developing an Aviation Restart Plan at the meeting on 5 March, submitted a report dated 14 April with proposals that they believe will best provide for the restart and recovery of the aviation sector in Ireland. My department has written to the NCADF seeking additional information and clarity on the operational readiness of the sector regarding a resumption of international travel, including detail on how passengers will travel through our airports in a safe and COVID-19 compliant manner. I am reviewing this report and its proposals, and will also engage with other\u00a0ministers and Government as required.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, an aviation sub-group has also been charged with looking at the needs of the aviation sector in Ireland in the context of the impact of COVID-19. This sub-group, which I chair,\u00a0is attended by delegations from labour and employer representative bodies.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy. It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we are committed to\u00a0progressing the work that will allow\u00a0the sector\u00a0to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800088#WRK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":497,"content":"<p>Question No. 234 answered with Question No. 193.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Transport Authority","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800088#WRK03700"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[21679\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800088#WRK03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when the review of extra National Transport Authority staff being allocated to local authorities in relation to active travel will conclude and a decision be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>As Minister for\u00a0Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public and sustainable transport.

Taxi and other small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators, who are particularly dependent on the hospitality and tourism sectors, have faced a particularly pronounced drop in demand for their services. <\/p>  <p>  It is in recognition of these difficulties that the Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports with broad eligibility criteria for individuals and businesses which have been adversely affected by COVID-19. Many of these supports can be accessed by self-employed taxi drivers including liquidity and investment measures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Enterprise Support Grant and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) from the Department of Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  Self-employed recipients of the PUP, which includes\u00a0many\u00a0SPSV drivers, can also avail of the Self-Employment Income Scheme which provides for an income disregard for the first &euro;960 earned in a given 8-week period. Individuals exiting the PUP may also avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant, a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 which can be used towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV towards zero\/low-emission vehicles and I have increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme from &euro;1 million in 2020 to &euro;15 million in 2021. Furthermore, in view of the particular challenges faced by operators of older vehicles, I have doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. Additional amounts are available for those switching to vehicles which are both electric and wheelchair accessible. \u00a0There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme since its launch in February with over\u00a0400 applications received to date.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to access to bus lanes, the Deputy may wish to be aware that there are no plans to change the present arrangement whereby taxis can access bus lanes during their course of business.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has not exercised quantitative controls on taxi licences for nearly two decades. The consequences of such quantitative controls in the past were that passengers routinely endured lengthy queues for taxis at ranks. Dublin in particular suffered from a chronic undersupply of taxis. A moratorium on the issuance of licences would not serve the interests of those who use taxis and I do not support it. There are no plans to reintroduce such controls. Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t believe a moratorium would, in any event, address the core concerns of taxi drivers, noting that licence applications are just a fraction of what they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Age limits for taxis and hackneys are a matter for the NTA as statutory regulator. I can confirm, however, that the NTA has extended age limits for taxis twice since the start of the pandemic. Following an initial extension in March 2020, last December, following public consultation, the NTA extended them further to the end of 2021. I trust that the NTA will keep this issue under active review as the pandemic progresses.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, which is established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, enjoys a broad membership with members representing driver interests, dispatch operators, passenger interests, and official stakeholders such as local Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

While I have regard for the circumstances in question, as the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment on individual cases. Furthermore, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or groups. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that firms will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor cover and what terms to apply. For example, factors may include inter alia the driver&rsquo;s age; relevant driving experience; the age and type of vehicle; how and where the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; and the storage location. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. In the case of hackney or taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the business, which involves extensive driving for hire or reward, and that in their view, this has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result.<\/p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy may be aware, under the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA), which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide cover to an individual seeking motor insurance if they have approached at least three insurers and have not been able to obtain cover from them. I would note that the number of taxi and hackney drivers utilising the DCA fell from 375 in 2016 to 205 in 2019, and to just 24 in 2020. While the numbers for 2020 are likely to have decreased in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall downward trend suggests increased stability in the market and greater availability of insurance for drivers.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government, as reflected in the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. In this regard, work is ongoing to deliver further key reforms over the coming months, which I believe will go some way to improving both the cost and availability of insurance for consumers, businesses and community groups. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the individual concerned to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, including motor insurance.

The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.

No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees.

Apart from portability, a PRSA potentially has more flexible features than a PEPP, means that the PEPP is unlikely to be more attractive to domestic consumers.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply.  These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule.  In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  While the above applies in general, I am aware of reports that some customers, including those with Type-1 diabetes, have experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining life insurance or mortgage protection cover in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This is an issue that Minister of State Fleming and my officials have raised in meetings with Insurance Ireland, and more recently with the CEOs of the main insurers in the Irish market.  Insurance Ireland stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, such as Type 1 diabetes, will be taken into account by underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19.  It will continue to keep in close contact with its members on this issue, which I welcome.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that both Minister of State Fleming and I have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19, we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800090#WRM04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800090#WRM04300"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[21578\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800090#WRM04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of help-to-buy grant applications received; the number of applications that reached claim stage; and the number of claims approved under the help-to-buy scheme for quarter 1 of 2021.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":615,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that detailed monthly statistics are published on the Help to Buy (HTB) scheme, available at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/statistics\/tax-expenditures\/htb\/htb-monthly.aspx.<\/p><p>These statistics include the numbers of applications and claims.

The Minister of State in my Department, Sean Fleming TD, has credit unions as part of his remit.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While\u00a0recent high profile\u00a0departures from the banking sector that the Deputy references are disappointing, they do present an opportunity for credit unions to grow.\u00a0To that end, Minister Fleming met with both the Irish League of Credit Unions\u00a0(ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA)\u00a0in recent months to\u00a0discuss their respective members'\u00a0strategies\u00a0as a result of the changing landscape.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of commitments set out in Programme for Government, including a review of the policy framework in which credit unions operate. As part of the review, the Department has held extensive engagement with the credit union representative bodies since September 2020 to seek feedback on their key priorities for the sector. In addition, the Department is taking into account work already completed by the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC). <\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that credit unions are co-operative financial institutions owned and controlled by their members. Each credit union has a common bond that establishes the basis for membership (e.g. members within a community or a workplace) and credit unions can\u00a0offer services to members that are within their common bond. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the services \/products that credit unions can and already do provide, the Deputy may be interested in the following:<\/p>  <p>  Review of Lending and Investment Regulations<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has in recent years\u00a0completed reviews of both the lending and investment frameworks to ensure that credit unions operate under a framework that is both tailored and proportionate, to reflect the unique nature of the sector, and to provide flexibility for credit unions who have ambitions to grow.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following introduction of the new lending regulations on 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to approximately &euro;1.1 billion in SME and mortgage loans, with further additional lending capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As at December 2020, credit unions had\u00a0a combined mortgage and SME loan book of\u00a0circa &euro;344 million, an increase of 12% year-on-year. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The revised investment regulations took effect on 1 March 2018. Under these regulations, credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including accounts in authorised credit institutions, certain bank and corporate bonds, sovereign bonds and investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to provide social housing.<\/p>  <p>  SME Lending<\/p>  <p>  Nineteen credit unions, supported by ILCU, CUDA and Metamo, have been approved by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. With their local knowledge, credit unions are ideally placed to support the recovery and providing loans to local businesses is a key element of the recovery. The further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also have the additional benefit of assisting credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book.<\/p>  <p>  Access to Finance for Retrofit<\/p>  <p>  The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in Budget 2021. My officials have been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communication, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to support increased credit union participation in green retrofit loan schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Investment in Approved Housing Bodies<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 May 2018 it has been possible for credit unions to invest in Approved Housing Bodies through a regulated vehicle.

As such, this is included within the\u00a0Action Plan for Insurance Reform. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming and I have had extensive engagement with motor insurers and other key policy stakeholders throughout the pandemic. We have consistently called on insurers to: treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally, and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code; emphasised the need for industry to respond to both the Government&rsquo;s ongoing reforms and the pandemic by lowering premiums; continuing to offer forbearance measures; and expanding its risk horizon in the market (such as providing more cover for younger drivers). \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Minister of State Fleming met with the CEOs of the main insurance firms in the last number of weeks.\u00a0 He outlined that Government is continuing to implement measures from the\u00a0Action Plan for Insurance Reform, and that the new Personal Injuries Guidelines were coming into force ahead of schedule, on 24 April. This key development will be of major benefit to insurers as it will help reduce the cost of claims, as well as allow the expansion of their business on the basis of greater confidence around more sustainable and consistent award levels. He also outlined that on renewal Government expects premiums should reduce for all classes of insurance and insurers should consider increasing their risk appetite and proactively identify market opportunities where coverage gaps currently exist. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The issue of COVID-19 forbearance measures was on the agenda for these meetings, and I understand that a number of firms indicated that they will also take account of COVID-19 restrictions when setting premiums.

Revenue&rsquo;s interventions range from non-audit compliance interventions such as assurance checks, aspect queries and profile interviews to audit or investigations.

Any person convicted on indictment of an offence under section 1078 is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970 or, at the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.

Our Fourth Irish Language Scheme 2021-2024 is currently in the final stages of preparation before being confirmed by the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media as per section 14 of the Official Languages Act 2003.\u00a0My Department is committed to providing quality services to its customers in Irish and\/or bilingually including written correspondence, oral announcements\/telephone communication with the public, speeches, public meetings, media communications, official invitations, service to Gaeltacht areas and publications.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has Customer Feedback Forms available to visitors in both Irish and English. These forms are not published online and are not emailed out, however, under the Customer Service charter available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the customer services email address is available so that matters can be raised directly, if required. My Department&rsquo;s Subject Access Request form, which is provided in line with Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is also available in both Irish and English on the website.<\/p>  <p>  The following is the position for each of the bodies under\u00a0the aegis of my Department in relation to facilitating persons wishing to engage with their services through the Irish language:<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank's Language Scheme 2019-2022 is available on its website and is also\u00a0available on the\u00a0Bank&rsquo;s Irish website. Under the Language Scheme, the Bank has a number of measures in place to facilitate individuals who wish to engage through Irish, including availability of an Irish speaker to carry out banking transactions at the Bank&rsquo;s Teller Service, a public contacts helpline, consumers being able to exercise any rights under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 through Irish and being able to complete the process to request a credit report, amendment, or explanatory statement and make a notice of suspected impersonation in Irish. All of its forms with a public-facing dimension are available in both Irish and English on the Bank&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has arrangements in place to ensure that its services are provided through Irish when requested and\u00a0its complaint form is available in both Irish and English. The FSPO also uses a form for the purposes of facilitating Data Access Requests &ndash; this form is in the process of being translated into Irish. <\/p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) has arrangements in place, in conjunction with the National Treasury Management Agency which provides facilities and ICT support to HBFI, in order to facilitate persons wishing to engage with their services through Irish. I am informed that HBFI does not currently have any forms available to the general public in Irish, however, where a member of the public communicates with HBFI in an official language, HBFI will reply in the same language.<\/p>  <p>  As a small organisation of six staff, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council facilitates persons wishing to engage with their services through Irish on an ad-hoc basis. The Fiscal Council does not have any forms available for public use. <\/p>  <p>  Any appeal or application addressed\u00a0to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal in Irish will be processed, heard and judged in that language at an Applicant&rsquo;s request. Given the complex and technical nature of the subject matter of the disputes heard by the Tribunal, where necessary, they will engage the services of suitably qualified translators\/interpreters for the translation of any technical documentation. Its forms are available in both English and Irish, and the Irish language forms will be supplied to any Applicant on request.<\/p>  <p>  While the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) does not provide services directly to the public, there are three functions it performs in which the public may have an interest; Dormant Accounts, Eligible Liabilities Guarantee\u00a0Scheme and State Savings. There are employees available to communicate with callers through Irish if required. An email address is in place to facilitate the submission of queries from the general public in Irish. State Savings are the Government savings products the NTMA offers through An Post and the Prize Bond Company to personal savers. Documentation relating to the products are available in Irish via the State Savings website. With regard to forms available to the public, An Post (acting as an agent for the NTMA in respect of State Savings) has committed to making all standard forms available in digital form on the Internet in Irish. Acting as the State Claims Agency, the NTMA also manages personal injury, property damage and clinical negligence claims brought against certain State authorities. The NTMA can provide any forms requested by any of its Delegated State Authorities in either of the Official Languages.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has little direct contact with the general public. The Office publishes a number of documents on its website bilingually in line with its Irish Language Scheme. Its website is available bilingually,\u00a0with a navigational link from each page on the English version to the relevant page in the Irish version. Phone calls are answered bilingually, in Irish first. The choice of language of the customer is established and they are directed to the appropriate official. The Office provides a dedicated e-mail address to facilitate those who wish to communicate with the Office in Irish. The Office does not have any forms available to the public.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners offers a comprehensive range of services to individuals and businesses that wish to conduct their affairs in Irish. The onus is on the individuals and businesses concerned to advise Revenue that they wish to communicate through Irish. Information regarding Revenue&rsquo;s Irish Language Scheme can be found on its website. All Revenue publications, forms and leaflets are available in Irish on its website. <\/p>  <p>  While the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has limited services delivered to the public, they have arrangements in place, in conjunction with the NTMA which provides its\u00a0facilities and ICT support, in order to facilitate persons wishing to engage with their services through Irish. The SBCI does not have any forms available in Irish to the general public.<\/p>  <p>  Any correspondence received by the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) in Irish is responded to in Irish. All publications are published simultaneously in Irish and English on its website which is currently being developed to provide Irish translations of each area. The Commission also has two staff members capable of providing services in Irish. It has three standard forms which are currently being translated into Irish. <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee is not a State agency, rather it is a committee set up to advise the Minister for Finance on credit union issues. <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Restructuring Board concluded its restructuring work and was operationally wound down in 2017; it is currently awaiting formal dissolution. <\/p>  <p>  The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal\u00a0does not have obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003.\u00a0It operates through The National Rehabilitation Hospital which provides clinical facilities and staffing. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation is in liquidation and does not provide services to the public. <\/p>  <p>  The Investor Compensation Company DAC does not provide services to the public generally and is not subject to the Official Languages Act, 2003. <\/p>  <p>  The National Asset Management Agency does not provide services to the general public.<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office is not a public body, and as such does not have obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003.

As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;25 million is being made available under the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021.  This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians and the valuable insights gained. This new scheme is aimed at commercial venues, producers and promoters in the culture sector and will support employment and well-being opportunities across all genres and continued high quality artistic output for the general public. Over 400 applications have been received seeking grants of &euro;80m. Assessment of applications to the scheme are currently underway. <\/p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million will also be made available to local authorities for outdoor live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances and seek to engage as diverse a range of performers as possible. The administrative arrangements and requirements for this scheme are being finalised and further details will be announced in due course.<\/p>  <p>  As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply.

There are no outstanding applications under the LASPP.<\/p><p>Exchequer support for any new swimming pool projects is now being provided under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF).  The LSSIF was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects including swimming pools with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027. Provisional grants to 8 swimming pool projects under the LSSIF were awarded in January 2020. Those projects are now at various stages of a due diligence process. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF Programme which is expected to be complete in the coming months. This review will consider, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and whether any additional grants should be awarded. The timing of any new call for proposals will also be considered. Any new allocations or a new call for proposals will be dependent on receiving additional funding for the LSSIF following the completion of the review of the National Development Plan.<\/p><p>My Department does not have the requested information in relation to public swimming pools which are closed for reasons unrelated to the current Covid-19 restrictions and the rationale for these closures. The Department's direct role is to provide capital support for the construction of some of these pools and the Department has no role in the day-to-day running of these facilities. .<\/p><p>In relation to future needs, the National Sports Policy 2018 -2027 (NSP), launched on 25 July 2018, commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. This will involve close collaboration with relevant Government Departments, Local Authorities, sporting bodies and other stakeholders. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, a Sport Action Plan, covering the period to end 2023 is nearing completion and will be published shortly. It is envisaged that the development of a national swimming strategy will be significantly progressed as a priority action in the early stages of that Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800094#WRQ06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Sector","counter":849,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800095#WRR00600"},{"type":"question","counter":850,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[21633\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800095#WRR00700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her Department has carried out an analysis into the increasing number of gambling adverts on television; if she has considered introducing restrictions in this area to protect the public good; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":851,"content":"<p>The Minister for Justice has policy responsibility for the regulation of gambling and for the establishment of a new Gambling Regulator. <\/p><p>At present, the regulation of broadcast gambling advertising is an operational matter for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and is not part of my functions as Minister. <\/p><p>The current rules around gambling advertising on broadcasting services are contained in the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s General Commercial Communications Code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800095#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":852,"content":"<p>Question No. 360 answered with Question No. 333.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800095#WRR01000"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[21665\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800095#WRR01100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the breakdown of the &euro;12 million allocation under the weatherproofing and outdoor dining infrastructure scheme; the way in which the funding available in excess of &euro;200,000 per local authority will be spent; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>The development and administration of the Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.

The funding was allocated in the form of a grant scheme, open to the 69 licensed establishments in Ireland.  This was aimed primarily at preventing an animal welfare crisis as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.  Of the total amount of &euro;1.6 million, a fund of &euro;500,000 was available to assist small and medium sized zoos and aquaria.  This financial support from my colleagues recognised the vital role played by our zoos and aquaria as networks for global conservation of biodiversity, as centres of learning and places where lifelong memories of families and children are made.  This emergency funding will also safeguard employment and stimulate local economies in recovering by ensuring the continued operation of viable zoo establishments throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for Tourism, I am committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery and I continue to engage with bodies representing the visitor attractions sector.

Working collaboratively, the Creative Ireland Programme has focused on supporting both direct engagement with creativity (e.g., in education, institutions, industry, and communities) as well as creativity as a way of engaging with broader societal issues (e.g., mental health, social marginalisation, rural isolation, poverty, isolation of the aged, individuals with disabilities or special needs, migrant integration, intercultural dialogue, climate action, biodiversity loss).<\/p><p>The evidence that climate change and the interrelated challenge of biodiversity loss are happening now is compelling. The urgent need for climate action must be addressed both individually and collectively. The Programme for Government commits to an ambitious reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The increased scale and depth of this ambition cannot be addressed through policy and technology alone. A concerted mobilisation of every element of Irish society through sustained engagement is required. To that end, the Programme for Government recognises the need to work in partnership with communities and to further develop the role and deploy the experience of the cultural and creative sectors with a commitment to &ldquo;Support Creative Ireland in engaging the public on climate change through the creative and cultural sectors initiative.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In 2019, the Creative Ireland Programme in partnership with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment commissioned a report Engaging the Public on Climate Change through the Cultural and Creative Sectors.

Across both strands, the Creative Climate Action Fund is seeking:<\/p><p>- Responses of creative or interpretive expression (whether traditional or contemporary) from across the arts, cultural and creative sectors.<\/p><p>- Projects that can meaningfully connect people and communities with the profound changes that are happening as a result of climate change, and can transform that connection into climate action and behaviour change.<\/p><p>- Interdisciplinary and collaborative ways of working which bring together creative practitioners with different disciplines, e.g., science, urban planning, engineering, and technology with thought-leaders, activists, academics and others.<\/p><p>- Initiatives that demonstrate impact and have considered evaluation in order to move beyond raising awareness of climate change, and discuss, encourage, and facilitate system, lifestyle and behaviour changes.<\/p><p>- Innovative delivery using artistic and creative ways to encourage ideas that are transformative, moving, challenging and thought provoking and promote alternative ways of thinking and acting.<\/p><p>- Not only deepened participation, but a widening reach to connect with diverse audiences and communities spanning urban and rural, ages and cultures reflecting a scheme that is inclusive, ensuring nobody is left behind as a result of climate action. <\/p><p>- Initiatives that have the potential for scale and aim for longevity, making the best use of platforms and  focusing on wider participation and engagement, longer term movements and campaigns.<\/p><p>Sustained climate action requires a combined commitment and cooperation across society, in recognition that the causes, and impacts of climate change are experienced on both a global scale and an individual scale. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800096#WRS04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":927,"content":"<p>Question No. 389 answered with Question No. 338.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800096#WRS04400"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[22041\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800096#WRS04500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the engagement her Department has had regarding a possible successor to the stay and spend incentive; if engagement has taken place with representative organisations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":930,"content":"<p>The Stay and Spend scheme was set up late last summer to stimulate demand for accommodation and hospitality businesses during the off season.

Self-employed businesses whether sole traders, partnerships and incorporated entities operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;5m will be allocated by my Department\u00a0to local authorities to facilitate programming of outdoor live performances in summer 2021 animating town centres for local communities, should public health considerations permit.  It will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.<\/p>  <p>  A separate &euro;5m is being made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector. This will be applied to supporting the installation of high quality recording and streaming facilities in venues through a competitive grant application process.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;1 million was allocated for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival 2021 to support the employment of performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021  curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations that will be broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel over six days and nights, marking the national day.<\/p>  <p>  Through Culture Ireland's programmes my Department continues to promote Irish arts abroad. These include a regular grant round programme which operates on the basis of 5 grant rounds per year\u00a0and currently supports online presentation of Irish artists globally. <\/p>  <p>  Culture Ireland also continues to operate its showcase programme, designed to generate further opportunities for Irish artists by supporting the presentation of their work to international programmers. <\/p>  <p>  Recent activity includes the digital showcasing of \u00a011 Irish bands as part of the Music from Ireland Showcase at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas in 18 &ndash; 19 March. Upcoming is The Great Escape, (usually an in-person event in Brighton, GB) from 13 &ndash; 15 May where five recorded performances will be showcased online.<\/p>  <p>  Culture Ireland for the first time ever curated an online 5 day festival running from 17-21 March which\u00a0was designed to celebrate Irish arts worldwide at a time when Irish artists normally travel the globe, presenting and sharing our culture on international stages.\u00a0The festival, entitled SEODA, was an ambitious programme to ensure Irish artists reached audiences worldwide, including the diaspora and new audiences where Irish artists may not have travelled previously. The festival\u00a0was also available free online in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800098#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sport and Recreational Development","counter":1002,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800098#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1003,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[22334\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800098#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which she expects the reopening of the sporting sector in the event of controlling Covid-19, having particular regard to the need for a special effort in the circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":1004,"content":"<p>The issue of the further reopening of the sports sector will be a matter for decision by the Government.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has published the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021 &ndash; The Path Ahead and has in that context agreed that the public health restrictions will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. <\/p>  <p>  Any easing of measures should be slow and gradual with sufficient time between phases to assess impact and to respond if the epidemiological situation was to deteriorate.

Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child subject to no maximum.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.

(Application Reference Number FS007029). Similar licences have been recently granted to Codling and SSE (Braymore point) for site investigation works on the east coast. Full details of the licence applications and the material upon which decisions were based are available to view on my Department's website.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As part of the consideration of these foreshore licence applications, input was sought from a number of expert prescribed bodies such as such as the Marine Institute, Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and Inland Fisheries Ireland, among several others. The observations of these bodies were considered as part of the overall assessment of the projects and they informed some of the specific conditions which were attached to the licences granted in these cases. The licence applications were\u00a0also subjected to a thorough environmental assessment as well as a public interest test which considered the wider implications of allowing the site investigation works on the Foreshore to proceed.<\/p><p>In addition, a public consultation was held on the Foreshore licence applications which gave the public an opportunity to lodge any observations or objections they had to the proposed site investigation works. The submissions received from the public along with the responses to these from the applicants were fully considered in making a decision on the licence applications. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government established a 2030 ambition of 5GW from offshore renewable energy (ORE) sources for the East Coast area, which, at peak production, would be sufficient to meet the State&rsquo;s current peak electrical demand, significantly contributing to our 2030 target of 70% renewable electricity. My Department is currently in the process of finalising the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) which provides a long-term framework for effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources. The NMPF is intended to enable Government to set a clear direction for managing our seas, clarify objectives and priorities, and direct decision makers, users and stakeholders towards more strategic, plan-led and efficient use of marine resources. Under this framework, proposals that assist the State in meeting the Government&rsquo;s 2030 ORE targets and proposals that maximise the long-term shift from use of fossil fuels to renewable electricity, in line with decarbonisation targets, should be supported.<\/p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the issue of diverse levels and standards of communications between the fisheries and ORE industries, having first been raised by members of the fisheries community at a National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) public consultation meeting in Arklow held on 10 February 2020, which was one of a number of NMPF public consultation events held by the Marine Planning Policy and Legislation (MPPL) team across 2019 and early 2020. To address these concerns, and to promote constructive engagement and consultation between the fisheries community and the ORE industry, my Department intends to commence the formation of a Seafood and ORE working group, with the initial aim of agreeing a communications protocol between these two strategically important Marine sectors. Consultations on the draft terms of reference are ongoing between my Department, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and other relevant public sector bodies. These consultations are expected to be finalised shortly. <\/p><p>While the initial focus of the proposed group will be to formalise a consultation\/engagement process between the\u00a0two industries, it is the intention of my Department, that in the longer term, the Seafood\/ORE group address a number of issues that impact fishers, including the impact of developments (including exploration of development sites) dislocation, and co-existence.

It provides a balanced range of activities for children through the six strands, of which Aquatics is one.\u00a0 The aquatics programme is concerned with gaining competence and confidence near, in, under and on water. The term &lsquo;aquatics&rsquo; is used to include not only the teaching of swimming strokes but the provision of opportunities for enjoyment of water play and other aspects of aquatics. The concern for water safety permeates all aquatic activities. However, the PE curriculum has been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary. Consequently, it offers a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Currently,\u00a0 the primary curriculum is undergoing a period of review and redevelopment led by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The new draft Primary Curriculum Framework was published in 2020 for public consultation. Phase one of the consultation ended in December 2020 and phase two, which will focus on consulting with school leaders, teachers, children and parents will commence in September 2021. This consultation will inform the direction of the new primary curriculum, with the completed draft framework expected to be published in Q2 2022 and the specifications for the curricular areas, including physical education, to be developed in the following years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800105#WRBB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1403,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[21531\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800105#WRBB05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of secondary schools which do not provide swimming lessons to students in each local authority in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1404,"content":"<p>The Department of Education does not have access to the information on the number of post primary schools which do not provide swimming lessons in each local authority.

In the Physical Activity area &lsquo;Aquatics&rsquo; students learn about water-based activities that utilise swimming and\/or diving skills and techniques for performance water safety, or recreational purposes.

The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities at this time. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  A whole-school team approach is recommended in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  From the outset of this pandemic NEPS has continued to deliver a psychological service to schools within the context of public health advice. In addition, NEPS has remained proactive in the development of advice for schools, parents and pupils to support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists have an increased focus on both consultation and casework in schools with particular attention to the needs of individual students.  Psychologists are taking a blended approach to the provision of casework to schools, working both remotely, and where appropriate in-school, depending on school protocols\/plans and of the nature of need. <\/p>  <p>  NEPS is developing a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which includes trauma informed approaches.  The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools.

Following the pilot a national roll-out is planned during the next academic year.   <\/p>  <p>  Restorative Practice is an evidence-based anti-bullying intervention and prevention strategy that is designed to help build understanding, encourage accountability and provide opportunities for healing. Schools that adopt Restorative Practice on a whole-school basis consistently demonstrate a variety of benefits in terms of both school management and student engagement. Restorative Practice supports are available to schools from the PDST Wellbeing Teams. Schools who are considering embedding Restorative Practice can avail of a once-off introductory session outlining the principles and processes of the approach, while schools who have already engaged in the process of Restorative Practice in their school can avail of follow-up in-school support visits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800106#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","counter":1433,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800106#WRCC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1434,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[21743\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800106#WRCC03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when there will be a full review of the irregularities in relation to the allocation of resources for two schools (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1494","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1435,"content":"<p>A detailed analysis of school enrolment data\u00a0and the latest data available from Census 2016, using the HP Deprivation Index, has been\u00a0carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group.\u00a0 My Department\u00a0has commenced a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspects and implementation of the model, and work is ongoing on final elements of the model.

It recognises and supports pupils&rsquo; engagement with Irish and English at different stages and rates along their language-learning journey. It builds on the language knowledge and experience that pupils bring to the school and recognises that pupils will be at various stages. Schools cater for a wide diversity of needs by providing a differentiated learning experience for pupils in an inclusive school environment for both Irish and English. This is informed by the benefits of bilingualism for all pupils, as well as the principles of inclusion that underpin the Primary Language Curriculum. All pupils should be encouraged to study Irish and achieve a level of personal proficiency that is appropriate to their own personal needs and ability.<\/p><p>The Progression Continua in the Primary Language Curriculum provide a framework for teachers to identify the pupil&rsquo;s stage of language development and to plan interventions that support the development of language skills and competences in Irish and in English in an integrated manner, emphasising the transferability of language skills across languages. Differentiation is a way of teaching in which teachers proactively modify curriculum, teaching methods, resources and learning activities in line with the identified needs of an individual and\/or small groups of learners to maximize the learning opportunity for each learner in the classroom. The aim of differentiation is to ensure that each pupil can engage in purposeful and meaningful learning activities and to increase their motivation and enjoyment in order to support them in engaging with increasingly challenging tasks over time tasks over time. Teachers adapt teaching activities and resources in order that they build on the pupil&rsquo;s identified strengths in response to need.

The Council's work has informed the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023, the development of the Automatic Enrolment Programme and the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG). <\/p><p>At my request, the Pensions Council is currently considering the merits of introducing an initiative similar to the Cost Transparency Initiative in the UK for pension providers in Ireland and has been asked to consider whether such an approach is effective on a voluntary basis, as in the UK, or operates better on a mandatory basis, such as in Denmark and in the Netherlands.<\/p><p>The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 - 2023 highlights the very large number of private pension schemes in Ireland and how this is a contributing factor in the level of professional fees charged to these schemes both for administration and investment advice.\u00a0 It sets out a phased approach to reforming the pensions market, especially with respect to the\u00a0rationalisation of pension schemes\u00a0which it is anticipated will contribute considerably to lower pension costs and charges in the future.\u00a0 For example, there are approximately 160,000 schemes on the Pension Authority&rsquo;s Register including occupational schemes, AVC schemes, Trust RACs and Death Benefit Only schemes.\u00a0 The consolidation of small DC schemes and single member schemes into larger schemes (including into master trusts) will be a key driver of change with regards to scheme governance and achieving economies of scale in the Irish pensions market.\u00a0 It should also result in considerably reduced administrative costs for such schemes.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Pension Charges in Ireland Report (2012) stated that &quot;the proposed introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees may be the most effective way to introduce change and could have a major impact in reducing charges, particularly for those people with small pension funds and reduced pension expectations. International experience has shown that this type of scheme is extremely successful in providing a simplified and lower cost charging structure and a consistent application across employers.&quot;\u00a0<\/p><p>In line with the Roadmap for Pension Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023, the Government has committed to develop and introduce an &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; (AE) supplementary retirement savings system.\u00a0 My Department is currently working on design proposals for such a system.\u00a0 The Programme for Government further\u00a0commits that there will be a charges cap imposed on AE providers. \u00a0<\/p><p>I recently signed the Regulations to transpose the IORPS II Directive into Irish law.\u00a0 Alongside the many reforms introduced by the Directive in the area of pension scheme governance, the Directive also provides for additional disclosure requirements in respect of fees and charges.\u00a0\u00a0Pension Schemes are now required to draw up a clear and comprehensive Pension Benefit Statement for members containing &ldquo;a breakdown of the costs deducted by the scheme or trust RAC at least over the last 12 months&rdquo; and &ldquo;written in a clear manner, using clear, succinct and comprehensible language, avoiding the use of jargon and avoiding technical terms where everyday words can be used instead.&rdquo;\u00a0<\/p><p>The Interdepartmental Pensions Reform &amp;amp; Taxation Group (IDPRTG) published its Report on Supplementary Pensions in November 2020.The report presented a number of recommendations to help advance the goal of simplifying and harmonising the supplementary pension landscape which will reduce complexity, enhance market competitiveness, drive product efficiencies and in turn lead to better retirement outcomes for pension savers.\u00a0 An implementation group is actively working on the IDPRTG Report&rsquo;s recommendations.\u00a0<\/p><p>It is acknowledged that improving the transparency of pension costs, rationalising the pensions market and improving scheme governance will drive price competition and lead to better outcomes for consumers.\u00a0 My Department continues to progress several key initiatives which will help to achieve this.\u00a0<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800110#WRGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":1622,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800110#WRGG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1623,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[21444\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800110#WRGG01300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the support and incentives available to part-time employees currently receiving the pandemic unemployment payment who are transitioning back into the workforce; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1624,"content":"<p>The onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and resulting\u00a0public health measures, has greatly impacted economic activity in the State and the labour market. The latest CSO data for March 2021, recorded a COVID-19 adjusted overall unemployment rate of 24.2 percent, with an equivalent measure for youth at 59.2 percent.<\/p><p>Research conducted by my Department last year suggests that part-time workers may have been particularly impacted in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, given their tendency to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic; namely accommodation and food, and retail.<\/p><p>While many have been displaced from their employment by the pandemic, most of those currently in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will return to employment as restrictions ease and the economy re-opens. However, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost, and\u00a0additional numbers\u00a0of persons\u00a0will require State support to find new jobs transitioning back to work.<\/p><p>I am acutely aware that when people lose their jobs and remain unemployed for some time they can become disconnected from the labour market. These individuals risk losing the vital social and work connections that are needed to identify and pursue work opportunities and for many it may be the case that their existing work experience and skills cannot easily translate into new sectors of\u00a0employment. This can particularly be the case for part-time employees.<\/p><p>Therefore, my Department is supporting initiatives to assist people, including part-time workers, get back to work, once COVID-19 restrictions and their impact on the economy and labour market begin to ease. <\/p><p>Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place the following measures:<\/p><p>- Expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months). Time spent in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment can be counted for the purposes of eligibility for all unemployed individuals.<\/p><p>- nFacilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.<\/p><p>- Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.<\/p><p>- Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.<\/p><p>- Increasing the funding available to all PUP recipients through the Training Support Grant from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000. The grant is designed to support quick access to short-term training where the training is not delivered by a State provider.<\/p><p>My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage\u00a0businesses to provide jobseekers, including part-time workers, with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market\u00a0and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. I expect to launch the Programme as soon as public health restrictions allow in 2021.<\/p><p>Those\u00a0in self-employment, looking to reopen their business,\u00a0may\u00a0have other income support options available to them from my Department depending on their circumstances.\u00a0A self-employed person can retain their PUP where their income from self-employment does not exceed &euro;960 over a rolling 8-week period and they continue to meet the scheme conditions. <\/p><p>Where a person exceeds this\u00a0threshold and is engaging in regular limited self-employment, access to the Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) has been extended to those who transition from the PUP.\u00a0 Under this scheme, a self-employed recipient can engage in self-employment for up to 24 hours\u00a0per week\u00a0and retain a personal weekly rate of payment of &euro;128.60. A self-employed jobseeker with a qualified adult can be paid &euro;209.70 per week.\u00a0Moreover, there is no earnings limit to receive the payment.\u00a0<\/p><p>These efforts designed to support those displaced by COVID-19, including part-time workers, will be further bolstered by Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department.\u00a0Pathways to Work is\u00a0the Government&rsquo;s national employment services strategy.\u00a0It will set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market.\u00a0Publication is expected in the coming months, following the launch of the Government's Economic Recovery Plan.\u00a0<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800110#WRGG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":1625,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800110#WRGG01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1626,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[21473\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800110#WRGG01600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will make contact with a centre (details supplied) whose maintenance worker is due to conclude their community employment scheme in coming months and are eager to retain this particular worker but do not have funding and assist them in sourcing funding to retain this person.;

This is because many employers operate a \"last in-first out\" protocol when reducing their labour force. Moreover, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on our youth is driven by the tendency for many younger people to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic; namely accommodation and food and retail.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, seasonally adjusted youth unemployment (15-24 year olds) stood at just over 11% in December 2019. Latest estimates from the CSO however, show that by the end of March 2021, this figure had increased to almost 15%. These estimates exclude those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Including all those in receipt of the PUP gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate is\u00a059.2 % for young people at the end of March.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note a significant\u00a0number of PUP recipients are students. As of end-March 2021, it is estimated that 47,000 PUP recipients are students, with almost 90 percent of these in the under 25 cohort. Using international measures of unemployment, set by the International Labour Organisation, students are generally not counted as unemployed, as they are not considered part of the labour force. Therefore, the inclusion of recipients of PUP, including students, in the COVID-19 Adjusted Measure of youth unemployment\u00a0 artificially inflates this measure.<\/p>  <p>  We know that\u00a0 jobs of many persons currently on PUP will not be permanently lost due to the pandemic. Many will return to previous employment once restrictions ease, as they did during previous easing of restrictions during 2020. However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs. <\/p>  <p>  This is why the European Council believed it was important to reinforce the existing Youth Guarantee to aid in alleviating the labour market impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on young people. This aim is complementary to our objectives in Government.\u00a0 As Minister for Social Protection, I welcomed the Council of the European Union&rsquo;s recommendation of a reinforced Youth Guarantee.<\/p>  <p>  Central to the reinforced programme is the extension of the widening of the youth age bracket to include young people aged 25-29. As part of activation services provided by my Department via Intreo, young people under 25 receive the most intensive engagement. My Department intend to extend this up to age 29, as per the new reinforced Youth Guarantee, and are currently exploring the necessary system changes to allow for this to be put in place.<\/p>  <p>  Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place the following measures to support persons including young persons back to employment:<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres, with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing\u00a0the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people, by expanding the young person rate from under 25 to under 30 years of age. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months).<\/p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.<\/p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.<\/p>  <p>  A core element of the reinforced Youth Guarantee is to support young people in gaining valuable work experience and developing the right skills for a changing world of work. My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage\u00a0businesses provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market\u00a0and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. I expect to launch the Programme as soon as public health restrictions allow in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the reinforced Youth Guarantee notes the value in supporting apprenticeships as a means of training young people and providing stable labour market integration. Last week, my colleague, Minister Harris, launched the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.\u00a0The Action Plan sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025. The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for many young people.<\/p>  <p>  These efforts will be further bolstered by Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department.\u00a0Pathways to Work, is\u00a0the Government&rsquo;s national employment services strategy.\u00a0It will set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market.\u00a0Publication is expected in the coming months, following the launch of the Government's Economic Recovery Plan.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800111#WRHH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":1699,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800111#WRHH03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1700,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[22159\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800111#WRHH03800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the implementation of the pensions auto enrolment system; the expected commencement date for the implementation of the system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1701,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a pension auto-enrolment system.

Therefore, the Government will seek to gradually deliver an AE system, based on the following principles:<\/p><p>- There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contribution made by workers.<\/p><p>- Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up contributions.<\/p><p>- There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.<\/p><p>- Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from.<\/p><p>- There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection continues to work on the design of the AE system.

This is to help ensure that any vulnerabilities that may subsequently arise are identified in a timely manner. <\/p>  <p>  If the vulnerability assessment identifies one or more vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:<\/p>  <p>  - Consider whether the vulnerability identified has implications for the accommodation to be provided to the applicant at the Reception Centre and advise those responsible for assigning accommodation accordingly.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Consider whether the vulnerability identified has implications for the accommodation to be provided to the applicant after they move from the Reception Centre and advise the IPAS dispersal team accordingly. The dispersal team then take the outcome of the Vulnerability Assessment into account when determining where to accommodate the applicant. How this is done is described below at section 12 of this policy.<\/p>  <p>  - Consider whether a further assessment is required and, if we deem that it is, make arrangements for a further assessment to be carried out. Where a follow-up assessment is indicated, the applicant will receive an appointment for this to be carried out at a later date.<\/p>  <p>  - Advise the Health Service Executive (HSE) Care Team in the Reception Centre that the applicant&rsquo;s Vulnerability Assessment has identified one or more vulnerabilities. We do this only so that the HSE Care Team can engage proactively with the applicant to encourage them to avail of the optional health screening offered in the Reception Centre. We do not disclose the nature of the vulnerabilities identified.<\/p>  <p>  As of 21 April 2021,\u00a0306 applicants have entered the vulnerability assessment process with 165 assessments complete and 129 ongoing.\u00a0 So far, 97 applicants have been identified as having some form of vulnerability as defined in the EU Reception Conditions Directive (Recast). It should be noted that not every vulnerability requires special intervention.\u00a0 For example, every child or pregnant woman is identified by default as vulnerable under the Directive whose reception needs are routinely identified during their orientation period at the National Reception Centre in Balseskin.\u00a0\u00a0This would account for approximately\u00a0one third of all applicants detected as vulnerable to date.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the questions used will\u00a0be kept under review during the pilot phase\u00a0and refined to ensure the process continues to\u00a0elicit the best possible information to assist in the assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800113#WRKK04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":1825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800113#WRKK04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1826,"qnumday":716,"qnumall":"[21897\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800113#WRKK05000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the way in which his Department and agencies, under his remit, facilitate persons wishing to engage with services through the Irish language; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1827,"qnumday":717,"qnumall":"[21915\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800113#WRKK05100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if all forms issued by his Department and agencies under his remit are available in both Irish and English; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1828,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 716 and 717 together.<\/p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Official Languages Act 2003 prescribes the categories of\u00a0information which must be published by public bodies, in each of the official languages simultaneously.

Services operating any of the aforementioned programmes would also be eligible to apply for Programme Support Payments.\u00a0 My Department also has a number of strands of sustainability funding which are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal. However, it is not readily feasible at present, to disaggregate the total amounts of funding provided to those childcare providers that are provided by FRCs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It may also be possible for FRCs to access youth funding programmes, from my Department's Youth Affairs Unit. For example funding has been provided to FRCs under the Follow Your Dreams project in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to other agencies under my Department's remit, the majority do not provide funding allocations to FRCs.

Also, Student grant legislation was amended in 2020 to retain the status quo,\u00a0thus allowing funding for eligible students\u00a0attending an approved undergraduate course in the UK to continue post-Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In general, an approved undergraduate course in this context is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU Member State or the UK.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The student grant scheme does not and never has extended to the payment of tuition fees to institutions outside the State, other than for exceptional provision in respect of postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland. This provision is consistent with the principles of the Good Friday agreement and is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding between both jurisdictions.\u00a0 The Scheme also does not extend to PLC courses pursued outside of the State or\u00a0postgraduate study pursued outside of Ireland. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The extension of\u00a0funding in this way would represent a major policy change which has the potential to impose very significant additional costs for the Exchequer. \u00a0Any such decision could only be considered in light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector. Accordingly, at present\u00a0I do not intend\u00a0to depart from the current arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of tuition fees in Ireland, the fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education. <\/p>  <p>  The State currently provides very substantial financial support to undergraduate students in higher education towards the cost of their studies.\u00a0 This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level. <\/p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students attending approves courses in the State with students paying the student contribution. The student contribution applies to all students on an annual basis, who are eligible under for the free fees scheme. The current rate is &euro;3,000 per annum. Currently 60,000 students have all or part of the student contribution paid on their behalf by the State via the Student Grant Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Funding under the Free Fees Initiative is only available in respect of approved courses within the State.<\/p>  <p>  The development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential in light of the centrality of higher education to our progress as a country.

On 21 December 2020, I appointed an advisory panel to assess the application and to furnish a report thereon to the HEA. The advisory panel&rsquo;s report was furnished to the HEA on 12 February 2021. I subsequently received this report along with the views of the HEA on 1 April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 34(1) of the 2018 Act, I am required within 60 days of receiving and considering the advisory panel report, HEA views and information provided, to notify the applicant institutes of my proposed decision on their joint application. I am currently considering all relevant material in the context of my role as decision maker under the 2018 Act and within the requisite legislatively prescribed timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  The creation of new TUs is a key commitment within the Programme for Government and is viewed as a prerequisite for balanced regional development, the retention and attraction of a highly skilled workforce, research capacity building, access to higher education provision and broad socioeconomic progression.<\/p>  <p>  A new multi-campus TU can become a catalyst for enterprise and regional development and increase the academic and regional profile of the unified, integrated higher education institution (HEI) nationally and internationally. The potential benefits of becoming a successful TU are significant in terms of increased higher education access and excellence in teaching and learning, greater critical mass and reach facilitating international recognition, research capacity building, Foreign Direct Investment\u00a0attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experiences and opportunities and broader socioeconomic progression. These benefits should accrue to all campuses across any new multi-campus TU and across the wider hinterland of the university to positively benefit all counties and communities within a region.<\/p>  <p>  Anchored in a multi-campus physical environment, TUs can also provide state-of-the-art learning resources such as libraries, laboratories and e-learning facilities, utilising their solid campus base to support the provision of online and distance learning and widening access to a suite of research informed teaching and learning excellence across all levels of the National Framework of Qualification. As such, TUs can meet the higher education needs of the widest possible range of learners and are legislatively required to have particular regard to the needs of their regions and to provide programmes of education and training that reflects the needs of individuals, business, enterprise, the professions, the community, local interests and other stakeholders in their region.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Government has to date invested heavily in the TU agenda to date with over &euro;65 million invested through higher education landscape and transformation funding since 2013. \u00a0The TU Transformation fund will expend &euro;90 million in total to 2023 with &euro;34.3 million having been allocated in its first tranche last October. In total, over &euro;120 million will have been invested in TU development and progression by 2023.<\/p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the 2019 Technological University Research Network (TURN) report which sets out the blueprint and requirements for successful TUs in the State, is the prioritisation of capital investment in TUs where they are exclusively dependent on Exchequer resourcing.\u00a0 Capital investment has been and will continue to be associated with ongoing TU progression. Currently eleven building projects in the technological sector are being advanced as part of the Higher Education Public Private Partnership (PPP) Programme. These projects will play an important role in enabling projected increases in student enrolments, addressing constraints with regard to existing infrastructure and significantly advancing the TU agenda. The configuration and utilisation of specific campuses in any TU are matters for the individual TU upon establishment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am strongly committed to capital investment capital investment to underpin the ambitions of our higher education institutions including TUs.

Comprised of key stakeholders, this group will work over the coming weeks to develop a plan for returning to onsite tertiary education in the autumn.\u00a0 The working group will work closely with the relevant stakeholder groups and other working groups and will report back to the steering group in May.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Plan will be to:<\/p><p>-  Enable maximum onsite provision of teaching, learning, research and other onsite activities<\/p><p>-  Retain scope for online teaching where necessary<\/p><p>-  Support the ongoing needs of students and learners<\/p><p>-  Ensure coherence and consistency in planning across the sector<\/p><p>-  Support autonomy in the work of institutions and providers in the development of their plans.<\/p><p>The plan will build on the plan which was developed for the academic year 2020\/21 incorporating the experience of 2020\/21 and it will retain the approach of a discretionary framework for institutions to prioritise onsite attendance and enabling phased increases leading to greater levels of onsite provision.<\/p><p>The new plan will continue to prioritise public health and safety and respond to ongoing changes in public health, including the level of vaccination achieved and national public health advice.<\/p><p>Institutions are currently using their own discretion to prioritise on-site attendance for time critical practical learning and to ensure that this is no more than 5% of the student cohort at any one time.\u00a0 As attendance onsite is for time critical purposes, this can change from time to time depending on the subject area and student cohort and this is decided at the discretion of individual institutions.\u00a0 Accordingly, information is not available regarding the number of students being taught online versus those allowed to attend on-campus practical classes by institution in tabular form.<\/p><p>There is ongoing engagement with the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) at a national level through bilateral meetings and their membership of the steering group.\u00a0 USI recently chaired a Student Welfare and Engagement working group which has reported to the steering group on the supports that will be required for students and learners.

All apprentices including those undertaking the new consortia led apprenticeships are excluded from the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  All other general employment legislation applies to apprenticeship as contracts of employment.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the 35 apprenticeships established since 2016, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer.  Neither the Department or any other State agency collect data in relation to apprenticeships wages. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the quality of the apprenticeship experience, the core regulatory standards for apprenticeship provided for in the 1967 Act have been enhanced through statutory rules and administrative guidance. <\/p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Code of Practice which specifies the rights and responsibilities of apprentices and employers and is signed by both parties, forms the basis of each apprenticeship contract.  In tandem with adherence to core regulatory standards, apprenticeships are underpinned by a strong framework of quality assurance to ensure programmes provide a high quality learning experience for apprentices. <\/p>  <p>  Authorised Officers (AOs) provide a critical role in ensuring a high quality on-the-job experience in apprenticeship. AOs approve employers before they can register apprentices, progress the registration of apprentices and provide a point of contact for apprentices in addition to general monitoring of compliance with the Code of Practice. <\/p>  <p>  A review of the application of the quality assurance framework to the craft apprenticeships was completed in December 2020. Building on this, and experience to date, a comprehensive review of the quality assurance, governance arrangements and processes for the existing consortia-led programmes will be undertaken and utilised to inform the development of a robust and future proofed quality assurance system for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 apprentices will be supported to complete their programmes through clearer communication, support networks and increased ownership of their learning journey. The voice of apprentices in shaping the future of the system will be formalised within the single system of apprenticeship, enhancing the existing apprentice feedback mechanism which is inherent in the QQI quality processes. Apprentices will be included both looking to the future through representation on the apprenticeship stakeholder oversight and advisory structures and also through an annual survey of apprentices which will provide a robust system view for the prior year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800117#WROO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2011,"content":"<p>Question No. 784 answered with Question No. 757.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2012,"content":"<p>Question No. 785 answered with Question No. 783.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Training Fund","counter":2013,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800117#WROO02800"},{"type":"question","counter":2014,"qnumday":786,"qnumall":"[22243\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800117#WROO02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1326 of 21 April 2021, the annual and reserve surplus of the NTF by 2025 if expenditure remained stable but excluding Covid-19 emergency spending; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2015,"content":"<p>The National Training Fund (NTF) Act, 2000 provides for a levy on employers to be used to fund the development of and raising of skills amongst those in, or seeking, employment. <\/p><p>The reserve surplus of the NTF by 2025 if expenditure remained stable (excluding Covid emergency spending) is &euro;1.8 billion.

These are companies registered under the Companies Acts, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of such common areas.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to annual service charges, it is a matter for each individual OMC to determine the amount of the service charge on an annual basis.

The Act sets out clearly that the service charge must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC. <\/p>  <p>  Section 24 of the Act contains provisions for the resolution of disputes relating to multi-unit developments.

The Court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation. The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  This Act does not specify interest rates in relation to service charges.

It is something I am very grateful for because it is so important to our understanding of where there are gaps in the system and reforms that need to be advanced. It also shows victims of similar abuse that they are not alone and hopefully encourages others to reach out for support and to report the abuse. <\/p>  <p>  From the information I have on the campaign mentioned by the Deputy, the aims of it, in particular its focus on education and training, on awareness raising and on promoting responsible online behaviour, are to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, 'Coco's Law', which has been enacted as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, entered into force on 10 February 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Coco&rsquo;s Law gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the tools they need to make sure that those who commit abusive crimes both online and offline can be prosecuted and, if prosecuted and found guilty, our courts now have sentences available to them that reflect the level of harm these crimes cause to their victims. I understand from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that training on The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act will be covered on level 3 witness training as of the 10th May 2021 in the lesson entitled &lsquo;Victims of Sex Crime&rsquo; (delivered by Garda National Protective Services Bureau).<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently running the No Excuses campaign which aims to increase awareness of sexual harassment and sexual violence in Irish society. Our plan is to incorporate information on Coco&rsquo;s Law into this campaign in the coming months. This will include a focus on ensuring there is public awareness of the fact that the sharing of intimate images is a form of sexual abuse and one which now carries a significant penalty.<\/p>  <p>  We intend to communicate our message in a way that will build on our existing No Excuses campaign and its key message of not excusing sexual harassment or sexual violence.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important time to increase awareness and educate people about the consequences both legal and psychological of sharing images without consent. <\/p>  <p>  'Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo;, which will be implemented as a priority, places a strong emphasis on the need for victims to be treated with dignity and respect at every stage throughout the process and includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey through the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. <\/p>  <p>  To deliver on this objective, a sub-group has been tasked with identifying gaps in the current provision and recommending measures to address same, ascertaining the types of training that is needed, and designing a framework for its delivery. In the coming weeks, we will be advertising for expressions of interest from consultants who can work with us to analyse existing training provision and identify where the gaps are: this is the first step in putting additional training provisions in place to meet unmet needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800118#WRPP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":2047,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800118#WRPP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2048,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[21287\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800118#WRPP01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she is taking to ensure that persons can apply for work and residency permits and citizenship in Irish; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":2049,"qnumday":824,"qnumall":"[21907\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800118#WRPP01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way in which her Department and agencies under her remit facilitate persons wishing to engage with their services through the Irish language; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":2050,"qnumday":825,"qnumall":"[21925\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800118#WRPP01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if all forms issued by her Department and agencies under her remit are available in both the Irish and English languages; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2051,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 797, 824 and 825 together.<\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that, as of last week, the Irish version of the Form 8 application for Irish citizenship has been updated and is available on our website at: <\/p><p>www.irishimmigration.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Foirm-8-21-04-2021.pdf). <\/p><p>This new translation of the 36-page form is a highly legal document, containing\u00a0three declarations, provisions in relation to GDPR, and detailed instructions on completing the form. It sets\u00a0a valuable precedent for the translation of all application forms for Irish citizenship, which my Department, in written communications with the Office of the Language Commissioner, has committed to providing by the end of September. <\/p><p>The Form 8 application for citizenship (adult application) is by far the most frequently used form and was therefore prioritised for translation. However, work on the translation of the other citizenship application forms has already commenced. <\/p><p>My Department has the necessary resources in place to ensure that people wishing to make citizenship applications through Irish can do so.\u00a0There are currently two officials in the Citizenship Division who are competent to carry out their business through Irish.<\/p><p>More broadly, my Department facilitates anyone wishing to engage with its services through the Irish language. There are 30 members of staff across the Department who are available to provide services and answer queries in Irish. 23 courses were run in the offices of my Department in Dublin and Killarney from 2006, the commencement year of the Department&rsquo;s Irish Scheme. Those courses were tailored specifically\u00a0for the officials\u00a0of my Department, and related to both written and oral Irish.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department has supported &ndash; and continues to support &ndash; members of staff who wish to attend Irish courses outside of the Department and to do online Irish courses. Last year, 15 officials participated, at various levels, in the Certificate in Professional Irish course provided by Gaelchult&uacute;r. Through their attendance at those courses, the ability and confidence of those officials to serve the public through Irish, as regards spoken and written Irish, has increased.<\/p><p>As stated in our Irish Language Scheme, despite its broad range of functional areas,\u00a0my Department generally does not provide services directly to the public except in a number of specific areas. <\/p><p>Since early 2003,\u00a0my Department has employed an Irish translator principally to oversee and carry out translations of the Rules of Court. Since then, my Department has published the official Irish version of the 1986, 1997 and 2001 consolidations of the Rules of the Superior Courts, the District Court Rules and the Circuit Court Rules, and many of the Amendments subsequently made to them, including the Rules of the Superior Courts (Court of Appeal Act 2014) 2014.

The Act was amended by Section 54 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which gave the Board the additional responsibility to provide a family mediation service.<\/p><p>Section 3(3) of the Act provides that the Board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions. <\/p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board, and I am informed that, civil legal aid and advice is provided primarily through a network of law centres by solicitors employed by the Board.  There are 30 full time and 12 part time law centres.\u00a0<\/p><p>Family mediation services are provided through 8 full time offices and 9 part time offices. The Legal Aid Board has established a number of co-located centres in Portlaoise, Kilkenny, Jervis House in Dublin, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Limerick and Tallaght.  These centres operate a full time law centre and either a full or part time mediation centre.  Court-based family mediation services are available in a number of courts around the country including\u00a0Dolphin House in Dublin, Ennis, Carlow and Mullingar. <\/p><p>The waiting times for family mediation services as of 26 April 2021, are set out in the table below provided by the Board. I am informed that there is no waiting list for Ennis or Dolphin House, both of\u00a0which\u00a0provide a walk-in service. Information on the number of applicants awaiting an appointment and the length of time they are waiting in weeks is maintained by the Legal Aid Board on an office by office basis rather than by county. The Board advises that the number waiting may include some applicants who have already been offered appointments and have not been able to accept them for one reason or another.\u00a0I am further advised that the current average waiting time for a mediation appointment across the country is 17 weeks. <\/p><p>The Board operates a co-located law and mediation centre in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal.\u00a0As can be seen from the table below, the number of people\u00a0awaiting a mediation appointment in this centre, as of 26 April 2021, stands at 13 and the longest time for a person awaiting a mediation appointment is 12 weeks.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Board offers short notice appointments to\u00a0applicants that can accept\u00a0a cancellation.\u00a0Applicants with\u00a0a pending Court date are offered priority appointments where possible.\u00a0 Currently under Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, the Board offers online and telephone appointments.\u00a0 Many\u00a0applicants have availed of mediation sessions through these mediums.  However,\u00a0I understand that some are choosing to wait until face to face mediation sessions can be facilitated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In Budget 2021, I provided an increased provision of over &euro;2 million for the Legal Aid Board in 2021 bringing total funding of the Legal Aid Board to &euro;44.6 million, a 6% increase.  This will enable the Board to recruit additional staff and meet other costs to enhance delivery of all of its services across the country.<\/p><p>My Department also continues to work with the Legal Aid Board and other key stakeholders across the Justice Sector as part of a planned return to normal business levels under the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 &ndash; the Path Ahead&rdquo;.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In terms of broader reform, preparations are also being made by my Department for the formal establishment by Ministerial Order of the Mediation Council.

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.<\/p>  <p>  The HPSC published new visiting guidance on 23rd April, which comes into effect on 4th May, and will provide additional opportunities to visit nursing home residents. Residents may now be facilitated to receive four routine visits per week. This will be possible following two weeks after the full vaccination of approximately 8 out of 10 of all residents in the nursing home. Otherwise, two visits per week should be facilitated. The duration of visits should be appropriate to the needs of the resident and should not be less than one hour. Where there is high vaccine coverage, 2 people may visit at a time but there is no requirement to limit the number of nominated visitors.<\/p>  <p>  If a visitor is fully vaccinated and is visiting in a room with a resident who is fully vaccinated with no other person present, they do not need to wear masks or avoid physical contact.<\/p>  <p>  A copy of the latest guidance can be accessed through the link below: <\/p>  <p>  www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/respiratory\/coronavirus\/novelcoronavirus\/guidance\/infectionpreventionandcontrolguidance\/residentialcarefacilities\/Guidance%20on%20visits%20to%20RCF.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and public health advice must continue to be followed, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance also re-states the existing position that there are very limited, if any, circumstances, including outbreaks, in which outdoor or window visiting should be suspended on infection prevention and control grounds.<\/p>  <p>  I have recently written to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the need for all providers to follow the HPSC guidance on visitation. I have also met with HIQA on this matter to stress the importance of implementation of the guidance. The adoption of a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the key role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing must be sustained. I expect every effort to be made to ensure visits are facilitated to the greatest extent possible, in line with the new guidance and public health advice. Providers are also encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800120#WRRR03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800120#WRRR03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2183,"qnumday":843,"qnumall":"[21140\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800120#WRRR03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if further assistance will be provided for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2184,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800120#WRRR03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance","counter":2185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800120#WRRR03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2186,"qnumday":844,"qnumall":"[21141\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800120#WRRR03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason some insurance companies are refusing to provide health insurance to persons who become ill as a result of receiving the Covid-19 vaccine; if companies can refuse to provide insurance for this reason to persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1555","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2187,"content":"<p>I am not aware of the issue which the Deputy has raised.

They have made an enormous contribution to the protection of everybody living in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The past year has highlighted the critical national importance of an appropriately resourced public health workforce, and through the Covid-19 Path Ahead Plan, this Government has committed to investment in, and resourcing of public health and the delivery of a strengthened and reformed consultant-delivered public health model.<\/p>  <p>  The new model will radically change the governance and operating structure within Public Health, introducing a more fit-for-purpose National and Regional management structure across each of the pillars of Public Health.<\/p>  <p>  This will be a Consultant-led model which will enable the recruitment and retention of Public Health Doctors with the capability, autonomy, authority and accountability to lead multidisciplinary teams to deliver an agile, dynamic, intelligence-led public health service to protect the population from health threats, promote health, improve health services and tackle health inequalities.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the Consultant role will also bring the status of this specialty in line with other countries, as Ireland has, for many years, been an outlier in not recognising the specialty at consultant status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS03300"},{"type":"question","counter":2240,"qnumday":862,"qnumall":"[21176\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason student nurses have to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to take up employment given this does not apply to their senior colleagues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2241,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cannabis for Medicinal Use","counter":2242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2243,"qnumday":863,"qnumall":"[21177\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the prerequisites for adding products to the Medical Cannabis Access Programme; if products can only be added to the Programme if previously prescribed in another EU member state; if so, the reason; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2244,"content":"<p>Products\u00a0submitted to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) for assessment under the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019\u00a0must meet the definition of \"specified controlled drug\" as defined in the regulations\u00a0for inclusion in the Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP), one of the conditions being\u00a0that the product is permitted to be sold or supplied for medical purposes by the relevant public or state body of a Member State other than the State.

These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p><p>In addition, the prescribing of Best Value Biologic medicines is leading to significant savings for the health service, which is assisting us in facilitating access to new, innovative medicines for patients. In 2019, the HSE introduced the Gainshare Initiative, which provides a financial incentive to public hospitals and clinics to pursue biosimilar treatment switching programmes. By December 2020, almost 12,000 patients have switched to a best-value-biologic (BvB), almost 57% of the claims submitted to PCRS for payment was for the BvB alternative to the originator biologic and associated annual savings in excess of &euro;46 million has been achieved.\u00a0Despite the impediment of Covid-19, the HSE are progressing well in achieving savings in this area whilst maintaining the engagement of clinicians and the confidence of patients in the safety and efficacy of this technology.<\/p><p>Ireland has also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.\u00a0 In June 2018, Ireland joined the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Initiative is in line with the objective of working with other European countries to identify workable collaborative solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.\u00a0 In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which aims to assist member states' planning and allocation of resources with respect to new medicines.<\/p><p>While progress has been positive, the Department of Health and HSE are continuously monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of current levers to ensure that the State can capitalise on the most efficient policy approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2249,"qnumday":865,"qnumall":"[21179\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800121#WRSS04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has undertaken an analysis for minimising the delivery of low value care in the context of the entire health service; if so, the conclusions and recommendations of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2250,"content":"<p>The Department continually seeks to ensure that high quality patient outcomes are gained for the investments made in the health service.

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. <\/p>  <p>  This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the Programme for Government commits to introducing this amendment to the Nursing Home Support Scheme and work on the legislation has continued to progress.

This data includes 1,571 inpatient drug treatment cases, where the client attending the service stays overnight, e.g., in-patient detoxification, therapeutic communities, respite, and step down, and 2,806 inpatient alcohol treatment cases. <\/p>  <p>  It is important when looking at waiting lists for drug and alcohol services to be aware of the impact COVID-19 had on society and particularly on drug and alcohol service provision. Several factors have impacted on waiting lists for drug and alcohol detoxification over the course of the pandemic. These include (a) a reduction in capacity to comply with public health guidance, (b) restrictions on new entries, (c) closures due to outbreaks and (d) difficulties carrying out face to face assessments and validating waiting lists as many of the interactions are telephone only. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the necessary Covid-19 safeguards have resulted in increases in waiting times for residential addiction treatment across the country ranging from an average of 2-6 weeks in some services to an average of 6-9 months in other services. The HSE cannot change the capacity issues that have arisen due to the introduction of social distancing measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the limitations of Covid-19, the Department of Health provided an additional &euro;2 million for residential drug and alcohol treatment services in 2021. This funding will provide an additional 100 stabilisation treatment episodes as part of the North East Inner City initiative, a further 150 episodes nationally in tier 4 residential treatment services and 100 treatment episodes in a residential step-up treatment facility for CHOs 3, 4 and 5. In addition, over &euro;1.3 million is being provided for the establishment of a 20 bed residential therapeutic community for expectant women and women with children in the mid-west region, which will cater for 125 episodes per annum.<\/p>  <p>  In summary this &euro;3.3m in additional funding will provide an additional 475 treatment episodes this year.  <\/p>  <p>  Several important initiatives have been introduced to restore and continue access to drug and alcohol services during Covid-19.  The Department of Health has issued guidance for the operation of drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes during COVID-19, including in level 5.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department has developed a 'Framework for the &lsquo;Restoration and Continuation of Drug and Alcohol services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. To support the Framework, the Department provided once-off funding of &euro;480,000 in November 2020 for the restoration of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings, and personal protective equipment.  In addition, the HSE has also provided guidance for the safe delivery of residential treatment services.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the provision of drug and alcohol treatment services. I acknowledge the challenges faced by service providers during Covid-19 and will continue to support service providers to fully resume services.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800123#WRUU03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800123#WRUU04000"},{"type":"question","counter":2362,"qnumday":904,"qnumall":"[21356\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800123#WRUU04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide clarification regarding mandatory hotel quarantine for children (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1580","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2363,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Health Act 1947 (Exempted Traveller) (COVID-19) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2021, persons who are fully vaccinated, as well as any dependents who accompany them, are now exempt from the requirement to undergo quarantine in a designated facility.

This includes a specific commitment to supporting \"the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland\". A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  The endometriosis workstream identified a number of potential actions in this area, including enhanced services and supports such as the establishment of a centre of excellence for endometriosis surgery and optional access to psychologists in women&rsquo;s health settings, and enhanced information including a clear patient flow for period\/pelvic pain and excessive bleeding and\u00a0a communications and education strategy to raise awareness of endometriosis and the supports and treatments available.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5million &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Fund&rsquo; to progress a programme of actions arising from the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. On 21 April I announced the first two areas to be funded from the Fund: two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services in Tallaght and Limerick\/Nenagh and the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital, with an associated cost of &euro;641k, will deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland. Endometriosis is estimated to affect 1 in 10 women and represents one of the top four categories of symptoms that comprise approximately 80% of gynaecology referrals. The provision of a secure, supported, expanded and specialist service in Tallaght University Hospital will help to improve both clinical outcomes and overall care experience for women suffering from this debilitating condition.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that the\u00a0 HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.\u00a0 As such, the Programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.\u00a0 An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.\u00a0 It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The roll out of Phase One of the new Model of Care commenced in 2020, and the first three clinics were established under the governance of the Rotunda Hospital, Cork University Maternity Hospital, and University Hospital Galway and are providing services. Development funding has been provided in 2021, which will accelerate the implementation of the Model of Care, through the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics this year.\u00a0 Subject to available resources, it is envisaged that up to 19 such clinics will be rolled out in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has also asked about treatment abroad for endometriosis. The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled under EU Regulation 883\/04.\u00a0 The TAS is a consultant lead scheme and allows for an Ireland-based public consultant to refer a public patient who is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in the public healthcare system of another EU member state, the UK or Switzerland. Subject to the EU Regulations and Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved public treatments in another EU\/EEA member state, the UK or Switzerland through the issue of form S2 (IE) where the treatment is: <\/p>  <p>  - Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation, <\/p>  <p>  - Not available in Ireland, <\/p>  <p>  - Not available within the time normally  necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's  current state of health and the probable course of the disease. medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs; <\/p>  <p>  - a proven form of medical treatment and  not experimental or test treatment; <\/p>  <p>  - provided in a recognised public hospital or other institution that will accept EU\/EEA form S2 (IE) and; <\/p>  <p>  - is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Health I do not have a role in directing insurers to provide coverage for treatments beyond those prescribed in the minimum benefit regulations. The minimum benefit regulations provide that all health insurance contracts must provide cover for a broad range of in-patient hospital services, and these include laparoscopy for diagnosis and\/or treatment of endometriosis. I would advise any health insurance customer seeking treatment for endometriosis to consult their table of benefits and contact their insurer to determine what treatments their health insurance contract covers.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to treatment abroad via health insurance for endometriosis, again this differs depending on the health insurance contract in question. The minimum benefit regulations do not provide that health insurers must provide cover for treatment abroad, but many plans do where a treatment is medically necessary and the required procedure is not available in Ireland. Again, I would advise a health insurance customer seeking treatment abroad for endometriosis or any other condition to consult the table of benefits for their health insurance contract and to contact their insurer when planning treatment abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2413,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2414,"qnumday":916,"qnumall":"[21396\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the speed with which the legislative changes to exempt vaccinated persons from a mandatory hotel quarantine upon arrival in Ireland will take effect; and if an approximate date can be given for same.","asker":"1519","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2415,"qnumday":955,"qnumall":"[21536\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a system for exempting persons who have been vaccinated from quarantine requirements has been worked out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2416,"qnumday":1086,"qnumall":"[22239\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on preparations to facilitate fully vaccinated persons from entering mandatory hotel quarantine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2417,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 916, 955 and 1086 together.<\/p><p>Mandatory hotel quarantine has been introduced as one element of Ireland&rsquo;s public health measures to combat the transmission of COVID-19 variants of concern.<\/p><p>The Health Act 1947, as amended, provides that all persons arriving in Ireland from a designated state, or having travelled through a designated state in the previous 14 days, are required to undergo mandatory quarantine in a designated facility unless they are an exempted traveller under the Act.

To board a flight\/ferry to Ireland, an unaccompanied minor must produce a negative RT-PCR test within the last 72 hours and their passport.<\/p>  <p>  Their adult guardian can enter mandatory hotel quarantine with them, however, if this is not possible a responsible adult collecting the unaccompanied minor must sign a guardian release letter undertaking in writing the legal responsibility for ensuring that, the unaccompanied minor, will complete the mandatory 14 day quarantine at a specified address and that it is possible to effectively isolate at the said address.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In instances where an unaccompanied minor is arriving in Ireland to attend boarding school, a school representative must present themselves to Irish Immigration authorities with proper identification and on arrival, they will fill in, sign and return the Guardian Release Letter to the Irish immigration official. It is a criminal offence to give misleading or fraudulent information to an Irish immigration official.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0All guests undergoing mandatory quarantine in a designated facility are being provided with access to a 24\/7 on-site medically qualified healthcare team who hold clinical responsibility for their wellbeing during their stay. The on-site health team are available to address any wellbeing concerns of guests through both scheduled check-ins during a guest's stay as well as through\u00a0direct engagement if requested. <\/p>  <p>  The State Liaison Officer (SLO) will have staff onsite 24\/7 at each designated facility to liaise between guests and the service provider if required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2431,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV05600"},{"type":"question","counter":2432,"qnumday":922,"qnumall":"[21405\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of those reported to Deputies as having died with Covid-19 at a HSE mid-west briefing on 26 March 2021, that had Covid-19 recorded as the disease or condition directly leading cause of death; and, in the said number of cases in which Covid-19 was recorded as the disease or condition directly leading to death, the number that had other significant conditions contributing to the death recorded.","asker":"1518","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2433,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2434,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV05900"},{"type":"question","counter":2435,"qnumday":923,"qnumall":"[21407\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the acute hospitals that have been contacted for lists of heart failure patients with regard to the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2436,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crisis Pregnancy Services","counter":2437,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV06200"},{"type":"question","counter":2438,"qnumday":924,"qnumall":"[21408\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800124#WRVV06300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of his plans to regulate rogue crisis pregnancy agencies that seek to delay and misinform those seeking information on abortion services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2439,"content":"<p>The State-provided My Options information service is the first port of call for someone with an unplanned pregnancy seeking information and support.

In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.\u00a0<\/p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).<\/p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:  <\/p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most; <\/p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; <\/p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.\u00a0<\/p><p>Further details are available here:<\/p><p><i>https:\/\/www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list\/\u00a0<\/i><\/p><p>Vaccination of Group 4 began in March and vaccine\u00a0registration for Groups 5 and 6 began on the 15th of April.<\/p><p>In relation to family carers, it is important to emphasise that:<\/p><p>(a) carers who are healthcare workers are at a very high or high risk of exposure to the virus.

own homes, which allowed for in-person measurements of height, weight, waist circumference and BMI to be conducted. However, the most recent wave of the Healthy Ireland Survey, for which results have not yet been published, was conducted by computer aided telephone interview (CATI). This methodology is in line with current necessary COVID-19 restrictions and infection control requirements but does not enable measurement in person. \u00a0The Department is committed to administering the Healthy Ireland survey annually. The eighth wave, scheduled to commence interviewing in the Autumn, will be conducted using CATI. The possibility of returning to the CAPI format will be reviewed annually. Presentation and interpretation of the survey trends will take account of the switch to the CATI methodology.<\/p>  <p>  While the data in relation to the targets in the OPAP are not complete, it is clear that obesity remains a significant challenge.\u00a0 For this reason, there is a renewed focus on combatting obesity by this government, and a particular emphasis on addressing health inequalities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.\u00a0 In terms of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan, an evaluation of the policy is being carried out by the Centre for Health and Diet Research in University College Cork, which is expected to be completed by June 2021.\u00a0 This will be an important input to the mid-term review of the OPAP which will be carried out this year, which will lead to a refreshed and updated Plan with a revised set of actions for the remaining lifetime of the OPAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800128#WRZZ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2639,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 1002 to 1005, inclusive, answered with Question No. 914.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Data","counter":2640,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800128#WRZZ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":2641,"qnumday":1006,"qnumall":"[21768\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800128#WRZZ03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of general practitioner referrals and attendance numbers for symptomatic breast disease and prostate rapid access clinics in each of the past five years and to date in 2021.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2642,"content":"<p>The below table shows the numbers of electronic GP referrals to symptomatic breast disease (urgent and non-urgent) and prostate rapid access clinics in each of the past five years and to date in 2021.

The Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of Covid-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for Covid-19 clusters are identified.<\/p><p>Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to Covid-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. Residents of nursing homes are vulnerable because of their age, underlying medical conditions, the extent of their requirement for direct care involving close physical contact and the nature of living in congregated settings. The very infectious nature of Covid-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. The transmission of the virus into and within nursing homes is multifactorial. As identified by the Nursing Homes Expert Panel, where there is ongoing community transmission, settings like nursing homes are more vulnerable to exposure. <\/p><p>The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need to set up a structured support system in line with NPHET recommendations.

The Scheme opened in April 2020 and was extended until 30 June 2021.<\/p><p>Most nursing home residents are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and the positive benefits of the vaccine are being seen. For example, in recognition of the effective vaccine rollout to nursing home residents, and the increasing evidence of the protection conferred by full vaccination, new guidance has been developed that further expands the scope of visiting. <\/p><p>People living in nursing homes where there is high vaccine coverage will be facilitated with four routine visits every week from 4th May <\/p><p>Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with Covid-19 remains very real.

They assess the extent and nature of the drug problem and initiate appropriate responses, so that there is a coordinated approach involving all sectors to the problem of substance misuse in local communities and local communities are consulted in the design and deliver services.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health provides\u00a0&euro;28m in funding to\u00a0the 24 drug and alcohol task forces\u00a0that operate throughout the country in defined geographical areas. The Department\u00a0engages with key stakeholders in the network of drug and alcohol task forces and takes input on the level of need in local communities, from those service providers working in the community. This in turn informs\u00a0decision-making relating to the\u00a0allocation of funding and provision of services.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has developed a 'Framework for the &lsquo;Restoration and Continuation of Drug and Alcohol services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. To support the Framework, the Department provided once-off funding of &euro;480,000 in November 2020 for the restoration of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings, and personal protective equipment.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1 million was provided in Budget 2021 to develop targeted drug and alcohol initiatives through the network of drug and alcohol task forces. The allocation of this funding will be informed by the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy and strategic action plan 2021-2025, which\u00a0will be finalised shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last few months, I have met with drug and alcohol task forces to discuss\u00a0support for their work in identifying and responding to local needs, including the challenges for people who use drugs during Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ensure that the additional resources are directed towards those interventions which are most likely to lead to a reduction in problem drug use and a positive improvement in public health.\u00a0In particular, the funding\u00a0should be used to expand the\u00a0availability of drug and alcohol services in communities based on identified need, especially in communities\u00a0that have limited access to services at the moment.

This commitment is underlined by the significant increase of &euro;50 million in Exchequer funds for HSE Mental Health Services in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Department welcomes the report on mental health services for older people published by the Mental Health Commission.\u00a0It should be noted that there is a wide range of mental supports for older people in place. Nationally, there are 32 psychiatry of later life community teams. These teams support people to remain in their homes and in the community where possible, in line with Slaintecare recommendations. In addition, the HSE provides over 400 inpatient mental health beds dedicated for older people. <\/p>  <p>  Healthy ageing and the mental health of older people was recognised as a key consideration during the development of Sharing the Vision. The policy identifies the importance of promoting positive mental health in the older population and of providing appropriate specialist mental health services to older people. Late last year, a National Implementation and Monitoring Committee was established to drive and oversee implementation of the policy over the next 10 years. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the HSE launched the Specialist Geriatric Services model of care. It outlines how specialist mental health services for people aged 65 and over should be developed appropriately to focus on supporting the mental health needs of this group. <\/p>  <p>  The model of care recognises the importance of integrated care. It focuses on a number of areas, including improving clinical pathways in the community and acute hospitals and building on relationships with primary care and geriatric medicine. <\/p>  <p>  This programme is complemented by the recent launch of the HSE Model of Care for Talking Therapies, which applies to all adults, including those over 65.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland Framework makes a clear commitment to improving partnerships, strategies and initiatives that support older people to maintain, improve or manage their physical and mental wellbeing, by addressing risk factors and promoting protective measures to support lifelong health and wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>  The Framework will also lead to increased mental health supports for those in long-term palliative care and the development of age-friendly services in community and primary care settings.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Department of Health&rsquo;s Keep Well campaign\u00a0for living with Covid, &euro;7 million has been invested to support the delivery of wellbeing and resilience initiatives with a range of partners. These initiatives include supports for older people.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the existing range of mental health supports available, including those promoted through yourmentalhealth.ie or 1800 111 888 can be accessed by older people. These include for example free online counselling delivered though MyMind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":2875,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2876,"qnumday":1090,"qnumall":"[22259\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will receive a date for admission to Beaumont Hospital for spinal surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2877,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Elective hospital care was curtailed for the first quarter of 2021, in line with the rapid increase in Covid -19 hospital admissions, with only critical time dependent elective procedures undertaken. <\/p>  <p>  On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding long Covid, as COVID 19 is still a relatively new disease information on it, its features and its course are just emerging. Longer term observational studies will be required to fully understand the health consequences presently being attributed to post COVID-19 infection and management of persisting symptoms that will in time provide higher quality evidence and assist guideline development for appropriate provision of care. It is noted however that medical card holders can access GP and hospital services free of charge irrespective of the type of illness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE03125"},{"type":"question","counter":2900,"qnumday":1098,"qnumall":"[22313\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE03150","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if those aged over 60 years of age have a choice in relation to the vaccine which will be administered to them particularly persons that have been prone to blood clots previously; if he is satisfied with the safety of a vaccine (details supplied) for this age cohort; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2901,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":2902,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2903,"qnumday":1099,"qnumall":"[22321\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800133#WREEE03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of all National Treatment Purchase Fund offers made to University Hospital Kerry in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021; the details of offers which were accepted and declined, not accepted or not responded to, respectively; the dates and number of patients involved in each; the types of procedures involved in each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2904,"content":"<p>\u00a0The information requested by the Deputy is being collated by Department officials.

Everyone must play their part in protecting our landscapes and supporting our emergency services and ensuring they are not needlessly diverted by illegal fires. <\/p><p>There is a inherent natural risk of fire in our uplands and on bogs at this time of year, due to the condition of vegetation in these area. Upland grasses, heather and gorse are highly flammable in spring when the\u00a0weather is dry.\u00a0In the right conditions, any ignition, for any reason, can give rise to wildfires. Both landowners and the wider public, whether they are at work or enjoying the countryside, should be mindful of the significant risks of fire at this time of year and be aware of the damage to land and habitats caused by illegal burning and other accidental and unintentional ignitions.\u00a0The\u00a0Department conducts a number of activities annually to monitor and reduce wildfire incidence and outcomes.<\/p><p>The burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts. It is an offence under Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Act, 2000) to burn, from 1st March to 31st August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated. Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).\u00a0This Department\u00a0has no role in regard to prosecutions.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Department has issued reminders to all landowners in relation to illegal burning of agricultural lands, and any land found to have been burned illegally can be deemed ineligible across a number of area-based schemes. The\u00a0Department monitors fire activity and risk throughout the main risk period between March and September, using a variety of means at our disposal, including satellite detections and ground inspections. <\/p><p>The\u00a0Department has also undertaken a number of awareness measures aimed at reducing the level of illegal ignitions, particularly on farmland, and in ensuring that affected sectors are fully prepared for fire outbreaks where these occur. This includes the provision of Fire Danger Rating Notices to relevant sectors and Departments to ensure that the correct level of preparedness is maintained throughout the fire season. The Department also encourages the safe use of fire by land managers during the open burning season, and provides guidance for doing so.<\/p><p>It is important to note that wildfire ignitions occur from a variety of sources, not just agriculture, and many recent fires have occurred on lands with no associated agricultural activity, including lands used for turf cutting, and public lands with open access used by the public for recreation. Fires associated with illegal dumping on bogland are a particular problem. In 2020, some of the largest and most problematic fires occurred as a result of recreational land user activities.<\/p><p>The farming community has a central role to play in the control of fire in our landscapes through the management of land, and the reduction and maintenance of fire prone vegetation (such purple moor grass, heather, and gorse\/whin) as potential fuels in high fire risk areas. To this end, the\u00a0Department supports a number of locally-led schemes under the EIP-AGRI measure that in turn support the implementation of fire management activities on the ground including vegetation management activities. Projects of this type are now in place in many of the main fire risk locations in Ireland, including the Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, McGillicuddy Reeks, Inishowen Peninsula, Connemara, and within the Hen Harrier Project. <\/p><p>The Hen Harrier project is a\u00a0results-based project, supported by the Department, covering key habitats across a number of different counties. The project \u00a0has recently developed and implemented a number of specific fire management measures including upland grazing management and support, the development of ponds in high risk areas that can provide water for aerial fire fighting operations, and the safe use of fire as a land management tool by landowners. The project also liaises directly with relevant local fire services in areas where it operates. All of the upland projects involve fire management education and awareness building activities directly with landowners through project agricultural advisors and direct inputs from local fire and rescue services and experts from my Department and Teagasc. <\/p><p>The\u00a0Department activated its Fire Danger Rating System back in March for the fire season ahead and to date four such Fire Danger Notices notices have been issued, ahead of risk weather phases.\u00a0I would advise\u00a0Forest owners and managers to\u00a0check and update their fire plans and other relevant contingencies such as insurance, firebreaks, access and water points, and private helicopter contracts etc., so as to be prepared well in advance of high fire risk phases. Rural dwellers should also assess wildfire risks to their homes and properties and prepare accordingly. Guidance for this is available from the Office of Emergency Planning &ldquo;Be Summer Ready&rdquo; awareness campaign <i>www.gov.ie\/summerready<\/i>.<\/p><p>There has been a very significant increase in the use of outdoor amenities and recreation sites by the public since the onset of Covid-19. This is a very welcome development, however forest visitors are reminded not to light fires or use barbecues, to behave responsibly, observe relevant local bye-laws, observe correct physical distancing practice and to park considerately so as not to impede access of emergency vehicles to incidents. <\/p><p>There is a very firm link in recent years between serious wildfire ignitions and illegal dumping and burning of domestic waste in many areas, and malicious burning at forest amenity sites and turf bogs open to the public. The Department asks all countryside users to be vigilant, to report any suspicious activity to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires immediately to the Fire and Emergency Services via 112\/999 service. We all have our part to play in protecting our countryside from uncontrolled fires.<\/p><p>Fire warnings can be accessed at: <i> and <\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800136#WRHHH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":3065,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800136#WRHHH02500"},{"type":"question","counter":3066,"qnumday":1155,"qnumall":"[22033\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800136#WRHHH02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there are obligations for export health certificates on products of animal origin to be carried out by a registered vet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":3067,"qnumday":1156,"qnumall":"[22034\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800136#WRHHH02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there is precedent in Ireland or internationally for inspectors from his Department to certify products of animal origin for export; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":3068,"qnumday":1157,"qnumall":"[22035\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800136#WRHHH02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on whether allowing dairy inspectors to sign-off on export health certificates may reduce some of the post-Brexit delays for exports of products of animal origin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3069,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1155 to 1157, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Export Health certification requirements, including the designated signatory, are set by the importing country.<\/p><p>In many instances, dairy produce inspectors sign export health certificates where the importing country permits.

Last week I also launched a call for &euro;14 million in funding for outdoor recreation projects under the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Other Government investments in rural Ireland include the &euro;2.7 billion National Broadband Plan, &euro;108 million for the Bord na Mona Peat Restoration Project and other huge commitments towards transport infrastructure such as roads, rail, and walking and cycling amenities.<\/p>  <p>  The breadth of public policy measures included in Our Rural Future means that investment will be provided by programmes delivered by colleagues across the full spectrum of Governmental responsibility including\u00a0in areas such as communications, transport, enterprise support, healthcare and\u00a0education. <\/p>  <p>  Strong levels of existing funding will be supplemented by support for new and emerging priorities, which will be considered both in the review of the National Development Plan and discussions in the preparation of Budget 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800137#WRJJJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":3129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800137#WRJJJ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":3130,"qnumday":1180,"qnumall":"[21785\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800137#WRJJJ03900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if she has received an application from a group (details supplied) for funding to support its programme; the extent to which she expects to be in a position to respond positively in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":3131,"content":"<p>My Department has received an application from the organisation in question for the Community Development Pilot Programme.<\/p><p>The closing date for receipt of applications was Wednesday 31st March and a large number of high quality applications was received.\u00a0A two stage assessment is underway to examine the applications against the criteria set out.\u00a0It is expected that sucessful applicants will be notified at the end of May.<\/p><p>All applicants have been informed of the timeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800137#WRJJJ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Language","counter":3132,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800137#WRJJJ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":3133,"qnumday":1181,"qnumall":"[21909\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800137#WRJJJ04200","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the way in which her Department and agencies under her remit facilitate persons wishing to engage with their services through the Irish language; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":3134,"qnumday":1182,"qnumall":"[21927\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042800137#WRJJJ04300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if all forms issued by her Department and agencies under her remit are available in both the Irish and English languages; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":3135,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1181 and 1182 together.<\/p>  <p>My Department's first Irish Language Scheme came into effect on 8 April 2019 and shall remain in force for the period of three years from 2019 to 2022.
