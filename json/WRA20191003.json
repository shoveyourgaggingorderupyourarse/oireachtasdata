This is particularly the case where vulnerabilities may only be disclosed or become evident\u00a0after the initial stage of the protection process. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In June 2018,\u00a0Ireland opted into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive. This Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants. Article 21 of the Directive requires Member States, in implementing the Directive, to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons, and Article 22 provides for the assessment of the special reception needs of vulnerable persons. The Article also sets out that the assessment need not take the form of an administrative procedure. For the purposes of the Directive and Regulation 8 of the 2018 transposing Regulations, vulnerable persons include minors, unaccompanied minors, disabled people, elderly people, pregnant women, single parents, victims of human trafficking, persons with serious illnesses, persons with mental disorders and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence, such as victims of female genital mutilation. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is continually reviewing how\u00a0to improve services to applicants and my officials are currently examining the options available to improve the procedure for the identification and assessment of those applicants deemed to be vulnerable in accordance with Article 21 of the Reception Conditions Directive.<\/p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can\u00a0meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has recently commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes. I\u00a0look forward to the outcome of this research.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to current procedures, every applicant has an initial interview conducted when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin. If the applicant indicates that they require accommodation , he or she will\u00a0then be assessed for any specific reception needs. The result of the assessment is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the individual.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Applicants are also invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis. A Health Screening Team, which is funded and managed by the HSE, is located onsite at the Balseskin Reception Centre for this purpose. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical\/administration support. The team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psychosocial needs\u00a0and makes onward referrals for\u00a0any further treatment required. These health professionals communicate with\u00a0my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS - formerly RIA), within the bounds of patient confidentiality, if a particular need is identified that\u00a0will impact the person's accommodation requirements. In the coming weeks, a new primary care facility will be opening in Balseskin, which will enable the health care team to provide their services in a facility that is to the standard of all new HSE primary care facilities. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, arrangements are in\u00a0place with Safetynet, who carry out health screening in various parts of the country on behalf of the HSE, to offer the screening service to those who do not, for whatever reason, avail of it in Dublin. Staff from Safetynet liaise with the IPAS if the person is deemed vulnerable on medical or related grounds. This can include a request that special arrangements should be taken regarding the assignment of the person's accommodation, for example if they need to be located near a particular hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300045#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Law Review","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300045#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[40123\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300045#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the recent report titled A Review of the Criminalisation of Paying for Sexual Services in Northern Ireland; if there is an update on the review of criminalisation of sex work under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>I am familiar with the Review of the Criminalisation of Paying for Sexual Services in Northern Ireland carried out by Queen's University Belfast and published on 18th September.\u00a0 That review was commissioned under the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act 2015 which introduced the offence of paying for sexual services. <\/p>  <p>  In this jurisdiction, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017\u00a0amended legislation relating to prostitution.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Part 4 of the 2017 Act provides for a new offence of paying for sexual activity with a prostitute.

It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between AGS and\u00a0PSNI, as well as specific joint investigations which take place when individual crime\u00a0incidents with a cross border dimension occur, such as the one underway into the\u00a0abduction and assault of an individual as already referred to.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Last week I attended the 17th Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co.

The recidivism rate stood at 55% in 2007, but the report shows it fell to 45.8% in 2012.\u00a0 Overall, this represents a decrease of 9.3% over a five\u00a0year period. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I was also pleased to note that the CSO study\u00a0published in June last\u00a0in relation to offenders sentenced to\u00a0probation also recorded\u00a0noted significant\u00a0reductions,\u00a0with a drop of nearly 8 percentage points in re-offending rates recorded\u00a0between 2008 and 2012. \u00a0The report shows that\u00a0those sentenced to a Community Service Order were less likely to re-offend than those sentenced to a Probation Order. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0also\u00a0particularly welcome the finding that Community Service continues to show very good outcomes. Over 350,000\u00a0hours of community service work were carried out around the country\u00a0in 2018. This not only benefits communities nationwide and allows offenders a chance to make amends for their criminal actions in a tangible way, but the findings of the CSO&rsquo;s work clearly\u00a0shows that such orders can also help reduce re-offending rates by the individuals involved.<\/p>  <p>  While there is clearly scope\u00a0for further improvement, overall this evidence is\u00a0very positive. It means that more ex-offenders are turning their lives around, and fewer are going on to re-offend, with all the negative consequences that brings for our communities.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0expect that future studies in this CSO\u00a0series\u00a0are likely to\u00a0show a continuation of the downward trend as,\u00a0since\u00a02015, a range of enhanced prisoner programmes aimed at\u00a0reducing re-offending behavior\u00a0have been introduced by the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service.\u00a0These\u00a0include\u00a0targeting offenders\u00a0with high recidivism rates,\u00a0in particular through\u00a0the Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC), a\u00a0multi-agency approach to\u00a0prolific offenders which\u00a0prioritises\u00a0them for targeted interventions and supports to address their behaviour and thus\u00a0reduce crime and victimisation in local communities.\u00a0 Independent evaluations have\u00a0found that the JARC\u00a0pilots are helping to\u00a0reduce both the frequency and severity of reoffending among their clients groups and indeed have helped many offenders\u00a0to move away from criminality altogether.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that interventions of this nature\u00a0will assist in continuing the positive downward trajectory in recidivism, as identified by the CSO&rsquo;s most recent report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300046#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Protection","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300046#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[39978\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300046#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the promised independent inspectorate will be established further to the recent release of the national standards for accommodation offered to persons in the protection process;

Nonetheless, to try and be as helpful to the Deputy as possible, Insurance Europe, the European (re)insurance federation, produces reports on an ongoing basis regarding the insurance industry across Europe. For example, the European Insurance in Figures (2017 data) and the European Motor Insurance Markets, both published in early 2019, contain some useful comparative information in respect of insurance costs up to 2017. The European Insurance &mdash; Key Facts report published in October 2018, graphs the average premium level across European countries for a variety of insurance products for the year 2017. The varying levels of premiums across Europe are accounted for by a wide range of regulatory, risk and economic factors which differ across European jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to insurance costs, it was noted by the Personal Injuries Commission in their reports that it was not possible to have meaningful comparisons to the European data (excluding the UK) regarding award levels (which are a key driver for insurance costs) as this information was not provided to them or available at a sufficiently granular level. However, I acknowledge that both insurance costs and award levels for personal injuries in Ireland are much higher than in our European counterparts. This is why the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) is so important.<\/p>  <p>  The CIWG, which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report and the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report.\u00a0 Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).\u00a0 The Government is determined to keep working to ensure that these positive pricing trends continue and can be extended to other forms of insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[40487\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an anomaly by which if a self-employed person that files an income tax return and has not paid their local property tax, the Revenue Commissioners apply a 10% penalty to their total tax liability (details supplied); if he will make appropriate adjustments to the legislation in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that, similar to the position that applies in the case of other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences relating to local property tax (LPT), such as failure to submit a return or other documentation or the provision of false information. Thus, all taxpayers who fail to submit an LPT return, or who submit an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.<\/p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, a self-employed person is penalised for the late submission (or non-submission) of an income tax return by the imposition of a surcharge on his or her income tax liability. However, a self-employed person who has submitted his or her income tax return on time can also be liable to an income tax surcharge in respect of the late submission of his or her LPT return or the failure to pay LPT.\u00a0 Where such a person has not submitted his or her LPT return by the time that he or she submits an income tax return, the income tax liability is increased by 10% up to a maximum increase of &euro;63,485.\u00a0 However, where the LPT return is subsequently submitted and the associated LPT liability is paid, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a similar type surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit an LPT return on time. While PAYE taxpayers and self-employed taxpayers are treated the same in terms of the amount of their LPT liability, the same treatment is not necessary, and not always possible, in relation to how Revenue addresses non-compliance by such taxpayers.\u00a0 Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to enforce the collection of LPT liabilities from PAYE taxpayers through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension.\u00a0 As such an enforcement option can apply in the case of PAYE taxpayers, it is considered that linking non-compliance with LPT by self-employed persons with a surcharge on their income tax liabilities is both fair and proportionate.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Given the relatively low level of LPT liability for most property owners, the application of a 10% surcharge on a self-employed person&rsquo;s LPT liability alone would be unlikely to act as an effective deterrent to non-compliance.\u00a0 As I have already stated, having incurred a surcharge, a self-employed person has the opportunity to cap the surcharge at the amount of the LPT liability due by submitting an LPT return and\/or paying the LPT liability.\u00a0 Compliance is not just about ensuring the submission of returns and the payment of outstanding tax liabilities; there is also a timing aspect to compliance.\u00a0 Returns must be submitted and payments must be made by specified dates.\u00a0 It is considered that reducing a surcharge or penalty to nil following the late submission of returns or payments would serve only to incentivise such late submission. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time. There is no reason for property owners to put themselves in a position where they become liable to a penalty or surcharge.\u00a0 If an individual has particular financial circumstances which cause difficulties in meeting his or her LPT liability, he or she may be entitled to a deferral of the tax or may avail of one of a number of payment methods to discharge the liability evenly over the course of the year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[40383\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a company (details supplied) continues to be contracted to the OPW in respect of general maintenance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>Dublin Premier Carpentry Ltd T\/A Dublin Carpentry and Construction Ltd submitted an application form on the 11th February 2019, for inclusion on the OPW list of approved Building Contractors for tendering on up-coming building projects, fit outs and refurbishment work.\u00a0 This application was approved on the 30th April 2019 for the Dublin North, Dublin South, North East and South East regional lists for works up to &euro;100K.\u00a0 This list works on a rotational basis and Dublin Premier Carpentry Ltd T\/A Dublin Carpentry and Construction Ltd have not yet been invited to tender.\u00a0 There is no contractual commitment in this arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme Funding","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[40242\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300048#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will address the case of a person (details supplied) regarding flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":200,"content":"<p>I am advised that local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address.

The allocation of these new vehicles across the Garda Divisions is for Garda management and not for me as Minister. <\/p><p>I would also point out that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. We currently have over 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,700 Garda staff. And as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is ongoing and increased recruitment both of new Garda&iacute; as well as Garda staff, allowing for redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational duties at the front-line. Since the reopening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest by the end of this year. Further, the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019 will allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to frontline and visible policing duties by the end of this year. <\/p><p>As part of this overall increase, additional Garda resources have been deployed to border areas in recent months and this process is continuing.

These Gardai are supported by 44 Garda Staff, as of the same date.

Under the terms of the Scheme, the Tribunal is limited to a Chair and 6 ordinary members who provide services on a part-time basis. It is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that five Departmental staff act as Secretariat to the Tribunal. These staff receive applications and gather the necessary information from applicants and other stakeholders such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to each case. When all required information is available, Tribunal staff send the file to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. Where a decision is appealed, Tribunal staff make arrangements for a Tribunal appeal hearing.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the duration of the process, I should note that it may take several years before an application for compensation is ready for submission to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. For example final Garda reports on the crime are required, as are the outcomes of any court cases initiated. In addition, in some cases the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years. It is also the case that the assessment of loss of earnings for consideration by the Tribunal may be complex to determine and may require employer assessment and social welfare reports. These and other factors can have an impact on the duration of any particular application. <\/p>  <p>  An assessment is currently being carried out by officials of my Department in relation to caseload in the scheme, including the extent and nature of any possible backlog.

The Deputy will be aware that insolvent persons seeking legal advice and assistance in relation to repossession proceedings against their home may be able to avail of such advice through the Abhaile scheme.\u00a0 This free mortgage arrears support service was launched by the Government in October 2016.<\/p><p>Abhaile is not focused on bringing challenges to repossession proceedings because in most cases this will not help the borrower. Instead, Abhaile focuses on solving the borrower&rsquo;s substantive problem, by putting in place a solution to the arrears themselves, keeping the borrower in their home and helping them back to solvency.\u00a0<\/p><p>In relation to the focus of the Deputy's question on legal aid applications, it is possible to apply for legal aid from the Legal Aid Board to defend repossession proceedings under the normal rules relating to civil legal aid. Borrowers who wish to do this must meet the financial eligibility and merits criteria prescribed under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2017.\u00a0 The principal financial eligibility criteria are that the applicant must have disposable income of less than &euro;18,000 per annum and disposable capital assets of less than &euro;100,000 (excluding the home in which they live).\u00a0<\/p><p>In the past, it may have been difficult for applications for legal aid in connection with defending repossession proceedings to satisfy the merits criteria for civil legal aid in circumstances where the applicant accepts that the debt (i.e. the unpaid home loan) is owed to the Plaintiff lending institution and falls due to be paid and there is no legal defence available. The Deputy will be aware of the added protections conferred under the recently enacted Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Act 2019, however, it remains to be seen how the courts will interpret the new legislation.<\/p><p>Under Abhaile, by contrast, the borrower can obtain free independent financial advice and negotiation assistance from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, a MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears adviser, and\/or an accountant. The service includes detailed analysis of the borrower&rsquo;s individual financial situation and home mortgage arrears, identifying their best option to resolve their arrears with priority given to remaining in their home wherever possible, and negotiation assistance to put a solution into place.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Since the Abhaile service began in July 2016 and, as of 23rd September 2019, 3,763 vouchers for a legal advice consultation in relation to potential solutions to mortgage arrears (which may include advice in relation to the defence of possession proceedings) have been issued. A duty solicitor service is in place at county registrars&rsquo; courts for repossession proceedings and almost 8,000 people have availed of that service. It is important to note that persons availing of the Abhaile service do not have to meet any financial eligibility criteria, save that they are insolvent and at risk of losing their home, nor do they have to pay a contribution.\u00a0\u00a0This is a far more sustainable and effective focus for public intervention &ndash; both more effective for borrowers, and better for taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300050#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Firearms and Ammunition Security","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300050#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[40197\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300050#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the new regulations that have been introduced in relation to the safeguarding of ammunition in respect of shotguns and the requirement for them to be kept in a locked box in vehicles when they are not on the property of the owner; the consultation and the organisations that were involved in the discussions prior to these rules or regulations being introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, Statutory Instrument 420 of 2019 European Communities (Acquisition and Possession of Weapons and Ammunition) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 gives effect to Directive (EU) 2017\/853 in national law.<\/p><p>The main changes introduced relate to:<\/p><p>-  marking of firearms;<\/p><p>-  new storage requirements for firearms and ammunition;<\/p><p>-  prohibition of the acquisition of large capacity magazines; and <\/p><p>-  prohibition of certain firearms.<\/p><p>There was some consultation as part of the process of making this SI.\u00a0 All registered firearms dealers were invited to an initial consultation meeting with officials of my Department in Mullingar in August 2018, at which the new EU Directive was discussed.\u00a0 I understand that over 250 invitations were issued to that consultation and that 51 firearms dealers attended.\u00a0<\/p><p>It may be noted that there was significant time pressure for production of this Statutory Instrument, due to infringement proceedings commenced against Ireland by the European Commission.\u00a0 As such it was unfortunately not possible to organise a further consultation in advance of the making of the Statutory Instrument, between completion of the drafting process in July 2019 and signature of the regulations in August 2019.<\/p><p>I understand that the Statutory Instrument has now been circulated to members of the Firearms Consultative Panel and Registered Firearms Dealers and it has also been published on my Department's website, along with a guidance note.<\/p><p>Finally, I can confirm to the Deputy that my officials recently met with representatives of the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC), to allow them to outline any concerns.\u00a0 I have asked my officials to consider the matters raised and to\u00a0consult with the Office of the Attorney General, where relevant.

The 21st September marked the second anniversary of the Agreement&rsquo;s &lsquo;provisional application&rsquo;, under which EU\/Irish companies gain access to the removal of customs duties and substantially improved access to the Canadian public procurement market. \u00a0CETA also opened up new sectors of the Canadian services market, reduced regulatory barriers and provided more transparent rules for market access.\u00a0 Ireland already has a strong trading relationship with Canada which is reflected in the &euro;3.2 billion worth of annual trade between both countries. \u00a0The value of Irish exports to Canada is worth &euro;2.4 billion whilst the value of Irish imports from Canada is worth &euro;780 million.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  EU-Japan - The EU-Japan Economic Partnership (EPA) was signed in Tokyo on the 17th July 2018. \u00a0The European Parliament and Japan's National Diet voted to ratify the EPA in December 2018 and the Agreement entered into force on 1st February 2019. \u00a0The Agreement provides for tariff reductions to be delivered on a phased basis over a period of up to 15 years.\u00a0 It will open up new opportunities for Irish exporters and companies across a wide range of sectors, including the agri-food sector, which will see particular benefits with new access for dairy products and beef. \u00a0It will also facilitate greater ease in doing business in the financial services, med-tech, and green energy sectors and across the full range of trade interests that Ireland and Japan share. \u00a0The Agreement also creates opportunities for Irish-based manufacturers in our pharmaceutical sector through an expansion of existing Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing Practice to cover new pharmaceutical products.<\/p>  <p>  EU-Singapore - The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed by the EU and Singapore at the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit on 19th October 2018. \u00a0The FTA was ratified by the European Parliament on 12th   February 2019. \u00a0The aim is for the FTA to enter into force during 2019. \u00a0The deal goes beyond many previously negotiated free trade accords in committing to open up public procurement, an area where the EU and Ireland has many leading suppliers, and agreeing on technical standards in areas such as motor vehicles, electronics and green technologies.\u00a0 Irish-owned SMEs are developing strong trade links with Singapore and this trade is growing steadily. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  EU-Vietnam &ndash; An FTA was successfully negotiated with Vietnam in 2015. \u00a0The European Commission and Vietnam signed the deal on the 30th   June 2019 in Hanoi. \u00a0The hope is that it will be ratified by the European Parliament during 2019. \u00a0The EU-Vietnam FTA will eliminate over 99% of tariffs and will unlock a market with huge potential for Irish exports. \u00a0The FTA will also create opportunities by addressing other barriers to trade and will address trade-related areas such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, and sustainable development. \u00a0The Agreement creates opportunities for the Irish Agri-food sector, in particular. Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years and the FTA will support further growth. \u00a0There are opportunities for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood, and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA. \u00a0Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will be eliminated under the FTA. The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers.<\/p>  <p>  EU-Mexico - On the 21st   April 2018, the EU and Mexico announced that they had reached Political Agreement in their negotiations to modernise the existing EU-Mexico Global Agreement to broaden its scope to include regulatory cooperation, more trade in agriculture and food, common phytosanitary standards (food safety and animal and plant health), sustainable development, rules of origin, public procurement. \u00a0The EU and Mexico hope to finalise the full legal text before the end of the year. \u00a0The final text will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;. \u00a0After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature. \u00a0The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, this will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and beef products. \u00a0Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives. \u00a0There are also many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including in the automotive, aeronautics, electronics, financial and telecommunications sector.<\/p>  <p>  EU-Mercosur - The EU recently reached political agreement in their negotiations with the Mercosur region (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay). \u00a0The EU-Mercosur Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date. \u00a0The Agreement covers a population of over 770 million with trade in goods and services valued at &euro;122 billion. \u00a0It aims to reduced and, in some areas, eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region. \u00a0In 2018, Ireland exported &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region. \u00a0In 2017 &ndash; the latest year for which data is available &ndash; services exports to Mercosur totalled almost &euro;1.5 billion. \u00a0Trade with this region has grown by 19% in the period 2010 to 2016. \u00a0The EU-Mercosur Agreement will, we anticipate, allow Irish exporters to expand faster, and will open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy. \u00a0This Agreement will see a significant reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region.\u00a0 The EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement will make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish products. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from Debates in this House before the summer Recess, the TRQ agreed in respect of beef is more than we would have wished for.\u00a0 Equally, there was much debate about the environmental sustainability elements of the Agreement.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The final text of the Agreement will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo; and translated into the various EU and Mercosur languages. \u00a0After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature - a process we believe will take 2 years based on previous FTAs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to a full independent economic impact analysis, and to an environmental impact assessment of the deal, in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>EU-Australia - Negotiations for an FTA with Australia commenced in July 2018. \u00a0Four rounds of negotiations have been held with the most recent taking place 1st-5th July 2019. \u00a0The fifth round is scheduled to take place the week commencing the 14th October.\u00a0 Good progress has been made across many areas to date, however, more challenging discussions are also anticipated on sensitive issues such as recognition of the EU&rsquo;s Geographic Indicators for food and beverages, and in finding agreement on the structure of tariff offers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  EU-New Zealand &ndash; Negotiations for an FTA with New Zealand also commenced in 2018. To date there have been four rounds of negotiations with the most recent taking place from 13th-17th May 2019 in Wellington. Overall, progress has been constructive with some chapters capable of being closed and the negotiation continuing with the date of the next round yet to be agreed.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  EU-Chile &ndash; Negotiations for a trade agreement with Chile were launched in November 2017. \u00a0There have been four rounds of discussions to date, the latest taking place in Santiago de Chile 1&ndash; 5 April 2019. Over the course of the round the negotiating teams discussed all the issues covered by the Agreement. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  EU- Indonesia - The first FTA negotiations with Indonesia took place in September 2016. \u00a0The eighth round of negotiations took place in Jakarta from 17th-21st   June 2019. \u00a0The negotiations are approximately at the half-way point. \u00a0Good progress has been made in a number of areas, however, more challenging discussions lie ahead.\u00a0 The ninth round of negotiations is expected to be held in early December 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to EU-US discussion on trade, on the 25th July 2018, European Commission President Juncker and President Trump met in Washington to launch a new phase in the close friendship and strong trade relations between the United States and the European Union.\u00a0 They agreed a Joint EU-US Statement to:<\/p>  <p>  -  work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies (on non-auto industrial goods) and to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans,<\/p>  <p>  -  strengthen strategic energy cooperation to potentially increase US imports of (LNG) to diversify the EU&rsquo;s energy supply,<\/p>  <p>  -  launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs, and<\/p>  <p>  -  work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity.<\/p>  <p>  An EU-US Executive Working Group (EWG), was established on foot of the July joint statement, co-chaired by EU Trade Commissioner Cecelia Malmstr&ouml;m and the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as the vehicle for carrying forward this joint agenda.\u00a0 The EWG has met over a dozen occasions most recently in New York on 24th   September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  On 15th April 2019, the EU Council voted by qualified majority to approve the negotiating directives for the commencement of trade negotiations with the US in the sectors of conformity assessment and the removal of tariffs on industrial goods.\u00a0 The approval of the negotiating directives was a key step on the road to a possible future limited trade agreement between the EU and US.<\/p>  <p>  On 25th July 2019 the European Commission released a progress report &ndash; available on the DG Trade website - on the work of the EWG in delivering on the EU-US Joint Statement July 2018. Entitled &ldquo;Greater together: Slashing billions in industrial tariffs and boosting transatlantic trade&rdquo;, this is the second progress report since the formation of the EWG.\u00a0 The report underlines the fact that there has been concrete progress made in EU-US trading relationship in the areas of conformity assessment (full implementation of the Mutual Recognition Agreement on Pharmaceuticals) and cooperation on increasing EU purchasing of US soya beans.\u00a0 There have also been positive conversations around medical devices and cybersecurity.\u00a0 While these areas of progress are encouraging, no progress had been achieved in the area of Industrial Goods. The USTR has made clear to Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m that the US will not engage on this strand as a future deal will not be acceptable to Congress, without Agriculture being included.\u00a0 The relevant EU Negotiating Directive, or mandate, drawn up in accordance with the July 2018 agreement between the US and EU Commission Presidents, makes clear that Agriculture is not comprehended by the discussions. \u00a0Therefore, progress on Conformity Assessment is certainly more achievable, but more engagement with the US is required.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  US &ldquo;Section 232&rdquo; tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU remain in place.\u00a0 Additionally, President Trump delayed by 6 months, to November 2019, the imposition of tariffs on automotive and automotive parts imports from the EU to allow US trade officials to attempt to negotiate a solution to what the US sees as a matter of national security &ndash; that is, that the importation of autos and auto-parts is a threat to US national security, a position the EU cannot accept. \u00a0While the US has signalled its view the commencement of a new EU Commission term in November 2019 is an opportunity to re-engage on trade matters, the EU have been clear that there is no mandate from Member States to revisit the existing Negotiating Directives to discuss agriculture. <\/p>  <p>  While the position of both parties regarding agriculture remains a barrier to significant progress in terms of negotiating an agreement on industrial goods, there has been progress both through the aforementioned EWG and the recent renegotiation of the &ldquo;Hilton&rdquo; Beef quota between the EU and US. \u00a0This agreement does not change the overall volume, quality or safety of beef imported into the EU; rather it allocates a larger share of the WTO quota (35,000 tonnes out of a total of 45,000 tonnes) to the United States, phased in over a period of 7 years.\u00a0 The quota was an interim solution put in place some years ago to address a longstanding dispute between the EU and the US regarding the EU&rsquo;s ban on the importation of hormone beef into the EU.\u00a0 This agreement regarding the redistribution of the Hilton Quota is the result of considerable negotiations between all interested countries.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s Question regarding proposed duties on EU imports, these relate to cases where both the EU and the US have been found at fault by the WTO in relation to providing certain subsidies to their aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, respectively.\u00a0 In that regard, the WTO this week published their Arbitration findings in the Airbus case which effectively authorised the US to apply retaliatory measures up to the value of $7.5 billion annually against the EU.\u00a0 As this dispute relates to the aircraft manufacturing sector, the primary target for US remedial tariffs would be aircraft manufacturing, however, the US can apply retaliatory measures to a wider range of goods exported by EU Member States.<\/p>  <p>  As International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties, the EU Commission takes the lead on this issue taking into account the views of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.\u00a0 Therefore, Ireland continues to be engaged with the Commission, both at a Ministerial and Official level on these issues. Indeed, as recently as Tuesday of this week, I attended the EU Council of Trade Ministers&rsquo; meeting in Brussels where, among other items, EU Ministers discussed our concerns on these Aircraft cases and I articulated Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns.\u00a0 In that regard, the European Commission has consistently communicated to the US that the EU is ready to work with them to agree on a fair and balanced solution for our respective aircraft industries.\u00a0 As recently as this July, the EU shared concrete proposals with the US for a new regime on aircraft subsidies, and a way forward on existing compliance obligations on both sides, to avoid a round of tit-for-tar tariffs as the EU will have a similar option against the US in some 6\/9 months when an Arbitrator determines the quantum of damage to EU industry US subsidies to Boeing has caused. So far, regretfully, the US has not engaged. Nonetheless, Ireland&rsquo;s preference, as I and my Government colleagues as well as my officials have articulated, along with the EU, is for a negotiated settlement to be reached on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Initial analysis by my Department of the US list of products on which it proposes to apply tariffs on foot of the Airbus Arbitration findings published this week is that Irish exporters of certain cheese products, pork products, butter and Irish Cream Liqueurs will be subject to additional import duties of 25%. \u00a0On the other hand, despite earlier lists published by the US, Irish Whiskey appears not to be included among the current measures.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as industry and its Enterprise Agencies in relation to the implications for Irish business of the US proposals here. \u00a0In parallel, Government has highlighted our concerns in bilateral engagements with US interlocuters in Dublin and Washington, intensively over recent months. The issue of the tariffs was also raised during the US Presidential and Vice-Presidential visits this year.\u00a0 I and my officials, as well as colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, continue in contact with our US counterparts in Dublin and Washington on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Our position remains that the mutual imposition of sanctions will only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.\u00a0 Ireland does not want to see this escalation at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300051#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300051#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[40443\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300051#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if changes to EU State aid rules as a policy lever to support exposed firms and exports from a no-deal Brexit were discussed at the EU Competitiveness Council meeting in Brussels; and if not, the reason Ireland did not raise the issue.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>My colleague Minister Breen attended the most recent Competitiveness Council meeting on 26th September 2019.\u00a0 State Aid rules did not feature on the agenda of this meeting.

However, the Council noted that cost pressures are evident in some areas including the labour market, credit, business services and residential property. <\/p>  <p>  Examining our price level index, an indicator of aggregate prices relative to the EU average that is deflated by GDP, Ireland had the 5th highest prices in the European Union, behind Denmark, Finland, Luxemburg and Sweden. In 2018, Ireland&rsquo;s purchasing power parities price level index was 13.3 percent higher than the EU average. Nevertheless, prices in Ireland increased by 0.7% in 2018, which was markedly lower than the European Union inflation average of 1.9%.<\/p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) plays an important institutional role ensuring that the Government has an independent voice raising important competitiveness and productivity issues. Under the Council&rsquo;s Terms of Reference, it is required to prepare two annual reports:<\/p>  <p>  - An annual report benchmarking the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s business sector against international peer countries; and,<\/p>  <p>  - An annual report outlining the main competitiveness challenges facing the business sector in Ireland over the medium term, and the policy responses required to meet them.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside these reports, they also produce a Cost of Doing Business report, a Productivity Statement, and a series of shorter competitiveness bulletins. As the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am responsible for presenting the findings of the NCC&rsquo;s competitiveness documents to the Taoiseach and the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness remains a key priority for the Government. We continue to monitor Ireland's cost base and to analyse the factors that are crucial to improving our competitiveness. A range of initiatives are in process across Departments to: enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity; improve the ease of doing business; reduce the administrative burden businesses face; and, drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base. <\/p>  <p>  Significantly, in March 2019, Future Jobs Ireland was launched, a cross-government framework designed to improve our economy&rsquo;s resilience in the face of emerging and future challenges. It sets out 26 &lsquo;ambitions&rsquo; to 2025 across five pillars in the areas of innovation; productivity; skills and talent; participation; and transitioning to a low carbon economy. This initiative has proposed concrete and ambitious actions to enhance our productivity and competitiveness in order to ensure that we are well positioned to adapt to transformational changes the economy will face in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  A range of specific deliverables in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 aim to enhance the business environment and improve competitiveness, as well as other factors, that contribute to specific sectoral cost challenges. For example:<\/p>  <p>  - On credit and financial costs, the Future Growth Loan Scheme will provide long term debt financing for strategic investments at competitive rates in a post-Brexit environment;<\/p>  <p>  - On legal services, new business models for legal services will be introduced, including new legal partnerships and limited liability partnerships;<\/p>  <p>  - On construction, an implementation plan for actions to stimulate construction sector productivity will be delivered, including greater deployment of Building Information Modelling.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing productivity is the only long-term sustainable way of increasing the standard of living for our people, and there are a range of further initiatives underway across Government to enhance productivity, including:<\/p>  <p>  - The review of SME policy designed to assess the SME business ecosystem and the range of supports offered to SMEs undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the OECD; and<\/p>  <p>  - The development of an Industry 4.0 strategy to respond to the challenges and opportunities arising from the impact of digital technologies.<\/p>  <p>  As a small open economy, we must never underestimate the importance of maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring that the cost of doing business does not impede this. In this regard, the actions outlined form an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s over-arching plan for the future of the Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300051#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300051#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[40482\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300051#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of food businesses that have applied for working capital under the Brexit loan scheme which opened in March 2018 up until the end of quarter 3 2019; the number of such businesses that have been sanctioned financing to date; and the value of same.","asker":"1244","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The Brexit Loan Scheme provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are or will be Brexit impacted and which meet the scheme criteria.\u00a0 The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Given its significant exposure to the UK market, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contributed 40% of the State funding.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p><p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p><p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p><p>This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. <\/p><p>The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p><p>The CMO's Report makes 19 recommendations including:<\/p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;<\/p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;<\/p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;<\/p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;<\/p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and<\/p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.<\/p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. <\/p><p>The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July 2018 to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.<\/p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group was convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations which included three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. <\/p><p>I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed by the HSE. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. <\/p><p>Pending the completion of this work, I am informed that work to identify and progress service options for women with immediate or urgent needs is nearing completion. <\/p><p>As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019. <\/p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that a further detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. <\/p><p>I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.<\/p><p>At my meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.

The EREP is the successor to the Environmental Drainage Maintenance or EDM Programme, involving a series of shared studies by OPW and IFI.    The EREP, as with the EDM, has undergone significant development and transformation during the period since its inception in 2008. The Shared Service Agreement of 2018 set out a priority, within EREP, of an essential greater focus on scientific investigations within an emphasis on Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The investigations undertaken in 2018 covered a range of issues, completing a detailed 2-year examination of fish, habitat and barriers in the Inny catchment, continuing a programme of long-term monitoring of sites previously examined in the 1990s, examining options for OPW in regard to management of old channel meanders and of gravel traps among other priorities. <\/p>  <p>  The Shared Service Agreement identified that a number of proposals could be examined annually within EREP in the context of river enhancement. It was also agreed by OPW and IFI that, in line with the WFD, the status of any waterbody where river enhancement works might be proposed would be assessed in advance of undertaking any works. <\/p>  <p>  Waterbody status is assessed under WFD and an Ecological Quality Ratio or EQR is allocated. This is a WFD management process and the EQR identifies if a waterbody is in HIGH, GOOD, MODERATE, POOR or BAD status.

The Agreement identified that detailed EQR data would be collected for fish community and for habitat in any waters where works were being proposed, in advance of any determination to proceed. <\/p>  <p>  It is, therefore, a priority that the scientific evidence gathering process, underpinning proposed works, should be advanced and completed before any determination on proceeding with works is finalised.

However, the Excellence in Energy Efficient Design (EXEED) grant scheme can be applied to any investment project where energy is a factor.

In its Action Plan published in July 2019, the Government acknowledged that a no deal Brexit will be highly disruptive and will have profound implications across all aspects of society. It will be impossible for the UK to maintain the current seamless arrangements with the EU across the full range of sectors including transport connectivity, trade flows and supply chains. The contingency plans in place, including in the transport sector, will mitigate but cannot eliminate the impacts of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p><p>The re-introduction of customs or border controls as a consequence of Brexit will undoubtedly increase transit times for all traffic travelling via or from the UK to Continental Europe, including for many Irish importers and exporters. <\/p><p>The three locations for which Ireland is heavily dependent on connectivity to the UK are Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort. \u00a0The Office of Public Works has worked across Government with relevant agencies and Departments in delivering the required facilities for these agriculture, health and customs checks at these locations. Temporary facilities are now in place to meet the needs of these agencies. Additional staffing in Customs, Agriculture and Health have been recruited and trained to provide the necessary support and to manage the efficient movement of freight and people through these locations. \u00a0<\/p><p>The necessary associated staffing and IT systems are also in place. Testing of the relevant IT systems is continuing. Communications with stakeholders is ongoing and will continue during October 2019.<\/p><p>Trade between Port of Cork, Shannon Foynes Port Company and UK is more limited and is not exposed to the implications of Brexit in the same way as Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort. However, both ports have also been contingency planning for Brexit, including planning for any opportunities that may arise.\u00a0 While Shannon Foynes handles no LoLo or RoRo presently, I am aware that as part of their expansion plans and Brexit contingency planning, the Port is currently examining the viability of new direct container services from Foynes to Europe. Opportunities for new routes are also being explored on an ongoing basis by Irish Ports with other European Ports and shipping companies.

Currently only childminders who care for 4 or more children of preschool age, or, 7 or more children including those of school age, can register with Tusla and therefore take part in State subsidy schemes. To address this limitation while protecting children and providing assurance of the quality of childminding provision, First 5 - the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2018-2028 - committed to extend regulation to all other paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis over the lifetime of First 5. <\/p>  <p>  The Draft Action Plan proposes that in Phase 2 of the Action Plan an amendment to the\u00a0Child Care Act 1991 would enable registration with\u00a0Tusla - and therefore participation in the National Childcare Scheme - by all paid, non-relative\u00a0childminders who meet initial qualification and regulatory requirements that would be determined during Phase 1 of the Action Plan. While I am keen for this step to be taken at the earliest possible opportunity, it will be important that this step is only taken when preparations are complete, including: when new\u00a0Regulations are in place that are proportionate and appropriate to the home setting in which childminders work; when the Tusla Inspectorate is ready to register and inspect all non-relative childminders; and when more detailed costings have been completed on the budgetary implications for the National Childcare Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Draft Action Plan estimates that Phase 2 costs, including all of the reforms outlined in the plan, could be in the region of between &euro;27m and &euro;58m based on two scenarios of either 5,000\u00a0or 10,000 childminders registering with Tusla and becoming eligible for participation in the National Childcare Scheme. The costs are related to both early learning and care and school-age childcare.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, there would be offsetting savings, principally through increased labour market participation as a result of wider access for parents to National Childcare Scheme subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the costing the Action Plan is challenging given considerable uncertainty about the number of childminders currently working in the country, and the number of\u00a0childminders who would remain in the sector following the introduction of regulations. This uncertainty impacts on estimates of the number of additional children and families who would be able to access the new National Childcare Scheme subsidies.

All three objectives - access, affordability and quality - are critical to parents and children and one impacts on the other, hence a comprehensive response is required.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of affordability, the numbers of children benefitting from State supported early learning and care and school age childcare in Ireland has doubled since 2015.\u00a0Free preschool provided under the ECCE Programme has increased from one year to two, saving working parents &euro;5,000 over the two years. This Programme benefits over 100,000 children annually. There have been significant increases in subsidies for families on lower incomes, rising from &euro;95 per child per week in\u00a0 2016 to as much as &euro;145 per child per week from 2017. A new universal subsidy for under threes was also introduced in 2017 totalling &euro;1040 per annum.

On its introduction, the NCS will ensure that families on NET household incomes of less than &euro;60,000 will receive some type of subsidy, with those on less than &euro;26,000 (NET) receiving the maximum subsidy which is as much as &euro;200 per child per week.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD has compared the supports for early learning and care and school-age childcare previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the NCS. For a lone parent working, net costs in Ireland in 2015 were the highest among all OECD countries ( and second highest for couples). The OECD estimated that NCS will bring net costs down to make Ireland only the 11th highest in the OECD for lone parents, or closer to the OECD average.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300061#WRR03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":869,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300061#WRR03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Regeneration and Development Fund","counter":868,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300061#WRR03200"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[40199\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300061#WRR03300","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the status of the rural regeneration development fund; the status of an application (details supplied); when successful projects will be announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":870,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Rural Regeneration and Development Fund seeks to support ambitious and strategic projects which have the potential to transform rural economies and communities.

For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 14.7% in\u00a0August 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department is finalising a review on the impacts of the reduced rates on young jobseekers which I will be reviewing shortly.\u00a0 This is a complex and detailed piece of work which also examined the research undertaken by the National University of Maynooth into effectiveness of\u00a0the introduction of reduced\u00a0JA rates\u00a0payable to\u00a0young jobseekers aged 18 and 19.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the\u00a0age related rates of payment of\u00a0JA\u00a0would also have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this\u00a0clarifies the matter for the Deputy at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300062#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Money Advice and Budgeting Service","counter":919,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300062#WRS02700"},{"type":"question","counter":920,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[40320\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019100300062#WRS02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the 2020 funding allocation for the dedicated mortgage arrears service has been decided; if so, if this decision has been communicated to the Citizens Information Board and the eight regional Money Advice and Budgeting Service companies operating the programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":921,"content":"<p>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, (CIB) provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.
