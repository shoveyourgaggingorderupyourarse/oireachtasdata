My strong impression at the time was that, in general, Deputies are very supportive of the legislation and want to see it enacted as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  This is a landmark first step to strengthen and transform the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement into a statutory and independent agency.  The Bill puts a strong framework in place for the new corporate enforcement authority and places it on a firm footing so that it can hit the ground running.<\/p> <p>  There is also a serious Government commitment that the new authority will have all the necessary human resources required, both Civil Service and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to pursue breaches of company law.  The views of the director were sought, and arising from his assessment, the necessary steps have been taken to ensure the new authority will have effectively a 50% increase in headcount.  There will be more steps to take in future to continue to enhance the powers of the authority such as through the actions arising from the Hamilton implementation plan.  We will keep resourcing under constant review.<\/p> <p>  I hope we will have the continued support of Deputies and Senators as we proceed through the two Houses of the Oireachtas.

We have discussed this previously.  The amendment I proposed has been ruled out of order, but I ask that the Minister of State would give some consideration to the evidence provided in a written submission by Professor Deirdre Ahern.  She maintains it is not good practice for a one-person authority to exist and that we should be moving towards what she suggests, which is a minimum of two and an upper limit of five.  My amendment was ruled out of order because there is a charge on the Exchequer, but it is open to the Minister to bring forward an amendment himself to address this.  I am still a bit lost as to the reason for proceeding as outlined in the Bill.  I do not think any of us would believe that one person alone is sufficient.  A minimum of two and an upper limit of five is very reasonable.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make one point on audits in co-operatives and how they relate to the Bill.  We know audits can be very expensive.  They range in cost between &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000.  They take up huge resources and can take a considerable amount of time.  They will cause a problem for co-operatives in particular.  It is my intention to bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage to deal with that.  I want to flag that to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate my amendment was ruled out of order, but I still think there is merit in it.  I would welcome the views of the Minister of State on the idea that an authority with one person is enough.  We should consider having a minimum of two persons with an upper limit of five, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#A01000","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly for tabling her amendment.<\/p><p>My officials and I gave careful consideration to the report of the joint committee on this Bill, which arose from pre-legislative scrutiny, as well as the view that there should be more members on the new authority.  Specifically, there should be a minimum of two, up to a maximum of five or six, as in Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment.  As it stands, the section provides for up to three full-time members.  It is designed to give the scope to structure the authority to meet the different demands of its remit, which includes investigation, prosecution, supervision and advocacy along clear lines of responsibility.  The idea is to give flexibility.  If a number of big cases arise at the same time, the new authority would be able to have an additional one or two members to work with the chairperson.  The number of members of the authority has been assessed and has been deemed proportionate and appropriate in the medium term.  However, the scope is there to raise the number up to three.  That is comparable in scale of operations with other agencies, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  <\/p><p> The Minister sought the views of director and his assessment, in summary, was that a maximum of three persons is proportionate to the scale of the organisation in terms of assignment of responsibility to members and ratio of members to staff.  We are satisfied, therefore, that under the legislation there is the opportunity to increase the number of members.  While it is being established now solely with one chairperson, it is our feeling that that number will increase over time.  However, according to the director&rsquo;s assessment, the number is proportionate.  There is the option to raise the number up to three into the future, if the workload increases and it is deemed necessary.  If that is the case, we would not have any hesitation in raising it at that stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#A01100","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>My difficulty is not so much with the upper limit of three; it is with the floor, rather with the ceiling.

The Chair might have missed him.  The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the duration that a person can act up from six months to eight weeks.  It is reasonable that somebody should act up.  Acting up happens all the time.  People find themselves indisposed, or whatever, and there is a need to have someone acting up.  However, it is bad practice to have someone acting up for six months.  Eight weeks is a much more reasonable timeframe.  Acting up should, by any definition, not be long term.  In my opinion, six months is fairly long term.  Eight weeks is sufficient time to allow any period of acting up, given that it is supposed to be a temporary situation.  It is not supposed to be long term.  Acting up puts the staff member in an unenviable position.  They are effectively in the position without all of the authority, when the person who is acting up is not the person in the role.  <\/p><p>There is also confusion over how they are going to operate while they are acting up.  Does all of the authority vest in them?  Are they acting up for the purposes?  Will they receive an acting up allowance for the full duration?  Will there have to be an extension?  Does it have to be an extended period in order for them to get it?  I am concerned primarily with the idea that we would put on a legal footing the six-month period as an accepted definition of short-term acting up.  Short-term acting up is up to eight weeks.  Anything beyond that is longer-term and falls out of the scope of acting up.  <\/p><p>I am aware that within the civil and public service for all sorts of reasons, primarily the recruitment ban that was implemented a number of years ago, acting up went out of control.  That is probably the best description.  Everybody was acting up at one point.  There were large numbers acting up, certainly within the public service, because of the ban on promotions.  It was generally agreed at the time that it is not a good idea for acting up to go on for a long time.  Acting up should be short term.  It should be only for emergencies.  Eight weeks is enough time for contingencies to be made.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#B00900","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Did Deputy Bruton want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#B01000","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>It was about the section, rather than the amendment, so will I wait to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#B01100","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Yes.

I am supportive of the principle underpinning the amendment, which is to minimise the periods in which members would act up.  However, unforeseen circumstances can arise, which suddenly cause a vacancy.  The vacancies must be temporarily filled.  Ideally, we would all love a situation where adequate notice and a lead-in time are given to carry out a recruitment campaign.  However, sicknesses, even sudden death, or other unforeseen circumstances can occur.  The six-month maximum period is a standard provision for authorising an acting member and it is a realistic timeframe for the appointment process for such a senior post.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will be aware that section 944F sets out the rules for the appointment of members to the authority.  Recruitment selection is by way of open competition run by the Public Appointment Service, PAS.  Members are subsequently appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on foot of the recommendation made by the PAS.  The six-month period takes into account the practical matters of advertising the vacant position, giving applicants time to submit their application, shortlisting and interviews, and any notice period that the successful candidate will have to serve.  It is not unusual in such a senior position that a preferred candidate may have to give up to three months&rsquo; notice to transfer from his or her current employer.  Given that notice period, along with the period to run a successful competition through the PAS, which takes time, we felt at six months was a fair timeframe to put in place. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my objective is that any temporary authorisations are of the shortest  timeframe, pending an open competition.  However, we cannot accept the amendment to reduce the timeframe to eight weeks, purely on practical grounds.  Running a successful competition through the PAS in itself would take probably more than eight weeks.  The successful candidate, having been offered the position, may have to give up to three months&rsquo; notice to his or her current employer.<\/p><p>Perhaps the initial candidate might not even accept the position and it will be necessary to offer it to somebody else.  We believe that six months is the outer limit.  That is not what we want to achieve.  We do not want somebody to be acting up for six months.  We want to provide a realistic timeframe for how long it might take.  Obviously, the intention would be to keep the acting up requirement as short as possible.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked a specific question about the powers that would be associated with an acting up position.  He or she would retain the full powers.  The person would be acting up and would have the powers that would be there for somebody who is appointed on a permanent basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#B01300","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I accept that.  The Minister of State's clarification is welcome.  It is good to know that he will be keeping a close eye on this.  With regard to the powers the person has, it is tough for someone who is acting up to have all the authority because he or she is only in the position on an acting basis, if the Minister of State knows what I mean.  There is nothing specific in the legislation about this, but I would welcome the Minister of State's thoughts on backfilling positions.  Very often, when a person acts up, he or she does not act up 100% in the role and still retains some of his or her previous duties.  I am conscious that these are very important jobs for which a focus would be required and I wonder if there might be something the Minister of State could do about insisting on a backfill for a person who is acting up.  I accept what he is saying about the length of time, but the fear would be that while the six months is put in as the upper limit, it could end up as a target rather than the outlier.  That is my main concern about that.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State will keep an eye on it.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister of State comment on backfilling a position so that the person involved can actually act up 100%?  I know of many cases where a person has been asked to act up but where he or she was not fully able to give up his or her previous duties, so he or she ended up trying to do both jobs and did neither successfully.  These are important roles at a very senior level.  The Minister of State has almost made my point for me in saying that it could take up to three months because of the level of responsibility these people will have.  The level they are at could require three months to fill the vacancy on the basis that they may have to give notice and so forth.  I accept that, but, equally, there must be some support in respect of backfilling those posts for the persons concerned.  I am not sure that it is appropriate for legislation, but I would welcome the Minister of State's views.  Perhaps he would put on the record what the intention would be with regard to funding backfill and so forth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#C00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>First, the acting up is to take account of unforeseen circumstances.  The ideal situation is that the person would give the required notice and that the notice period would facilitate a seamless transition, but one can never guarantee that in life.

It is not a minimum period but very much the outer limit, and we hope it will never come to that.<\/p> <p>  The backfill is something that will have to be assessed at the time it arises; it is not something that we can legislate for today.  However, I can make one point.  Thankfully, due to the additional resources that have been allocated to the new corporate enforcement authority, with an increase of 50% in the head count, at least now we have a much better resourced and equipped body in terms of both financial resources and key personnel.  It is going to be much stronger and it will have the ability to take account of unforeseen circumstances.

I do not know what the benefit is.  I am sorry, that is not quite true as I can see that there might be a benefit to the person who is being anonymised, but I do not know what the broader benefit is.  The idea is that a person cannot be named because it might jeopardise the stability of financial markets or where it would cause disproportionate damage to the relevant director.  This is not afforded to people.  We are talking about individuals who have committed offences, which could be very serious in some instances.

I do not want to take the route of saying that if somebody committed a petty crime by going into Dunnes Stores and taking a packet of biscuits the person's name would end up in the newspaper, because we all know that.  I want to be proportionate and do like-for-like comparisons, but I cannot think of any scenario whereby a person would be allowed to have his or her details anonymised, much as the person might not wish to have his or her name in the public domain.

First, from a technical perspective arising from the repeal of chapter 3 of Part 15, section 10 of this Bill will insert a new chapter 3A and chapter 3B into Part 15 of the Companies Act 2014.  Chapter 3B, sections 944Z, and 944AA to AH,  re-enact sections 957AA, 957B to 957I, when section 3 repeals all of chapter 3 of the Companies Act 2014.  The sections and paragraphs proposed for deletion are not new law.  They arise as a consequence of the repeal of chapter 3 and they are just being renumbered to the sections in the Companies Act 2014.  It is nothing new but a renumbering and a technical requirement in terms of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Second, this is law as a consequence of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations as an EU member state to take account of EU law from 2014 on statutory audit, first in 2016 by way of a statutory instrument and, subsequently, in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018.<\/p> <p>  The sections themselves transpose the requirements of the EU Audit Directive of 2014 to introduce administrative sanctions, including financial sanctions on directors of public-interest entities who are found, following investigation, to have contributed to a breach of statutory audit rules by a statutory auditor.  Public-interest entities are banks, insurance undertakings and listed entities.  The sanctions include directions to directors to cease conduct or prohibit them from carrying out certain functions as well as financial sanctions.<\/p> <p>  The audit directive sets out in detail the rules and requirements for the imposition of sanctions on directors in keeping with the principle of proportionality inherent in EU law.  As a rule, details of sanctions on directors should be published as soon as practicable.  However, the audit directive, which we have transposed word for word, requires that member states shall ensure that sanctions on directors are published anonymously, in certain circumstances.  The circumstances are limited to where the authority is of the opinion that it would be disproportionate or would cause disproportionate damage to the director or would jeopardise the stability of financial markets or an ongoing criminal investigation.  I wish to point out that it would be the director of the new corporate enforcement authority to determine that, and not the person in question, to seek anonymity.  These circumstances, that were originally in section 957F(3), are re-enacted in sections 944AE(3) in the Bill, which the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would delete.  Failure to re-enact these provisions would mean that Ireland would be in breach of its EU obligations.  It is for this reason that I oppose the amendment and I hope that I have clarified the purpose of the sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#D00200","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said that the director would determine anonymity, which is fair enough.

Can a director seek anonymity but ultimately the decision to grant it or otherwise is only given by the director?  Obviously the director can decide to grant anonymity where deemed appropriate.  Is he saying that the director is precluded from asking?  What I heard is that only the director of the authority can decide anonymity and there is no capacity for the company directors to seek anonymity.

This provision offers directors protections above and beyond what would normally be expected where a person commits a transgression.

It seems a little incongruous that this provision is in the same section on the how the anonymity of a person's reputation would be damaged.

Anyway, here goes.  The amendment is similar to the Deputy's previous one.  Section 944AF, which is proposed for deletion, is not new law.  It is in keeping with the principle of proportionality.  The EU audit directive requires the level of administrative sanctions imposed to take into account circumstances such as the financial strength of the director, the gravity and duration of the breach by the director and the degree of responsibility.  These circumstances were originally in section 957D(2) and re-enacted in section 944AC(2).<\/p> <p>  In addition, legal advice at the time of drafting the original provisions in 2016 was that other proportionality considerations should be introduced in respect of financial sanctions, and specifically that the sanction should not cause a director to become bankrupt.  This is set out in section 944AF(1) re-enacting section 957G(1).  The concern was that, in the absence of this safeguard, financial sanctions imposed under these sections could be vulnerable to challenge in the courts.<\/p> <p> Ireland is required to maintain section 944AC(2) to comply with its EU obligations.  If section 944AF is proposed to be amended, the views of the Attorney General would have to be sought on the impact on the principle of proportionality.  We all want to ensure that directors who break the law are brought to account but we need to ensure that the law is robust and not at risk of challenge.  The section gets the balance right, and for this reason I do not propose to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021101900002#E00200","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The Minister of State referred to the principle of proportionality, but the protection afforded to company directors in this instance is entirely disproportionate.

I am concerned that the measure could act as a deterrent.  A company director could say that if there were sanctions, he or she would end up bankrupt, and that they should not be imposed as a consequence.  That is serious.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the legislation involves the transposition of pre-existing legislation to a large extent but I would be grateful to hear from the Minister of State about how many times the clause in question has been used to ensure financial sanctions would not be imposed.

It would be a normal sort of thing to put into the functions, although there is a possibility for the Minister to ask for such advice.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the comment made by Deputy O'Reilly earlier, there are different types of authority.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, is a one-person authority for enforcement, while the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CPCC, is a three-person authority to undertake enforcement.  I understand that the CPCC ensures that expertise in different areas is brought to bear.  There is merit therefore in having a group consisting of three people with different areas of expertise but nonetheless undertaking collective decision-making.  Is the model envisaged here a one-person authority, like the DPP, or is the Minister of State considering, in the more medium term, the use of the flexibility which exists to have three members on this authority and to go for an arrangement like that which exists in the CPCC?   Like Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly, I see some merit in multiple members rather than just one and it would be interesting to hear from the Minister of State on the thinking behind the sort of model envisaged in this regard.  There are different models and I do not know when some are more satisfactory or operate better than others.<\/p> <p>  This proposed legislation is welcome.  We have missed a beat in not having an authority which is strong enough and appropriately resourced.  This Bill will be an important element in addressing that issue.

The new authority structure is similar to a commission, with a chairperson assisted by other members who have delegated responsibilities for other specific functions.  Section 944F stipulating the membership of the authority provides for up to three full-time members and it is designed to give scope to structure the authority to meet the differing demands of its remit.  These include: investigation; prosecution; supervision; and advocacy along specific lines of responsibility.  The idea is to give flexibility.<\/p> <p>  If several big cases arise at the same time, then the new authority would be able to have an additional one or two members to work with the chairperson.  The members will be full-time and appointed for a period of up to five years, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further term of up to five years.  Recruitment will be run by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  One of the members shall be appointed as the chairperson to ensure continuity between the ODCE and the new authority.  Section 944F provides that the person who is the director of that body immediately before the establishment day shall be a member of the authority unless he or she resigns, is removed, dies or otherwise vacates that office.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the appointment of additional members, my primary concern is to establish the new authority.

As I said to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, however, we have an open mind regarding the appointment of additional members when the authority is established.  A reasonable expectation therefore is that the membership will grow over time.  The primary objective now, though, is to get the new authority up and running by 1 January 2022, or certainly in January of next year, and to ensure the additional staff approved have been recruited and that the authority will be fit for purpose in future.

I strongly believe in this project and want to get the necessary legislative underpinning in place to allow for the necessary transformation.  As well as the legislation, I have been very clear that I see resources as key.  This includes relevant experts and garda&iacute;.  Since coming to office I am pleased that the Department has sanctioned the necessary Civil Service posts and that the recruitment process is under way.  Separately, I am pleased that the Garda Commissioner has agreed to a significant increase in Garda resources for the new authority.  This will support the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s vision for the new authority.  I will continue to prioritise this work and plan to see the new agency established.  With the help of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, I hope to have the necessary legislation in place over the coming weeks.  This will allow for the establishment of the authority in January 2022.  I give an undertaking that I will come back to Deputies O'Reilly and Bruton on the issues they raised.<\/p> <p>  As I have already said, this is a landmark step to strengthen and transform the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement into a statutory and independent Corporate Enforcement Agency.  I will ensure that it is equipped not just to hit the ground running, but to continue to deliver on its important objective in the enforcement of, and compliance with, the Companies Act 2014.

If any member or witness participating remotely experiences any sound or technical issue, will he or she let us know?  Otherwise, we will proceed.<\/p> <p>  I advise everybody that as this is a public meeting the chat function on MS Teams should be used only to advise participants of any technical issue or urgent matter and should not be used to make general comments or statements.  I remind members participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak, and when they are speaking I ask that, where possible, they have their cameras switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.<\/p> <p>  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside the precincts will be refused.<\/p> <p>  Members participating in the meeting from the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except, obviously, when people are speaking.  I ask for co-operation in this matter.  It would be appreciated if committee members who are participating remotely put their location into the chat function so I know who is in Leinster House for the questions and answers.<\/p> <p>  Our first session is with representatives from the Collaborative Forum and Adoption Loss-the Natural Parents Network of Ireland.  I offer a very sincere welcome to Ms Terri Harrison and Ms Alice Coughlan who are members of the Collaborative Forum and to Ms Muriel Thornton and Ms Rhoda McManus who are members of Adoption Loss-the Natural Parents Network of Ireland.  The purpose of our meeting today is to engage with them on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the birth information and tracing Bill.  I want to say to all of the witnesses appearing before the committee that their assistance to us as a committee in scrutinising the general scheme of the Bill is invaluable and very much appreciated.  We all recognise that it is not an easy task to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss such sensitive issues.  For this we are very grateful.  We genuinely mean this and we are delighted the witnesses are able to join us today.<\/p> <p>  I need to go through parliamentary privilege before the witnesses make their opening statements.  As all of the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if the witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence about a particular matter, it is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Following the delivery of the opening statements we will have questions and answers with the members.  The speaking rota has been circulated to all members in advance of the meeting.  Each member is allocated five minutes, which includes the time for answers.  I now invite Ms Harrison to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#A00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  I will go straight to early care information.  I would like an amendment made to the Bill regarding the early care of our children.  We were locked away in institutions.  Even though our babies were in the same institutions, they were locked away in nurseries.  The very early care of a child reflects its entirety of care.  People were given permission to access the locked nurseries in between feeding times, which was the only time we were allowed to care for our newborn babies.  It is essential that the early care information is accurate and that it reflects the truth of what really happened in these institutions.  The mother should have the right to know to what extent people had access to her newborn baby.  Many things transpired and we had no authority.  We were not seen as the child's mother and, therefore, we did not give the entire early care.<\/p> <p>  With regard to access to records, I want to know by whom these scribbled notes were recorded and how they reflect the truth and transparency of what really happened in these places.  It is imperative that the mother of the child is allowed to proofread such records.  Who is deemed qualified to describe us, our well-being, mental well-being and emotional state?  To give an example, the records I have witnessed from the so-called qualified authority state every pregnancy was healthy and normal and every delivery was healthy and normal.  We now have proven facts that this is untrue.  These facts are being withheld.  For all the girls who were imprisoned, the only real test on record is that they had to be seen if they had syphilis.  This was an essential test when entering these places.  Nobody ever came in to inspect the well-being of the expectant mother.  In the terminology of the Government for the past 70 years we are never described as expectant mothers or new mothers.  The early care information has to reflect on the unborn child.  It affects them also.  It has been scientifically proven that the well-being of the mother as the child lives inside of her is essential to the future of that unborn child.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see an amendment on access to counselling.  It is crucial the councillors are accredited.  The Bill states Tusla social workers will provide vital support to those who wish to avail of it.  I would definitely like to see a qualified medical practitioner put in place such as a psychologist.  We have a living bereavement brought on by an unnatural separation of mother and child.  It affects both equally for different reasons.  This is why it is vital that it is a qualified practitioner who is involved.<\/p> <p>  The contact register and the family of origin are entirely separate issues.  Every person has the birthright to know from whom they came, their culture, their heritage and their gene pool.  We have only one birth certificate and everybody is entitled to it.<\/p> <p>  I will end on a human note.  The Bill will have a profound effect on thousands in the years to come.  It is all down to legalised human trafficking and false imprisonment of mothers and their children.<\/p><p>For the sake of Irish society, I implore the committee to consider this Bill from a very deep and considered human perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Terri Harrison","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to give the committee our views on the forthcoming legislation on adoption information and tracing.  This Bill has been a long time coming, and we have made submissions on previous information and tracing Bills over the past 20 years, none of which was enacted.<\/p> <p>  Our first observation is that the very Title of the Bill betrays its presumptions upfront.  The suggestion is that it is primarily adopted people who are the seekers.  The heads of the Bill, when closely examined, show that it is of very little relevance to the many thousands of mothers, fathers and other relatives who have phoned our helpline throughout the past decades or attended our support meetings seeking our advice and assistance in contacting their adult children.<\/p> <p>  We are familiar with the complexities involved, having sat on the advisory committee appointed by the then Minister of State, Brian Lenihan, which led to the setting up of the National Information and Tracing Service by the Adoption Board in 2007.  The information leaflet about this service, containing our helpline number, was sent to every address in the State.  The calls over the following years have uncovered the harsh treatment, illegal practices and social pressures which led to the separation of mothers from their children.  We have provided the committee with one of our previous submissions which illustrates this well.<\/p> <p>  Specific to the proposed Bill, we ask the committee to consider the following.  A referendum should be held on the primacy of information rights over privacy where adoption, fostering or residential care settings have separated mothers, fathers and other relatives from their children.  The Bill should be renamed as the \"Family Information and Tracing Bill\".  Many people were not legally adopted but still require a tracing and information service.  This is about families after all - not about birth.<\/p> <p>  The legislation should grant equality to mothers and fathers in the service.  Adoption certificates should be provided to the mothers and the birth certificates to their adult children.  We understand that the names and address of the adopting parents would be redacted.  A comprehensive information leaflet should be provided to all regarding the laws on adoption and what papers may be contained within the file.  The present Tusla leaflet is a lesson in obfuscation.<\/p> <p>  As most of the social workers will have retired, the only true witness to the circumstances surrounding the separation of the child from the mother is the mother.  She should be facilitated to read her file in the presence of a social worker, who should explain the significance of particular documents.  The mother should be helped to write a statement to correct or add to the information before it is given to her adult child.  She would not be allowed to remove anything from the file.<\/p> <p>  Provision should be made for counselling assistance to the mother if the adopted person refuses to provide information to her.<\/p> <p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland should immediately trace and write to all people registered as adopted to inform them of the fact of their adoption.  At present, the laws on privacy are interpreted in such a way that apparently prevents this.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Rhoda McManus, would be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Muriel Thornton"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their submissions and for taking the time to appear before the committee today.

I would trust no one.  I would let no one control me ever again.  I would block everything that had happened from my mind.  If I ended up being the opposite of the nuns who dealt with me, I would be a good person.  I blocked everything out for 40 years.  I never married.  I worked hard.  I bought my own house.  I had one more daughter and I educated her.  I worked very hard.<\/p> <p>  About six years ago I decided I was done.  I started getting these flashbacks.  I had another operation.  I got shingles.  For the first time in about 40 years I was locked in a house on my own where I had to face my life.  I went to counselling, which I paid for.  To be totally honest, it was fine.  It helped me.  It opened up the start of what happened to me.  I went to the commission and asked for counselling from the commission.  A year to the day after I appeared before the commission, I was offered counselling, but only if I gave up my own counsellor.  I said, \"No, I'm not going to have this.\"  <\/p> <p>  Then it got to the stage where counselling was not doing anything for me.  I was getting flashbacks and other things.  After appearing before the commission, for three months I would remember something that happened to me in the convent and I would say, \"Oh God, I should have said that at the meeting.\"<\/p> <p>  Then I turned around and I went to my doctor and I went to the community mental health centre where I saw a psychologist.  This was a totally different experience for me.  First, this lady was not saying to me, \"Yes, Alice.  No, Alice.  Right, Alice.\"  I do not mean this in a wrong way; I am just saying this is what I was getting from counselling.  The psychologist was kind of hearing me or guiding me through certain things and pulling me back when I went all over the place.<\/p> <p>  To put it bluntly, for the two years I went to counselling there was not one week when I did not cry through the counselling session.  It was like a release for me if I am honest.  It is not that it did me that much good but it did give me a release.  That is the only way I can describe it.<\/p> <p>  If I was asked now what I think people need, I can honestly say they need trauma counselling with somebody who actually knows what they have gone through - a loss, this feeling that somebody has taken their soul and just thrown it into the dust, and that they are of no importance to anybody or anything.  They need somebody who is able to look at them.  They need to feel they can actually talk to someone who understands what they are saying.  That person should be able to turn around and guide them.<\/p> <p>  I believe this of every person who has gone through an institution or any form of trauma as a result of this, be it adoptees or especially survivors of mother and baby homes and other institutions.  A woman bringing children into this world afterwards is destroyed because of this and obviously it will greatly affect her children or her partner. <\/p> <p>  The other thing is that it actually helped me realise that I did not have a choice.<\/p><p>Well, I had a choice - either give my child up for adoption or that child goes into an institution until 17 years of age.  Either way, I would not be getting that child back.  That was my choice, but is that a choice?  I knew what happened in institutions.  Even in those days, people were not that silly.  We knew what happened in those places.  I have met my daughter, but there are many adopted people who actually believe that their mothers went into a convent, had them and then decided to give them away for adoption.<\/p><p> Something else I feel strongly about is the nuns writing these reports.  The nun that did this to me wrote up my information, but I am supposed to sit back and say that that was grand and she was going to be fair.  This nun walked in and gave me a new name, a new number and that advice.  That was my choice - keep my mouth shut and get on with it.  She did not say, \"Keep your mouth shut\".  She just said, \"You are not getting your child\" and that it would go for adoption and have a privileged and good upbringing.  Unfortunately, I had had a privileged upbringing, in that I had a Catholic private education, so I was twice as bad as the rest of them.  At least they had some excuse because they were not educated by the nuns, etc.<\/p><p> The main point is that they be offered advice.  I spent two years sitting in the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland listening to a social worker before I even met my daughter.  We had to go out of our way to do that.  I turned around and said, \"Hold on a minute\".  I had blocked everything out because I had been so innocent, so I spoke at my daughter.  I did not get anyone who talked to me about what to expect when meeting my daughter.  I did not get any of that, so I actually spoke at my daughter for the first year and a half, not to her, and she spoke at me.  All she could think of was that it had been the worst time of my life and she was bringing it back to me.  The last time we met, we both cried.  We decided to leave it for a few weeks and then get back together.  We are looking forward to meeting each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Coughlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Coughlan.

Our submission refers to \"deprived care\" because, from what I read in the Bill, no explanation of \"early care information\" in respect of our children was being sought.  My son would not know that I was not totally allowed to provide any such care.  That is the reason I included \"deprived care\".  It is essential that people know that my son was locked away in a nursery that was only unlocked four hours every day, that I was to be supervised while feeding him and that, after he was taken from his cot, it took me 22 years to find out if he was alive.  All of this reflects on the attitude towards early care information.  He was my son and I did not sign an adoption paper.  I tried for several years to get information from the Eastern Health Board and Tusla about where the nun took my son to from St. Patrick's on the Navan Road.  I know now that she took him back to Bessborough where I had escaped from.  How long was he in that locked nursery in Bessborough?  Given that information on the care of many of our babies is questionable, why would a Bill say that we had care of them when we did not?  I hope that has clarified for the Deputy.  For me as a human being and as Niall's mother, I would love to know what happened to my son inside and outside the institution, for example, the strangers who frequented the nursery and the pharmaceutical companies' cluster groups.  I know his record after the age of 18 years, but if I looked for information about him or where he was before that age, I was threatened with the Garda.

I will give some of my personal story.  I went back to school after my daughter was born.  I remember how, when she was a few weeks old, I went back to the adoption agency and asked to see her at Temple Hill where she had been taken.  The agency simply refused; it just said \"No\".  At that age and in that situation, one just accepts what she is told to do as an obedient girl obeying the rules of society.  Subsequently, letters that I wrote to the agency inquiring about how she was went unanswered.  This continued for years and years.<\/p> <p>  Our solution to this problem, which is reflected in the Bill, is that mothers, because they were the only witnesses to what happened, should be allowed to read the whole file and write a statement, with the help of a social worker, to fill in the gaps, including how hard it was to make contact with them and find out how they were.  As Ms Harrison and Ms Coughlan said, to simply know your child is alive is a fundamental thing, and even that was denied to us.<\/p><p>That is the nightmare we live until the time we can meet children again.  Writing this statement would also remove another fear we have which is, in some cases, adopted people are looking for pieces of paper and bits of information to fill in missing gaps.  For us, the search is about contact.  It is about an emotional need to reunite with the child to whom we gave birth and about whom we have been wondering all our lives.  Where is the child on his or her communion or confirmation?  What is the child doing on his or her birthday?  We live with this all of our lives and our fear is when we, eventually, it is hoped, get to meet the child again, this will lead to a relationship.  However, the trouble is we have had no control over what was put into that file; what was written or said about us or even things such as whether cards we wrote were put into the file.  The statement gives us a chance to reflect the reality; tell the truth; name the father, if he has not been named, and to paint our personalities, illustrate our need and, it is hoped, persuade that person to want to have a relationship with us.  That is why this statement is so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#C01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhoda MacManus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Timing is crucial and this Bill will be crucial.  Ms Thornton has requested the Bill head be changed, which we need to address.  It is worrying this is going on more than 20 years.  Everybody is getting older and children are growing up.  For me and the committee, the timing of this Bill will be crucial, as will how we make sure we get this Bill right, because, we need to do it right this time.  We have an opportunity to change things and that will happen this time.  I also want to address the comprehensive leaflet.  That is really important.

We are dealing with people who have been heartbroken and have gone through so much.  We have to make sure the counselling they receive is the proper counselling they need.  It is all about finding the right ways to make sure we address the witnesses' concerns.  I thank them and ask them to come back to me on the comprehensive leaflet and what we should be looking at in that.  All the witnesses spoke about how one gets the proper information.

We have sat with quite a number of mothers who received photocopies of the information in the file.  Many of them did not realise the significance of some of that information.  There was a woman who received her son's birth certificate, but she did not see straight off that his birth was not registered until he was six.  She had signed an adoption consent form, or so she thought, and then discovered it was a permission for her son to be boarded out, which was devastating news for her.  There needs to be somebody who is prepared to tell the truth about those documents, which these social workers do not tell.  They send out photocopies of the information, but they do not even tell you if this indicates an illegal adoption.  We have sat with a woman we were able to tell that there were signs of an illegal adoption.  The State organisation - I have to be careful here - that sent this to her, did not say in the covering letter that her son had been illegally adopted, but that was a fact.  They are not prepared to own up to the illegalities.  The reason the information needs to be so detailed is not even we, as mothers, know what might be in the file.  We do not know if anyone did write about us or wrote a report.  We do not know whether our children wrote in looking for information about us.  We know none of these things and unless there is a detailed list of what might be in the file in order that we can ask that question when we go to meet with a social worker and go through the file with her or him, it is pretty useless.

I never have received that and even in the information I got from them, none of that was included.  My daughter went in when she was 19 and was going to Australia.  The Catholic Protection &amp;amp; Rescue Society of Ireland told her it was useless and there was no way she would ever be meeting me and that was it.  It told her it did not matter, she would not be meeting me and it did not make a difference.  There were so many things.<\/p> <p>  When I got my papers, or some of my papers, from the Catholic protection society, I was 18 on one page; 19 on another and 21 on the other.  My baby was born in St. Finbarr's Hospital, which she was, but my baby was also born in Bessborough.  It was said the social worker who was in charge of the adoption came down to Cork to meet me - which never happened.  I met her one day, when the adoption papers were being signed.  One can be terribly naive.  I genuinely believed this was my choice.  My daughter, at this stage, would be brought up in an institution, rented or boarded out, or whatever you like to call it and would have a horrendous life for her first 17 years, or I could give her some form of life.  I had to believe the person who wanted to adopt really wanted a child to love and cherish.<\/p> <p>  This social worker signed her name to say she knew me very well, had met me on more than one occasion and happened to be very well known to me.  I never met the woman until five minutes before I walked from South Anne Street to Dawson Street to sign a paper.  Yet, I am expected to believe the truth and everything else is in these papers which my daughter might read or receive.

I want to reiterate the aspect of truth in records.  My abduction in the UK and being brought back here by the Catholic Crusade of Rescue is not reflected in my records, in many ways.  It would not be reflected to my son.  There was also rubber-stamping of adoption by judges where the clergy would present it.<\/p> <p>  I got my records and got access to quite a few items of correspondence in which the truth that is written is that I was a very difficult young girl.  My difficulty is not explained.  The explanation is that I would not sign any papers.  When I received a copy of my son's adoption, the person who signed my name had spelled it wrong.  What is also not on record is the fact that after returning from England, I went back  to collect my son.  I informed them that I was taking him.  He had already been adopted and they threatened me with the High Court, the police - everything.  I would like my son to know these very important details.<\/p> <p>  Ms MacManus said and I totally 100% agree that I would like to proceed without the help of any social worker.  As Ms Coughlan said, I have no trust whatsoever in authority.  I believe this belongs to the mother and the adult son or daughter and, therefore, given the choice, I would like to write a full, in-depth statement of journey of where we began when he began to grow inside me and the circumstances of living in London and being brought back to this country against my will.  Furthermore, I would like my son to know the complete journey of the lack of care while he was growing inside me, the lack of medical care after he was born and the lack of care in that I was denied to know, every night of the last 48 years, how my son is.  How is he?

If a child grows up - most of our children would be adults - and decides he or she does not wish to see his or her parent, that is his or her choice.  If a mother decides or she has not told her family or whatever the case may be and does not wish to have contact, both sides should be respected.  Both sides should have to see a psychologist regardless and actually sit down with somebody to try to go through what is going around in their heads.  There is nobody in a mother and baby institution who was not affected emotionally - in other words, destroyed emotionally.  It genuinely needs somebody who is able to get through to the mother or to the child.  The child maybe has this thing in his or her head.  Basically, we do not know how many children were told lies that their mother did this or did not want them.  We do not know how many children grew up thinking their parents or mother did not want them.  How many were a case of rape?  How many were a case of incest?  There are so many angles and so many issues, therefore, respect is needed on both sides, that is, respect for the adopted person and respect for the mothers of the babies.<\/p> <p>  Again, this idea of somebody writing one's letter is just incomprehensible.  It is just unbelievable that anyone would actually believe that somebody like a nun could actually write what happened to a person or about what way they were in those circumstances.  As I said, the big thing that gets me more than anything are half-truths.  They can just put something in that is a half-truth and, therefore, it can be made somewhat believable.  I will go back to Yvonne Murphy, the judge who turned around and asked one nun about the 38 babies.  That nun did not remember one death that occurred in her first year in the convent and yet Judge Murphy could tell her there were 38 deaths that year, and those were registered deaths.  We got this from the commission.  That is proof.

It is something we have looked at and have been talking about for 20 years.  I did not mean that the social worker would have any part in actually phrasing it but simply that he or she would act as a secretary and, maybe, because the women would be very emotional and nervous, remind her of particular aspects of her life that she might want to include or might have forgotten.

This has been talked about for decades.  The right to privacy has been used as a shield to prevent information getting out to the public.  It was really to protect the State.  That is what it was really about because if people got their information they would realise the wrongs that had been done to them.  We feel the present Attorney General has not properly explained why he now holds a different position to previous Attorneys General, in that he is saying it is possible for people to get their birth certificates.  He has never addressed the issue of our right to our child's adoption certificate but we have always felt as an organisation that there should be parity of esteem.<\/p> <p>  The way we have seen adoption is that there is a hierarchy of power and the powerless person in this was always the adopted person.  The person with less power and less agency was the natural mother and the people who had more choice were the adoptive parents.  We feel that hierarchy of rights should follow.  As we were constrained for so long and silenced for so long we think the least that can be done is for the right to information to be extended to us as mothers as well.  At the point a person reaches 18 years of age and is entitled to the birth certificate which will give them information on their original name then we should be entitled to our child's adoption certificate which will give us their new name.  When you think of it, for all those years we think of our children by the name we gave them.  It is very hard, when we find out the new name, to get used to that.  The earlier we can find out the new name the easier it will be for us to get used it.  It is also an emotional thing.  It is a preparation.  It is a preparation for the fact we will be meeting someone who has grown up into adulthood under other people's influence and it will help us with accepting that fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhoda McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I will quickly add to that if the Chair does not mind.

Our journey, good, bad or indifferent was supposed to be ours and ours alone, including his daddy.  DNA testing was not out back then.  Most fathers would never have been allowed on the birth certificate because the clergy registered your child.  On my son's birth certificate it says the residence is 384, Navan Road.  There is not a whisper of St. Patrick's, not a whisper of the nun who signed it Elizabeth, not Sister Elizabeth.  All of these institutions all around Ireland and all these same agencies, not one of them adhered to the Adoption Act 1952, which I only found out about eight years ago.  My son was 40 years of age when I found out the legal rights I had to keeping my son, even in 1973.  Therefore it must be exposed and must be acknowledged.  It must be allowed to be open and transparent and communicated to all.  Our children may suffer as adults, as fathers, as grandfathers or grandmothers.

I will leave this meeting impacted by that.  When this Bill was presented and as we have gone through it, we have seen it and hoped to report on it as being the right of adults and children to know who they are and to be able to trace who they are.  To be honest, I was very pleased with where we were going with that, but today abruptly stops me in my tracks with the thought that we have missed a big step here.  Let me try to reflect what I have heard.  The step is, first and foremost, that there is basic information that the witnesses, as mothers, have a right to know about the care of their children.  That is perhaps the least of the justified demands that I am hearing the witnesses share.<\/p> <p>  The second is the consent given.  I am a privacy lawyer by trade and consent must be fully informed and freely given for it to be truthful.  If girls did not understand the form they were filling out and could mistake an adoption form for a boarding out form, it is not consent.  If the opportunity is absolutely not even offered, then there is no consent.  That context of deliberate misleading and deliberate misinformation has to be borne in mind when we consider the right to information and who has that right to information.<\/p> <p>  I heard the witnesses articulate very movingly that they remember birthdays and Christmas and that they wonder about major events.  I can only imagine what that must be like and how difficult and challenging it is.  I am also hearing an anxiety about the files.  Clearly, there is access to the files to some degree, given that the witnesses can know the difference between them.  I am assuming that is the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  On what basis are the witnesses seeing the files?  I know also from the GDPR that they have a right to amend and correct where there is wrongful content in the files.  Perhaps an information piece has to happen about people's entitlement to that.  What I am hearing is that the files are not accurate.  There is a concern that the notes in them are jaundiced because they were written by people with an agenda and a context.  Perhaps they were nearly reckless as to the content.  It may have been human error for a small minority, or perhaps deliberate misleading and cover-up statements.  The witnesses have a right to know about their babies, what happened to their babies and the content of the file.  There is also an anxiety that when the grown-up baby gets that information, the information accurately portrays the mother and that the mother has a right to put a context on that.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by the words that the witnesses have a right to paint their personalities.  That is very powerful.  They are anxious to communicate who they are to the child.  The information leaflet needs to be more comprehensive.  I am very taken by having somebody sit with the witness to go through the file and to provide her with assistance and context.  Perhaps the accumulation of knowledge from that person after seeing lots of different files would mean the person could say, \"That is what that means\", so the witnesses would get the benefit of that advice.  I hear that very strongly.<\/p> <p>  I have been contacted anonymously and there are mothers who do not want contact because of their current circumstances.  It is not because of the child, but they want to keep it secret due to their current circumstances.  It may be difficult for them to come forward and seek the file to make sure about the file.  Do we need an information campaign to say these files are here and a sensitivity from the State that there may be gross inaccuracies here?<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to reflect their thoughts back.  Is that it?  That is what I think I am hearing the witnesses say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#G00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Senator, exactly who are your questions directed to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#G00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>They are not to anybody.

As we said in our opening statement, this Bill has been constructed as if we never want or need information or contact with our children, and that is so wrong.  We have been fighting for this for many decades.  I will make a plea.  We made a submission as well, not just an opening statement.  The submission the committee has, which I hope the members have read, is very detailed.  We have presented it twice before, unamended and with exactly the same words.  We have been saying the same thing to the same civil servants for decades, and none of that has ever made its way into any legislation.  We do not know the reason for that.  We do not know why there seems to be some type of constructed wall against us as mothers and fathers.  We have a father on our committee as well whose child was adopted.  He is happily reunited with her.  We do not understand why we have not been listened to.  We hope this is a new generation of Deputies and Senators who will have open minds about this, but so far it is like we have been written out of history.<\/p> <p>  In the opening to our submission, we provided a series of quotations which I accessed in the National Archives.  It provides a walk through history and the changing attitudes towards adoption over the years.  Members will see that there is even a quote from a previous Minister for Justice, the late Mr. Paddy Cooney, who championed adoption as being better for the illegitimate baby than to be cared for by the baby's mother.  That was a Minister for Justice addressing the adoption social workers conference.  One can see the type of mindset we were working against and possibly the reason that people want to keep us silenced and want to keep the files closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhoda MacManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I would love to see that unmarried mothers are called \"mothers\", and that they are given some dignity for the first time in the history of Ireland.

I would love to not die before my son knows it is okay for him to come forward and that he does not have to be afraid to do so and hear anything I have to say to him or about what I have left him in my will.  My eldest daughter has made sure she will find him and give him every single thing I have put aside for him so he will know his gene pool and about the love I had for him for the nine months he lived beside my heart and in the precious moment I came face to face with him.

I am here as a natural mother and part of a group called Solace for Mothers.  I am also a member of the Collaborative Forum and the steering group project on language and terminology representing mothers along with other members of the Collaborative Forum.  While we fully support the right of adopted adults to know their origins and identity, which we believe is their human right, we have concerns about the proposed adoption information Bill 2021 in its current draft.<\/p><p>The language with regard to mothers must be changed as we find the term \"birth mother\" offensive as it reduces mothers to the role of incubators.  We also object to other terms such as \"given up\".  We were forced to give up our children for adoption.<\/p><p> I will turn to birth parents&rsquo; privacy rights.  We are particularly concerned with regard to any medical information on our files which may be given to adopted people and their relatives.  Every citizen's medical files are covered by the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am also concerned by our medical files being treated as historical medical information and not our current medical information.  Is there a difference?  It appears that our historical medical information held by State agencies, for example, Tusla, should be handed over to our adopted children but not our current medical files, which are regarded as private.  We are also concerned about the Bill's contention that it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest that the applicant be provided with this information.  Our medical information should be given out only with our consent, which many of us have already given. <\/p><p> Head 13 concerns requests for information from agencies and authorities.  Our concern in this regard is about relatives of natural parents and adoptive relatives.  In some cases, mothers have not informed their families of the existence of their adopted child.  Can relatives of natural parents and adoptive relatives be contacted by State agencies having secured their names, addresses, etc., from other agencies without the natural parents&rsquo; consent? <\/p><p> Page 34 of the Bill, at Part 5, refers to a contact preference register and states that a significant minority of birth mothers gave up more than one child for adoption and may have different preferences as regards each child.  This statement is deeply offensive and derogatory to us as natural mothers in terms of the language used.  It is judgmental and its relevancy is questionable at best.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for listening to our concerns and I and my colleague, Ms McDermott, will try to answer any questions as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice McEvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to express our group's views of the proposed Bill.  We are representatives of a group, called relevant persons in the proposed Bill, and share one thing: each of our birth certificates contains false information making them illegal, not just incorrect.  We are not, as claimed by some groups, illegal adoptees but the victims of kidnap, child trafficking and identity theft.  We fall into three distinct but related groups.  The first group, Tusla file discoveries, currently stands at a membership of 151, with an assortment of records being held by Tusla.  We classify the second group as other or DNA discoveries.  This group currently accounts for 10% of our total with no paperwork to be found but incontrovertible proof of identity through DNA.  The third group comprises descendants of groups 1 and 2.  This is the largest group as it covers the descendants of both preceding groups.  The impact of this group will continue ad infinitum until this Bill is enacted and implemented.<\/p> <p>  False registrations are still occurring now.  The State&rsquo;s inability to provide a solution is now causing each of us to continually break the law while knowingly using false identities.  The number of acknowledged cases of false birth registrations is 151 but that does not take into account groups 2 and 3.  Based on our estimates, that number is actually 1,544 false birth records known to date.  If the suspected cases identified in the Shadow Cast Long report are used, this equates to a potential 178,000 false birth records.  If the marriage and death records are then added, close to 500,000 false records are being held at the General Register Office, GRO.  The Bill only deals with false birth registrations, when, in fact, the GRO must also hold false marriage and death certificates.<\/p> <p>  The State has maintained that the GRO records must be corrected.  Alterations without the immediate issue of a certificate of identity, coupled with a cut-off date for births at 31 December 1970, creates the potential for even more family trauma with potential multiple identities in use.  In an ideal world, all the records would be held by one easily accessible organisation but until that is possible, a detailed service level agreement must be put in place with any organisations involved to include key performance indicators to be regularly monitored by the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and Justice.<\/p> <p>  The use of DNA is critical in both verifying the information held in files and vital in proving identity.  Most of the record files held by the State are either incomplete, or partially or totally false, and some cannot be found.  In addition to making counselling available, the State needs to provide access to qualified genealogists to work with us to enable us to find our true identities.  Without DNA, the Act is of no use to us.  These amendments must be made now.<\/p> <p>  There is nothing in the current Bill to allow the members of this group to access their family data, even when their ancestors are deceased, nor to rectify those false entries.  This is leading to a continuation of false certification as the false information is carried forward by each new generation.  Despite declaring at the start of the Bill that we would be all included, the addition of clause C in head 29, entitled \"Interpretation\", the State is excluding a very large cohort from their right to rectify their false records.  If this is not changed, the State is merely continuing the conspiracy of silence that has brought the Government's predecessors into such disrepute.  Shame on the Government.<\/p> <p>  Justice has been excluded from this Bill while putting a heavy burden on the Irish taxpayer to provide resources.  Why not seize the assets of the organisations that committed the crimes and use that to properly resource and fully implement the Bill?  I am sure the Irish taxpayers would approve.

That would have been an official adoption.  My mum is my mum and she is who she is.  She does not know who she is but she is who she is.  She is not adopted.

We all have seen the advertisements on television, social media and radio for the likes of Ancestry and My Heritage.  People are buying family members DNA tests as Christmas presents, birthday presents and Mother's Day presents.  You innocently spit into a tube, you think you will find your whole family tree and then you suddenly discover there is not a single person on the family tree that you have ever heard of, let alone know.  It is imperative, as far as we are concerned, that there is some kind of database and that DNA is acknowledged to be proof of who you are.  We can use it in the criminal law system.  We can use it when mother and fathers are arguing over who the parent of the child is.  We can use it for all those, but why cannot we use it to know who we are?  From that point of view, DNA has to be involved in this Bill.  There is no way around it.  There is no other answer.<br\/><br\/>It has to be acknowledged that DNA services are not affordable for many people.  My understanding is that they costs approximately &euro;500 per test.  In order to test your DNA against somebody else's, you need at least two people.  That is not on.  It has to be a part of the final Bill.  We would beg for that one to be part of it.<br\/><br\/>The second question the Senator asked was about the 441 versus the 151.  We were shocked when, at the committee's meeting last month, the Minister described the illegal birth registrants as a very small group of 441.  We have been informed that it has always been 151.  It seems that there has been a giant leap in the month of September, but nobody alerted us to that fact.  Regardless of whether it was an error or a typo in the Minister's speech to the committee, it is a huge leap.  We would like to know where that number is coming from.  When we look at our numbers between all three different groups, we are looking at close to 180,000.  When you add all the others group together that are being considered for different parts of this Bill, such as the survivors of the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes, the number of those who actually have adoption orders does not even add up to 178,000.  We are a huge group.  We are not insignificant.  We have to be listened to.<br\/><br\/>I really hope we are heard.  There is a line at the end of the book <i>Banished Babies<\/i>which reads, &quot;Deny until they die.&quot;  There are many who are getting on in life.  Many of the mothers in our group - I use the word &quot;mothers&quot; quite easily, actually - such as my grandmother have passed, unfortunately.  We are running out of time and we need to give these women some kind of justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Kiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Does Ms McEvoy want to come in on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021101900002#L00400","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I want to clarify something there with the language.

Unfortunately, I was informed that the files for my era in Bessborough were probably burnt and that there were no files.

He asked, \"Am I stateless?\"  Could someone expand on that a bit?  He was born in this jurisdiction.  He has an incorrect date of birth.  As happened to many people in the 1960s, he has an inappropriate adoption.  The criterion in the late 1960s was that if a person was of good standing in his or her community, he or she could go to Bessborough and say, \"I want one\".  He or she went down along the row of cots and said, \"I will have that one\" like one would pick apples in the supermarket.

We have provided a detailed submission so I will confine my remarks to just a few key points from that submission.<\/p> <p>  We see this review of the leaving certificate process as both necessary and timely.  We have acknowledged the many positive attributes of the leaving certificate in our submission but we believe that reform is necessary.  That reform must support the maintenance of internationally recognised standards of assessment.  It is critically important that the reform be student-centric.  The leaving certificate should be fair and equitable, recognising the differences in learning style and capacity of students.  It must also address the accepted challenges for students in terms of stress and mental well-being and optimise the pathways to careers or further study for students of all abilities.  The current overbearing prominence of the final examination militates against students with learning disabilities or with a learning intelligence not best suited to a written exam.  The heavy weighting of the final exam is still far too great. The universities advocate strongly for more authentic assessment across all subjects that genuinely reflects the learning and thinking of the student.  We propose that this change be done on a phased basis, ideally over the coming three-year period. <\/p> <p>  The benefits of using a national, State-certified school leaving examination as the basis for selection to higher education are obvious.  It is available to all students under the same conditions with results quality-assured by the State.  It also ensures continuity and comparability year-on-year so that higher education applicants presenting results from different years are treated equitably.<\/p><p> The Central Applications Office, CAO, points system provides an objective and transparent allocation of places, by order of merit, based on leaving certificate achievement.  The points system has been designed on the basis of stable grades but the Covid-induced changes over the past two years has destabilised the results trend.  In 2019, 207 students achieved a maximum score of six H1 grades but two years later, in 2021, this had grown to 1,342 students.  That is an increase of more than 600% in just 24 months.  This has distorted the entry threshold to third level, and I have given just one example from the data, with a particular inequity to applicants presenting results from earlier years.<\/p><p> The IUA proposes that the system immediately reverts to an agreed and stable grade distribution model.  That would ensure that the leaving certificate results can continue to serve as the mainstream selection mechanism for entry into third level. <\/p><p> The timing of leaving certificate results is a particular problem even in normal years.  Results in mid-August means that first college offers cannot be made until the third week of August at the earliest.  Second and third round offers come well into September often after college courses have started.  The college offers for students who appeal their results can arrive a number of weeks into the college year.  This all needs to changes for two key reasons.  First, it gives students and their families an unacceptably short timeframe to find student accommodation and make other practical arrangements.  Second, it is out of line with most other European countries, including the UK, where college offers are made in July or even earlier in some cases.  Let us say an Irish student has applied for a course in an Irish university and a university in Manchester may feel compelled to accept the UK course for fear of not getting a place in Ireland.<\/p><p> The IUA is firmly of the view that these timelines are no longer fit for purpose.  We propose that students should be in possession of their results no later than the end of June of any given year.  This would allow the CAO to process results, and for offers and acceptances to higher and further education to be completed by the end of July.  This would allow students to make rational choices regarding their preferred study options or career options and enable them, and their families, a reasonable period to make the necessary practical arrangements, especially those regarding accommodation but also fees and grants.  This process would also allow for the leaving certificate appeals process to be completed well before the start of the academic year.<\/p><p> The delivery of results within this revised timeline is entirely feasible with less emphasis on the final examination, and a greater use of a range of continuous assessment options.  The IUA proposes that immediate steps are taken to introduce this revised timeline in 2022.<\/p><p>  In summary, the IUA proposals are centred on four key issues: a more equitable leaving certificate, allowing all students to reach their full potential; a greater range of more authentic assessment in the leaving certificate; more stable results to maintain equivalences across years; and, importantly, earlier results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity.<\/p> <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, instigated a phased and considered review of the senior cycle in 2016.  It is evident that the impact of Covid has stimulated acceleration in this discussion.<\/p> <p>  Let us first acknowledge the key role of upper secondary education and the separate fact that it commands domestic and international respect.  We might also be mindful of the strong social and intergenerational connection among individuals educated in Ireland.  The external view from the OECD is: \"Senior cycle enjoys high levels of trust in the public, and its final assessment (the Leaving Certificate) is strongly rooted in the national culture.\"<\/p> <p>  The enforced creation of calculated grades and accredited grades processes in 2020 and 2021 lends additional importance to this topic.  The impact of the pandemic on student engagement and assessment prompted a level of mitigation that has resulted in consequent problems for selection in at least some higher education programmes.  It effectively compromised the greater granularity that resulted from the 2017 review of the grading system.<\/p> <p>  The initial question might usefully be around what the review is trying to achieve.  Any critique of the leaving certificate tends to converge on key elements: the sense that the senior cycle has too narrow a focus and that curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment could be calibrated better to prepare candidates for a fast-changing world; the pressure imposed by the final concentrated summative assessment; the shifting purpose from what was a final award with significant currency to what is now essentially a portal to further or higher education; and, finally, consideration of fostering lifelong learning and facilitating a better continuity of approach to ease transition and assimilation.<\/p><p>Taking these in turn, the relevancy and currency of the curriculum can be anticipated to be focal points in the advisory report.  THEA has encouraged a broadening of the scope of the curriculum to recognise differing intelligence and to encompass more active and problem-based learning.  If we are to shift cultural perceptions and to value all learning equally, and if we wish to realise a moment when students will contemplate pursuing an apprenticeship just as readily as an academic programme, then we need to broaden an inclusive curriculum to reflect better the diversity of what a modern society requires.<\/p><p> There have been calls to do away with assessment altogether.  We should learn from recent examples of mitigations that have tended, unwittingly, to relocate a problem.  In the absence of a graded and respected leaving certificate, it is likely that many students and parents will look to replace it with something such as the international baccalaureate.  Any such decision would have consequences for Ireland&rsquo;s educational reputation, which the OECD attests.<\/p><p> It is important to recognise that assessment drives learning.  Authentic and timely assessment is for learning.  Properly calibrated, it helps to develop students' ability to evaluate themselves and make judgments to enhance their own performance.  Ireland is somewhat of an outlier in our secondary education's historic reliance on summative assessment for certification purposes.  This expresses itself mostly in written tasks, which favour a particular type of intelligence.  It is conservative and innately iniquitous.  The lessons from Covid, the embrace of a digital world, and the technical facility of younger generations all propose that we should explore a far greater component of formative assessment.  This will require stakeholder buy-in but the benefits for learning and student welfare are indisputable.<\/p><p> The leaving certificate was once a passport to many jobs.  This has changed and most employers seek evidence of a post-secondary qualification.  Thus, the purpose has altered.  This has impacted the scope of the examination.  Greater choice and a larger component of self-directed learning would be more consistent with the ambitions for lifelong learning.  It makes practical sense to utilise the leaving certificate as a contributing determinant in selection for higher education.  Replacing it or supplementing it with a separate matriculation process would simply transfer pressure as well as adding a significant administrative burden.  The CAO system is elective and it has the quality of being dispassionate.  It is publicly valued for its link to State-managed appraisal.  THEA supports the retention of the system but with an altered assessment approach and an earlier indication point that takes the pressure off the learner, the State Examinations Commission, SEC, the CAO and the receiving colleges.  This presupposes a greater proportion of formative assessment and a more modular approach.<\/p><p> We must also guard against the tail wagging the dog.  The simple truth is that higher education is open to all with ambition and reasonable application.  The headlines and the pressures centre on a delimited number of high-demand programmes with finite places.  In seeking to reform the system, we might usefully separate out this smaller cohort of programmes for particular attention.<\/p><p> Concerning continuity of the pedagogical approach, learning and assessment in second level is different from that to be expected in higher education.  There would be appreciable merit in aligning approaches so that not just the final examination but the substance and the mode of the senior cycle better prepare our citizens for lifelong learning whenever and wherever they might choose to pursue it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity given to HECA to present to the committee.  HECA is the representative body for private Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, validated higher education institutions.  In our view, the leaving certificate should be a capstone assessment of students' entire second level learning experience.  Instead, it is used to allocate third-level places.  One may ask what is at stake in this regard; it is &euro;336,800.  This is the value on the international marketplace of six years of medical education given to students who attain the highest number of points.  This is compared to &euro;3,000 for another student.  I want people to dwell for a moment on this disparity.  We see the disparity between the world market value of &euro;336,000 for a medical education and &euro;3,000 for recipients of some courses.  We must bear in mind the &euro;336,000 is allocated on the toss of a roulette wheel called random selection.  I suggest this is another obscenity.<\/p> <p>  In response, students game the system, as acknowledged by a former Minister for education.  They focus on subjects leading to maximum points as opposed to personal development.  The assessment requires absolute precision in marking for fairness in the hugely diverging resource allocations.  Every mark has to be justified.  This makes the examination more predictable and easier to game.<\/p><p> Equity demands fundamental change.  I have asked myself how we can liberate the leaving certificate from this burden, this heavy responsibility, of being the deciding factor in the allocation of those hugely diverging resources.  One politically difficult approach would be to have unrestricted entry to third level, which would release that burden from the leaving certificate, and places would be granted on the basis of first-year performance within the higher education institutions, as is the case in France.  Another politically difficult approach would be to provide additional places to meet demand and funding them, if necessary, from student loans.<\/p><p> Two less difficult alternatives would be to create alternative pathways for disappointed students and to introduce alternative access credits, which I will discuss.  Assessment options should reflect the student voice and their range of abilities; stagger assessment throughout the senior cycle, providing performance measures that support different learning styles; increase the focus on formative learning, creative assessment, experiential learning and progression paths; address an inclusive curriculum embracing specialisations, apprenticeships, voluntary work and life skills; and replace the predict-and-memorise emphasis and 100% summative assessment with group work, presentations, multimedia project work such as podcasts, video and reflective writing or blogging, and portfolios reflecting an assessment of practical soft skills, for instance, communication, teamwork, analytical reasoning and critical thinking, which are not currently assessed.  They should also give credits for community activities, sporting and personal achievements and micro-credential type credits.<\/p><p> Digital technology and digital learning environments, as well as learning technology professionals employed in schools, would improve teaching and assessment, digital literacy, core e-safety skills and online safety and ethics, and promote more novel ways of interaction.  Curriculum expansion should cover emerging technologies and more flexible delivery options.  Key subjects would include the proper referencing of sources and the avoidance of plagiarism.  Referencing should become the \"fourth R\", along with reading, writing and arithmetic.  Laptops should be provided and Internet connectivity improved to close the digital divide.<\/p><p> On access, equality and well-being supports, improved consideration is needed of the challenges to learners with disabilities and disadvantage and in large class sizes.  A dedicated task force should be created to identify initiatives to increase further education participation rates in Dublin 1, 2, 13 and 17 and other unrepresented districts nationwide.  As I said to this committee on the previous occasion I presented to it, the participation rate in Dublin 6 is 99%, whereas that in Dublin 13 is 17%.  That difference is obscene.<\/p><p> On higher and further education requirements in respect of vocational options and career paths, the CAO and one-to-one career guidance should present all options, including apprenticeships and further and higher education, and focus on future potential career roles with support from regional skills forums, SOLAS, Intreo and the expert group on future skills needs.  Transition between programmes should be facilitated by flexibility.  Alumni support groups could advise on post-school experience.  I feel strongly about the current cap of 450 points applying to further education students for transfer to higher education.  If a student coming from a further education college applies to the CAO, his or her points will be limited to 450, no matter how well he or she has performed.  Often, students coming from further education colleges perform very well at third level.<\/p><p> On the Irish language and education, the language should be promoted as a living language, focusing on oral language and Irish in daily life, with continuous assessment.  We should provide a national measurement scale as in English, such as TOEFL or IELTS, and require a certain proficiency.<\/p><p> On international best practice, students need the skills to be successful, global and national citizens and to be agile to change.  New curriculums should focus not only on knowledge but also on the skills, values, attitudes and interpersonal awareness that are required in the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The ETBI welcomes the invitation by the joint committee to its examination of leaving certificate reform, including recommendations involving Youthreach provision.  Our submission draws on the knowledge of the education and training boards, ETBs, where about 3,700 places are provided annually in more than 100 Youthreach centres throughout the network.<\/p><p>About one third of all Youthreach learners successfully pursue the leaving certificate applied programme every year.  This model meets the needs of a cohort of learners for whom the traditional format of school did not meet their needs.  The leaving certificate applied model supports our Youthreach learners to continue their education and further their life opportunities.  We advocate a senior cycle model comparable to the leaving certificate applied model which embraces vocational subject specifications that lead to competence in vocational skills for learners.<\/p><p> Managers and practitioners within Youthreach settings agree that the leaving certificate applied model provides the opportunity to support the non-linear nature of progression experienced by many Youthreach learners.  It is incumbent on us to prepare our Youthreach learners with transversal and technology skills to support their future career choices.  In regard to provision, the proposed reform of the leaving certificate must ensure that the learners&rsquo; capabilities are realised through the different strands and choices in senior cycle education; subject specifications should prepare learners for lifelong learning, in addition to academic attainment; and delivery approaches should embrace interactive, experiential, and practical modes of teaching and learning.  Alternative means of assessment, such as skills demonstration, and assessment performance that provide for incremental and continuous assessment over the two years of the programme are recommended.<\/p><p> Measures of reform should include the integration of higher order skills, reflective thinking and interpersonal skills, as well as technological and digital literacy supports.  We note the need for literacy and numeracy supports concurrent with the leaving certificate programme to widen participation and overcome learning barriers.  There should be an integration of models, such as universal design for learning, UDL, into the curriculum with increased levels of inclusion.  Leaving certificate reform should aim to challenge social inequality by actively enabling the progression options best suited to the learners&rsquo; aspirations and interests, including paths to apprenticeships, further education and training, FET, higher education and traineeships.<\/p><p> I again mention that the literacy and numeracy deficits remain major concerns.  Improved post-primary level supports in these areas are an essential part of reform.  Learner support should also meet the needs of groups experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, ethnic minorities and learners with a disability, and should focus on eliminating economic inequality, which might include the costs associated with transport and materials.<\/p><p> Broader awareness of the wide range of options available to learners has become even more important with the ongoing restructuring of the CAO portal.  Learners will now have a range of further education and training, including post-leaving certificate and apprenticeships options, available to them and it is vital that all learners are aware of these options.

We would point out that assessment by teachers or in our case lecturers is a standard format in the third level system and is done to the very highest international standards with independent validation.  There are mechanisms through which it can be done and done effectively.  We would await the NCCA report and moves in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Deputy's third question, the question of retaining confidence in the system while changes are made is fundamental.  We have made comments about reform but we do so in the context that the leaving certificate is a State-certified exam and has an intrinsic value notwithstanding the challenges we see with it.  It is important to retain the leaving certificate as a State-certified process to offer to students, regardless of whether they are moving directly on to a career or taking different pathways.  It is important that the reform process happens and that we maintain confidence over the next number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Farrell for his questions.  One of the points I made was around the work done by the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education.  There is a disparity between the experience that students meet at second level and third level, and much could be done around that.  That includes assessment.  The first two enhancement themes for the national forum were transitions and assessment.  There is very good work and learning done on that.  I agree with Mr. Miley that when the advisory report comes out, a greater volume of continuous assessment would be likely in that context.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the question of educational disadvantage, one of the lessons we have seen from the Covid-19 experience is that a small amount of targeted support can make an enormous difference.  We are not talking about volumes of money, but certainly broadband, counselling and availability of laptops became huge issues.  There were stories of students driving to carparks to take up the Wi-Fi  of the college.<\/p> <p>  On the question of confidence, what we are seeing are blip years with the leaving certificate.  There is a matter of recalibrating.  Certainly the work that was done on the regrading in 2017 deliberately brought in greater granularity to avoid precisely this type of thing.  We will end up with cross-generational disparity but we can resume.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Regarding assessment by teachers, our problem there is subjectivity.  The problem really is that one teacher may assess his or her own student differently from another teacher.  That process is actually desirable.  It is a process that happens in third level all the time.  Essentially the solution is not to focus on the problem but to liberate the leaving certificate from the consequences of that assessment.  Why do we have to be objective?  Why must we have a precise base of allocation?  It is because of what is at stake.  There is too much at stake.<\/p><p>How do we deal with that?  Dr. Ryan suggested we segregate the high-end programmes and have a different allocation mechanism for them.<\/p><p> We should also be looking at more creative options, and more of them, for people so that if a student loses out as a result of a subjective assessment by one teacher that favours another student and a negative assessment from another teacher, there are other options for that student.  If we are seriously to take on board the points that have been made about experiential assessment, portfolios, project work and all of those things, we are going to be dealing with subjective assessment.  That is going to be a reality.  The important thing is to release the leaving certificate from the consequences of that.<\/p><p> The key point in a disadvantaged student's life is probably early stage education, both first and second level education.  We need to look at the expenditure on that and assess its effectiveness.  We need targets.  I would like to see, for instance, a target of entry to third level for a certain number of students and I would like the expenditure to be measured against that.  That sounds like a commercial perspective but there are limited resources and it is our responsibility to get the maximum benefit from those resources.  The resources should be judged by their effectiveness.  That is what I would say for disadvantaged students.<\/p><p> The problems created by Covid-19 are probably precursors of the kinds of problems we are going to face as we move to more subjective assessment.  We can, through proper training and comparisons of results, bring more objectivity into individual teacher assessment.  We are going to be dealing with those issues anyway.  The challenge is getting it right and making sure those who are disappointed as a result have alternatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Hegarty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#K00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>May I come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#K00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>You may, very briefly.

I found them particularly exciting, if I can use that word, because I feel there is an historic opportunity for us to grasp reform of the leaving certificate and do something with it.  I do not think anybody who has been through it or who has a family member going through it or who is in the system can pretend it should stay as it is.  Even the term \"leaving certificate\" is a complete misnomer because I do not think anybody genuinely expects that the majority of students will use it as an entry into the workforce.  It does not provide an entry into the workforce.  It is an entrance examination for the next academic phase for most students.<\/p><p>We have a particularly unequal education system, which is especially pronounced at second level.  Second-level schools compete against each other.  Social mobility means there is a push to get into what is perceived to be, in any given community, a more academic school, which can sometimes be fee-paying and sometimes not.  As a result, there is a stepping-stone effect with the most desirable or second-most desirable schools and, at the end of that entire ladder, there is always a school in any given community that has a disproportionate number of migrant and Traveller children in addition to children with special educational needs.  We allow those schools to exist because we want to allow social mobility, and choice and competition between second-level schools, to continue.  It is the patronage model and we are stuck with it unless we decide to have a referendum on it.  <\/p><p> The point is it is already very unequal.  As has been said, people can game the system to try to buy results by getting grinds.  Certain second-level schools cannot even offer higher-level subjects because they cannot justify the resources.  Those subjects include higher-level maths and Irish so how can someone be a primary school teacher if he or she goes to that school?  He or she cannot.  It is already particularly unequal.  Some 85% of students who attend disadvantaged second-level schools do the leaving certificate.  The average percentage of students, overall, who do it, is approximately 91% so 15% of disadvantaged students do not make it to the leaving certificate at all.  <\/p><p> We also have the issue of piled-on pressure at the end of sixth year, which does not indicate anybody's ability in anything.  It might make someone good at training to be a politician, where he or she does all his or her work at the end of five years and pretends he or she has been working very hard all the way through.  Most of us do.  Anyway, it is all piled in at the end to prove your worth.  It is not surprising many young people do not make it through.  It is also not surprising that the lesson they have learned and the training they have received in the second-level system does not in any way equip them for the future.  <\/p><p> My main focus is on getting the witnesses' reflections on what I have said about the inequalities within the system.  Does the system in any way equip young people to be the best of themselves, to think independently, to trust their own judgments and opinions and to have the self-confidence to go to the next stage of their lives?  Is it just a hole they have to fill to get to the next point?  I would be interested in comments on that.  It is not directed at anybody in particular.  I am just interested in the witnesses' reflections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#K00800","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy's view that we have a stratified second-level system with deep-seated inequality within it.  It is certainly something we are very conscious of.  The question is what changes we can make to the leaving certificate to try to cater for the varying learning styles, not just abilities.  We all know people who have come through the leaving certificate and are brilliant at particular aspects of life and learning but who cannot do a written examination and fail abysmally as a result.<\/p> <p>  The curricular assessment report will, hopefully, deal with this issue comprehensively but we have done this already in junior cycle.  There has been substantial reform of the junior cycle where the broader skills base and interests of students are catered for.  When speaking to second-level students, as I have, they will say they did fine in primary school and up to junior cycle, but once they hit fifth year they fell off a cliff.  The model of reform of junior cycle gives us something to work with, combined with the assessment piece we spoke about previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and reflections.

This committee has played a huge part in the development of the technological universities.  You can see the impact they will have on the future prosperity and sustainability of regions and how they will fit in with national development plan.  That type of practical learning is not central to our second level curriculum.  It will require self-directed learning and taking the high-stakes element out of the leaving certificate.  Going back to Deputy Farrell's point, the high stakes involved is a consequence of a small number of programmes and is not the reality, yet that culture has informed thinking on this.<\/p><p> I will be brief because I know others want to contribute.  We are trying to build a research base in this country and we should look to do more about this in second level education.  I know the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will focus on direction of exploration, which was not there during my time in secondary school.  I know much has been done in that regard but it should be about increasing that.  It encultures people before they enter third level education.

Mr. Miley rightly talked about students falling off the cliff when moving from transition year to fifth year.  It is because the assessment completely changes.  The focus of the assessment in the leaving certificate is utterly different.  I completely agree with the Deputy about education preparing students for life.  It is about much more than an academic education.  It prepares them for life, not just for work.  All those skills developed in transition year need to be better assessed in the leaving certificate so that people do not fall off the cliff.  It should be a continuation.

Professor Hegarty referred to the reform of the junior certificate.  From my memory, that was not an easy process to go through at the time, although it was not suggested that people go into the workforce with only a junior certificate.  The timing and way in which that programme was reformed meant it was a difficult process.  That experience probably put the political system off reforming the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  That said, I appeal to the people involved in this process to ask themselves what the point of this is.  If we were to put the student at the heart of this process, we would construct an entirely different system, but we always seem to have every other agency or interest group pulling and dragging at the system.  If middle Ireland likes something because it has been through it and it has been successful for it, then middle Ireland will want to defend it.  However, we are not here for middle Ireland; we are here for every young person in the system.<\/p><p>I do not think any young person going through it, regardless of their background, feels that it reflects them.

I found the presentations and briefing notes very interesting because we are starting to move to the crux of the matter, which is how we try to balance tensions between having an external, fair exam and how we can match it up with a continuous assessment model.  We all agree the leaving certificate rewards a specific, narrow set of skills.  We want to move beyond that to reward wider critical thinking skills and different learning styles, in particular.  It is frustrating we are doing this still blind of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, report.

Do we find our leaving certificate students are struggling because they have suddenly moved to a different learning model or are they well equipped?  I suspect it is probably the former.

At one stage, we had people coming in from second level who were very able students, but we had to put in remedial work at the start of first year just to get them into that.  It had to do with differing learning styles.  I talked recently to the parent of a very bright child in third level who said he or she was finding it very difficult.

Obviously, numeracy is extremely important, but students who struggle with it can at least make the choice to limit it to one subject.

We discovered during the Covid period that by being able to extend digital skills to smaller centres, particularly Youthreach centres, which often have weaker learners and much smaller numbers, it allowed us to keep those learners in the education system and get them to the leaving certificate applied examination.  Without investing in that technology, it would not have happened for them.  During the Covid period, the disparity between those who had access to digital capability, and all the tools that go with it, and those who did not was quite broad.  Students who did not have access were severely disadvantaged.  It is the nature of society that the more disadvantaged one is, the further one is from achieving educationally.  That is one of the reasons we draw attention to this issue.<\/p> <p>  On the point regarding literacy and numeracy, we have found, particularly through the Youthreach model over 30-odd years, that the impact of literacy and numeracy deficits can be devastating for a young person.  It is hard to believe that someone can get to 16 years of age and be barely able to write a letter or comprehend a piece of normal English writing.  We are not even talking about foreign languages.  People do not realise the impact that has on an individual.  This is one of the things the leaving certificate applied examination assesses, and the Youthreach model is very much about increasing those skills.  Without good literacy and numeracy skills, one cannot get into an electrician apprenticeship scheme, for instance, and one will suffer in many other apprenticeship schemes.  With all due respect, nobody wants an electrician with poor literacy or numeracy skills wiring a fuse board.  I fully agree with the Deputy on the importance of this issue.

That is really welcome.  I am a little surprised, in a good way, that after three sessions, there is the vague outline of areas of agreement.  There is not quite a consensus but there has been substantial agreement across many of the organisations from which we have heard.  First, there is clear agreement that the weight of emphasis that is put on a terminal examination is excessive.  That has been expressed by all the groups that have come before the committee.  We need to work towards a system where students have an opportunity to build up credits, however that is structured.<\/p> <p>  Another issue where there is agreement is one we have not discussed much today but in respect of which I am more convinced of the need for action the more we talk about it.  This is the need radically to expand the number of people going into apprenticeships.  I am especially convinced of its importance because no matter what shape of system we envision, and we can certainly make the system much better, if there is more demand than space because there is too much emphasis on higher education, people will find ways of gaming the system.  No matter what system we set up, people will find a way to game it.  Culturally and policy-wise, a huge part of what we need to do is to transform the perception of apprenticeships and how they are integrated into the system.  Mathematics is going to be very important in this regard because many trades, especially the emerging trades, are focused on precision, and that requires mathematics skills.<\/p> <p>  There are other areas on which there is less agreement, one being the question of external versus internal assessment.  I understand the point Professor Hegarty made in this regard.  I approach the matter with an open mind but my gut instinct is that the relationship between student and teacher at second level is different from the relationship at third level.  We need to take account of that.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Professor Hegarty.  I will try to ask all the questions together, hoping that the witnesses will be able to keep track of them.  In some ways, the idea of separating out the leaving certificate examination from the process of access to third level is appealing.  To be fair to the people who designed the examination, it was never really envisioned or planned as such a mechanism.  Industrially, we were in a different world when the leaving certificate was introduced but, since then, it has become a mechanism for accessing third level education.  If we are to separate it out, we need fair and objective criteria for allocating third level places.  One possible problem is the potential for duplication.<\/p> <p>  Second, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made an important point about what middle Ireland likes.  There are things middle Ireland might prefer but there are dangers in that.  I would feel a certain hesitancy in regard to personal statement interviews and other methods that are open to bias on the grounds of class, gender and race.  As I said, I approach all of this with an open mind, but we need to be careful of that.  If we are going to have a separate system for allocating third level places, what should that system be and how do we avoid duplication?  I have a related question for all the witnesses on an issue to which Professor Hegarty referred in his presentation, namely, open access, as in the French system.  Such a system would be very expensive but we owe it to students to consider and discuss all the options.  I am interested in any comments from the witnesses in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Ryan and Mr. Miley.<\/p><p>I am cautious in putting this question because our dealing with the leaving certificate and reform of it need not be focused on this, but we need to take consideration of it.  What are the skills deficits that students coming out of the leaving certificate have?  I emphasise that this is not the focus of why we need to reform the leaving certificate, but we need to be aware of it and we need to take account of it.<\/p><p> My final question is for Mr. Whyte.  In my experience, learners in Youthreach are quite diverse and people will be in Youthreach for a wide variety of reasons.  Without being too prescriptive, if Mr. Whyte was designing a new leaving certificate do we need to continue to have a leaving certificate and the leaving certificate applied?  Would Mr. Whyte prefer if a reformed leaving certificate could cater for the people currently doing the leaving certificate applied just as it is, without a separate streaming programme or is it an integration of the two?  Is it possible to create a leaving certificate that can cater for all learners without a different stream or a different channel?  I am open-minded on those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#P00200","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I will deal with the apprenticeship question as I have a large interest in apprenticeships in Waterford and Wexford, but first I will address the Youthreach question.<\/p> <p>  Today we are focused on the leaving certificate applied but two thirds of Youthreach learners also do QQI modules.  We should not forget that the leaving certificate applied is one route they take to get where they want to get to.<\/p> <p>  In answer to the Deputy's question, yes it would be wonderful, and no it probably will not happen.  The difficulty is, to design a system that would comprehend all learners in a system that allows multiple assessments, practical demonstrations and the whole thing, would perhaps be a gargantuan challenge.  It would be wonderful but it might be just a step too far.  It is a bit like trying to eat an elephant; sometimes it must be done one bite at a time and cannot all be done at one sitting.<\/p> <p>  The leaving certificate applied is particularly useful for the variety for one third of learners because they have not survived in a school setting.  Going back to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point about the four types of school in an area.  There is always a fifth.  There is also a Youthreach centre somewhere that is there to help those learners who do not survive in the other four types of school, and they do a very good job.<\/p> <p>  On the apprenticeship question, I agree with the Deputy.  We have a very significant presence in apprenticeship in Waterford and in Wexford, and we plan to have a bigger one in Wexford in time to come.  I wish to be very clear about apprenticeships.  There is also the role of traineeships, which are a very appropriate model, and sometimes more appropriate for the type of craft that one wants to develop than apprenticeship.  Apprenticeship does not suit all types, to be frank.<\/p> <p>  The second factor with an apprenticeship is that it must be planned.  It is an enormously expensive provision to have.  It normally must be planned for two to two and half years in.  If we want an electrical workshop put in somewhere we need to think one to one and a half years ahead.  While we are certainly trying to go through an emergency response at the moment, that will not kick in until next summer.  If we are predicting greater numbers down the road we need to invest now to have the provision in two and a half or three years' time, and then have continuous investment.  This matter has been looked at.<\/p> <p>  The third part of the question is whether apprenticeship should be within the whole CAO system anyway.  This is being piloted at the moment, and hopefully down the road it will be included.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes guidance counsellors do not pay the same level of attention to apprenticeship because it is not seen as a valid career choice.  Some guidance counsellors see it as something one does if one does not get into university.  I am not saying that they all do, but perhaps some guidance counsellors do not pay apprenticeship the attention that it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Whyte"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I have been following this discussion over the previous sessions, and I would like to pick up a couple of points.  The Deputy spoke about a thoughtful conversation.  I compliment the Chairman and the committee.  I have been very impressed, even this morning.  I was very much taken by the Deputy's comment about the different relationship between the teacher and pupil at second level and third level.  It is a very well-made point.  To some extent at second level, as people advance through, it is a question of letting go and increasingly allowing them to take responsibility.  This goes to the point about what are the skills deficits when people come in.<\/p> <p>  I echo Mr. Whyte's comments on apprenticeship and I fully agree with him.  Our society is a complex organism and it needs lots of different skills.  There is a question, however, about valuing all those skills equally.  This may go to the point of whether we have three different types of leaving certificate or whether it is possible to have all of that in one.  This is why we need the report to have a look at some of this.<\/p><p> On the question of apprenticeship, the Deputy mentioned the point of perception, which is a key part of this.  We had the old apprenticeships and we have the new apprenticeships but we still call them apprenticeships.  In the public mind, people do not necessarily distinguish between these things.  I believe they may have an old-fashioned sense around this.  It may have something to do with the marketing of this.  There is also something about lifelong learning and earn and learn.  We especially need to look at the funding through the national training fund if employers are being taxed up to a certain percentage at this stage.  It seems we have to have more conversation about that perception piece.<\/p><p> On the question of open access, I was talking to a senior member of a university in Europe.  Anyone who wants to do medicine can come into that university.  Of course, it has an enormous failure rate.  This goes to the point made about cost.  Common sense must come into play on this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I completely agree with the points Dr. Ryan made about apprenticeships.  He was far more eloquent in making the point I made earlier that there must be other pathways.  We need more apprenticeships and opportunities.  The Germans have really lived this way.  Their whole education system is built around this and it has been very effective for them.  Ireland can do the same.<\/p> <p>  If we are to embrace apprenticeships, we need to have a policy of fluidity in progression.  I will ask a simple question.  Why can a nurse not transition to become a doctor?  If we ask this question in relation to a whole range of professions, we then start looking at obstacles to progression within apprenticeships.  Apprenticeships should be accepted as a completely equal and respectable route.  They should not be regarded in the way Dr. Ryan described earlier, as traditional apprenticeships.  If apprenticeship is to be regarded as an equal route, there must be equal opportunities for progression.  We must eliminate those obstacles that exist, which reflect the rights of the professional elite.  We have to remove those obstacles and have progression for apprentices.  If we do that, we will have a definite opportunity to create an alternative route that would capitalise on the abilities I spoke about in answer to an earlier question, namely, the abilities to integrate analytical reasoning, to communicate and to work in teams.  These are all abilities people will develop in the workplace.  The apprenticeships will develop those, capitalise on them and make leaders out of those people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I will bring in Mr. Miley now as I want to be fair to other speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#R00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I apologise; I was getting enthusiastic there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Professor Hegarty's comments on the need to radically expand apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  My colleague referred to critical thinking as a skills deficit.  It is one of the key deficits of those who come into the third level system.  The lack of critical thinking, group learning and group work are very much a feature of the experience as they come through from the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether the leaving certificate and entry to third level education should be separated, we have dealt with this in the more detailed submission to the committee.  On balance, we believe that a State-accredited leaving certificate, or whatever it might be called as a result of a reformed process, should remain as the primary mechanism for entry into the third level system.  It may not be perfect, but in an already strained system we could get into significant duplication of resources and costs.  There is that bias issue.  We had the matriculation exam in the past and there are still elements of it in one or two colleges for one or two courses.  That was used at a time when the proportion of people who went through level education was very small.<\/p><p>It would be an enormous challenge to set up that system for 80,000 applicants a year.

I have been listening intently online for part of the meeting and now I am here.  This is one of the most refreshing, honest and valuable conversations we have had around leaving certificate reform and what needs to be done.  Our guests' experiences and their honesty are appreciated and will be valuable for the report we are trying to do and in identifying the priorities we want to come out of that report.  We would not want to see 100 different recommendations and none of them implemented.  We need to focus on some key things.  I take on board in particular what Mr. Miley said about the transition, that it might take three years to do what we need to do on a phased basis while preserving the benefits of the leaving certificate as it is.  It is easy for us to say it is all rubbish and we need to change it without concentrating on the positives.  Quality assurance, continuity, comparability, equability and State certification are all important.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the immediate challenge we face for the 80,000 students who will sit the leaving certificate examination this year.  Dr. Ryan referred to the destabilisation of the results trend and the need to recalibrate.  How do we do that in the immediate term?  How do we get away from the use of the random selection to choose between applicants?  There is an absolute unfairness in that and the sense of injustice for those who have been subject to it is ferocious.  We need to deal with that issue.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the barriers to cross-Border student mobility in higher education and the difference in the value of A levels and the leaving certificate.  What part do our guests think we should play in reforming the leaving certificate and considering how we compare the A levels sat by students in the North to allow them to apply for courses in the different colleges across the island?<\/p> <p>  The Higher Education Colleges Association, HECA, stated the leaving certificate curriculum should be reformed to promote Irish as a living language.  Could Professor Hegarty expand on that further and outline the type of teaching that students require?  Does he believe there may be an issue with teacher fluency?  Would this type of change require much retraining for teachers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#S00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her incisive questions.  She asked how we deal with the immediate challenge.  I quoted some statistics earlier but another contained in our main submission to the committee is that in 2019, 13% of students achieved 500 points or more.  The equivalent this year was 26%, which is double the amount.  There are numerous other data points at which one can look.  When we refer to recalibrating, we mean that we must level the curve.  We cannot have another yo-yo effect next year whereby we dive into a valley again.  Whatever decisions are taken must gently flatten the curve.  Ideally, it should not sit at the level it is at and should come back down.  That needs to be done on a transitionary basis.  It needs to be carefully calibrated and if we do not do that, disadvantage will continue.  Either next year's students or those from last year and the year before will be disadvantaged.  Stability is absolutely critical, even if it is an imperfect system.  We must get the system stable and then make the necessary changes.<\/p><p>The Deputy also mentioned the cross-Border issue.  Our proposals around timing are important in that regard.  Deputy Farrell earlier asked about the relative positions in other countries.  In Sweden, students get the equivalent of the leaving certificate results on 10 June.  In Finland, students get their results at the end of May.  In Denmark, students get their results on 5 July.  The results of the French <i>baccalaur&eacute;at<\/i>are available in the first or second week of July.  The results of the German <i>Abitur<\/i>are available by 15 July.  As the committee is aware, results of the UK exams are available earlier than the results of our exams.  More than that, UK universities make conditional offers to students, sometimes in March or April.  We have a real challenge with attracting Northern Irish students, very few of whom study here.  The timing issue is a considerable factor in that.  A student in Antrim or Derry has a choice available in May or June, certainly by July, of an offer from a UK university.  The student will ask whether to take the place or wait and hope.  Of course that student will take the place.  Some of our member universities made a considerable effort in the years before Covid-19 to recruit more students from Northern Ireland and did not succeed very well.  Timing is one factor in addressing that issue.  There are other issues around A levels but I am probably not best qualified to comment on those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her razor-sharp questions.  I fully agree with the points Mr. Miley has made and will not labour them again.  In reforming the leaving certificate a number of years ago, we tried to get greater granularity so we would avoid problems.  Covid-19 has been the issue here.  The unfairness extends, in particular, to students who are presenting with results from previous years.  It seems to me that if the situation stays stable, there will have to be some mechanism to accommodate and recognise those issues for a period of time.  It will not be perfect, as Mr. Miley said, but it is critical to try to get stability back into the system.<\/p> <p>  The leaving certificate has highly respected standards.  I fully agree with Mr. Miley's point about retaining the leaving certificate as an element in determining places in higher education.  For a few high-demand programmes, an extra piece may be required.  There is an element of the tail wagging the dog to that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the cross-Border piece.  I am conscious of the work the Royal Irish Academy did on higher education futures.  That is an all-island piece and, as the Deputy knows, the north west was a big feature of that.  The fact that there is that all-island context to our shared island means there is a chance to look at that again.  As Mr. Miley rightly said, there is less student traffic than one would have thought between the North and South.  Given the situation at the moment, including the impact of Brexit, etc., there are questions around research and collaboration.  The dynamic has changed somewhat in that regard.  Our registrars have looked at this.  They benchmark and it is possible that it is time to look at the issue again in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>When the Deputy joined the meeting earlier, I noted and admired the assiduous notes she was taking.  I return the compliment she gave us at the beginning.  She asked questions about random selection and the Irish language to which I will reply.  Random selection is a real problem.  We must ask ourselves how many places are available in medicine and what is the limit.  The limit is the number of clinical places.  We must ask how many of those clinical places are actually taken up by non-EU students.  It is a significant number.  The universities must market medical education abroad to balance the books.  The fees are substantial, but perhaps the Government would consider buying some of those places.  That would give more places to Irish students and is one solution to the Deputy's question about random selection.  The problem of the swelling of the numbers in random selection is a function of the pandemic.<\/p><p>We may have that problem again if we have more continuous assessment.  I hope it is a temporary problem.<br\/><br\/>On the question of Irish, I will give the Deputy a very subjective answer to her question.  My French is much better than my Irish.  I can conduct a meeting in French with a French team.  On a project in Vietnam, I found myself in a team of six where the other five were French speakers.  Naturally, the language <i>du travail<\/i>was actually French and that was what you had to live with.  Had the working language for that been Irish, I might have had more difficulty and that is a terrible thing to have to say to fellow Irish citizens.  I believe it was because, in the teaching of Irish I experienced, I really did not develop a love for the language.  I developed an affection for French.  I had a great French teacher.<br\/><br\/>What do we need to solve the problem?  It is too late to solve the problem for me, although maybe not.  You never stop learning.  What do we need to solve the problem in schools?  We need to focus on oral Irish and on continuous assessment.  We need to focus on the richness of the Irish language.

On that last point, I agree with Professor Hegarty there is certainly much more we can all be doing to try to generate a love of our first language in the country.  We all understand incentives as well.  Perhaps if a certain mastery of Irish were a requirement for progress within academic administration, and indeed if we were to go back to a rule around a certain mastery of Irish being necessary for advancement within the Civil Service, that might help as well.  I do not think we should put it all down to the failure of the education system to engender a love of Irish, because it did not fail in every situation.<\/p> <p>  Returning to today's core business of leaving certificate reform, I wish to begin by suggesting a couple of principles I think we all agree on.  One is that the individual learner and his or her needs should be placed at the centre of any redesign of the senior cycle.  The second principle is the leaving certificate must be a fair measure of student accomplishment and achievement on all aspects of his or her learning during his or her years in senior cycle.  If there is a third principle, it might be we must take the needs of industry and our country into account.  If there is a fourth, it might be that the needs of academic administration and colleges, that is, their commercial and administrative needs, while important, must come in at that point in the pecking order of concern because we must serve the higher principles.<\/p> <p>  It is with that in mind I propose the first point.  Surely if we are talking about a student-centred experience, we should be interviewing all candidates for college rather than treating them as mere CAO numbers?  It happens to a degree with art and teacher training.

If we go back 30 or 40 years to when we had the matriculation, which probably was a precursor version of what the Senator is talking about, albeit through an exam, although there were also some interview processes back in the day, you were talking about some figure in the low thousands for entrants to third level.  If you had a well-resourced third level system, that is something that could be considered, but as we have spoken about at this committee before, we have a very under-resourced third level system as it stands.

Interestingly, as the Senator developed his proposal, it became clear, to my mind, that he was talking about interviewing not as a selection mechanism but more as a career guidance process.  It is the idea that people would actually spend the first semester at university getting their minds clear.  I am aware of many students who have started a programme and then discovered, perhaps after a year, that it does not suit them, and suddenly they have lost a year of funding.  There is, therefore, a lot of merit in the Senator's proposal that people should have three months general education during which they can get their minds clear.  That transition into third level is a new experience and many students realise in their first year that it is not for them.  I think the Senator has got something there.

In many cases, students from disadvantaged backgrounds depend on school to teach such skills.  However, the leaving certificate examination, as structured, does not measure that kind of activity or area of endeavour.

We have given a lot of thought to the first semester.  It is about orientation and induction.

A number of us have been asking for some years what the point of that is because there is something about that link back.

I came down to the meeting prepared to ask certain questions A, B and C but I will change tack and ask a different question on the basis of what Senator Mullen said.  Before I engage in the debate, I will say that I am in favour of an interview-type system but as the witnesses explained, the practicalities of that would be challenging.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated, such a system has an inherent potential for bias.  At the same time, I believe that it is the ideal.  As Senator Mullen asked, why can we not strive for the ideal?<\/p><p>Then again, I find the teacher in me questioning what can be learned in 15 minutes that could not be explained or examined by a teacher over two years, six years or whatever the case may be during senior cycle.  It is worthwhile having the debate but the practicalities of it weigh heavily on me.<br\/><br\/>In relation to Professor Hegarty's comments on the Irish language, unfortunately, I spent 15 years teaching the language as a secondary school teacher.  I have my own opinions as to where it falls down and what we can do better, but the one statistic that sticks out is that 58% or 59% of leaving certificate students took Irish last year as a leaving certificate examination subject.  Between exemptions and students dropping out, it is obvious that students are voting with their feet when it comes to Irish and the numbers doing it are not what they should be for a compulsory subject.  That is something we need to reflect on when we are talking about leaving certificate reform.  I have my own opinions on Irish.  The bonus point route is something that needs to be looked at.  We need to give value to it, as we did with mathematics in the past, including by introducing applied mathematics as a distinct course.  Perhaps we could introduce an applied Irish course.  There is merit in studying that option because we need to place a value on Irish.<br\/><br\/>While I am on the topic of value, I listened upstairs with amusement to the debate on apprenticeships.  Part of me thinks that if we offered apprenticeship courses that required 400 or 500 points in the leaving certificate, people would be beating down the doors to get on to the courses, such is their enthusiasm for the points race.<br\/><br\/>I have a few questions, which the witnesses can answer in any order they like.  The first concerns Irish.  I note that in its submission, the ETBI, made reference to the junior certificate reform.  Like the ETBI in its submission, I welcomed the reform of Irish at junior certificate level.  It gives students more variety, it uses technology and has presentation built into it, but it is much more difficult than the previous junior certificate Irish course.  I believe the ETBI stated that it is acting as a &quot;deterrent&quot; for people down the line to continue Irish to leaving certificate.  I ask the witnesses for their opinion on junior certificate reform, the impact it has had on Irish as a junior certificate cycle subject, and the issues I spoke about previously in respect of leaving certificate Irish.<br\/><br\/>My second question is addressed to the ETBI.  In its submission to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on the senior cycle review, it stated: <\/p><blockquote>\tCognisance should be taken in any reform of those students likely to be left behind for reasons not always academic.  Any reforms should not further burden, by default, an already disadvantaged cohort. <\/blockquote><p>I ask the witnesses to expand on that commentary.  Is it referring to making extra provision for disadvantaged children and people from disadvantaged backgrounds or those with special educational needs?<br\/><br\/>My third question relates to the comment I made about apprenticeships.  What can we do to make them more attractive to students?  My brother became a fabricator by profession.  It is about earning potential and the value some people place on jobs.  As a fabricator, my brother earned much more than I did as a teacher.  However, I do not think that message has got out to wider society.  <br\/><br\/>My fourth question relates to the modules and credits system that some of the witnesses have spoken about.  I think it is a great idea.  Going back to the issue of Irish, in the case that students went to the Gaeltacht for a period of time, whether for six weeks or eight weeks, I always advocated for that to be accredited as part of their result.  Can that approach be built into other subjects?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#W01000","speaker":"1521","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I will work backwards.  The modules and credits type system is common enough.  I refer to it as part of the leaving certificate applied.  It is a model of assessment that works well.  It is time-consuming but the positive for students is that it is a form of formative assessment that can be used to build them towards their result and guide them to improve their performance as they go along.  There is certainly a lot of merit to it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has answered the question on apprenticeships himself.  If a course required 450 points or 500 points on the CAO system, people would beat the doors down to get on to it.  That is the reality to a certain extent.  Apprenticeships tend not to be considered until all the other options have been looked at.  That is what is killing them.  In Germany, and particularly in Austria, apprenticeship is on the same par as any other option.<\/p><p>In those countries, it is possible to work one's way from an apprenticeship back into university to do an honours degree and then a masters or PhD degree down the road.  If an answer is desired in this regard then, there it is to a certain extent. <\/p><p> Regarding the disadvantage, it is concerned with targeted supports.  We find this a great deal in Youthreach.  Elements like information technology and literacy and numeracy are key.  There is no question about that.  Guidance and supports are in place now for students within the Youthreach family as well.  Those aspects have become very important in recent years because it has become more complicated for young people to thread their way through the \"system\", particularly in the last decade or so.  Having that guidance capacity to help students to thread their way through the process has become crucial.  <\/p><p> Turning to the query on the Irish language, I do not want to comment too much on that issue because it may be more of a second-level issue and I am here not as a former principal but as a representative of Youthreach.  To a certain extent, however, the level of Irish required in the leaving certificate applied is concerned with everybody achieving a certain level of competency.  The difficulty with Irish in the leaving certificate perhaps lies in doing Irish and achieving points being linked together.  As was suggested, perhaps some kind of applied Irish could be used to gain points but, equally, it would also be ensured that everybody would have a certain standard of Irish, which could perhaps be examined in transition year.  This debate might be similar to splitting English into English language and English literature as students progress.  That approach might be a way to encourage Irish, because it would be possible to have expectations of a level slightly lower than leaving certificate Irish while ensuring that everyone would have that standard.  Those who then wished to use the language to gain points could then go on and develop that over the last two years while in school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Whyte","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan for his questions.  I will comment on just a few points and allow others to come in.  Regarding the Irish language, I wonder whether the problem is focused on education or if there is a much broader issue that we must examine.  I refer to the context and use of the language.  Senator Mullen talked about the incentivised aspect and mention was also made of the use of the language.  Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about the love of the language.  That is the important point.  I was taken by an interview I heard with An tUachtar&aacute;n yesterday morning on the deaths of Brendan Kennelly and M&aacute;ire Mhac an tSaoi.  He talked about Ms Mhac an tSaoi's passion for the language.  Irish was how she expressed what she really believed.  It was not just that the language is a beautiful thing and our heritage, but that it is appropriate for and connected to us.  Our sense, however, as the Deputy said, of the language from the education system is of it being utilitarian and a bit of a drag, to be honest.  That point brings us back to questions regarding the beauty of Irish and how we might think about that perspective.  Equally, there is the aspect of how we might use the language.<\/p> <p>  I have spent a fair amount of my time assisting people in things like programme development for third level.  One of the big issues, and this goes back to a comment from Senator Mullen, is the challenge of what to leave out in developing the content of such programmes.  There is a desire to have many elements in such programmes.  It is not a case of adding on different modules because of a need to have certain skills.  Senator Mullen spoke about the skills we are missing.  What is being attempted is trying to add those skills in as an integrated part of a programme.  I refer to capabilities such as software skills, team working, interpersonal skills, etc.  Those elements are not intended to form part of a distinct module but to be built into the rest of the programme.  The reason I mention that point in this context, in responding to the question from Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, is that from the perspective of students, and we spoke of a student-centric approach being at the heart of this endeavour,  if they are not seeing the beauty of the language and the utility of the language, then I do not think that any number of incentives will change the situation.  Again, as a former Irish teacher, the Deputy will doubtlessly have his own views on this issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan for expressing that point about the Irish language far more eloquently than I tried to do.  I will address two points made by Deputy P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan, that of apprenticeships and then the fabricator.<\/p> <p>  On apprenticeships, the question asked was what we need to do to encourage them.  We must look at what we are investing in the various streams.  If a student is doing four years in university or any higher education institution now, then typically we are talking about investing approximately &euro;11,000, on average, for each year, depending on the specific course undertaken.  The student pays about &euro;3,000 of that cost, or a little more on occasion.  The State, then, is investing about &euro;8,000 a year and approximately &euro;32,000 over the duration of a higher education course.<\/p><p>If the State wants to promote apprenticeships, then it must invest more in them.  One impediment limiting the number of apprenticeships is that employers must sign contracts for a minimum of two years, which is the shortest time for an apprenticeship programme, and probably for an average of three to four years.  Employers must make that commitment, and getting enough employers to make such a commitment in this marketplace is probably easier than it would be in a different labour marketplace.  The chief executive of SOLAS has suggested that the State should pay for the day that apprenticeship students spend in education each week because employers get no benefit from their employees on that day.  It would also be possible to argue that employers are getting limited benefit from their apprentices in that first year and the State should also consider a subvention of the cost of apprenticeships in that first year, bearing in mind that employers are making a four-year commitment.  There is a need for the State to balance the investment being made in different streams of education and to consider supporting apprenticeships financially.<\/p><p> Turning to the point concerning Deputy O'Sullivan's brother working in fabrication, his huge earning potential and the Deputy&rsquo;s own 15 years teaching Irish, all I can say in answer is look at the Deputy now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Diarmuid Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I would say there is more money in fabrication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#Z00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I will not say that politicians engage in a certain amount of that activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#Z00300","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Those 15 years will come back to serve the Deputy well.

I agree with the remarks made earlier by my colleagues in this regard, but we also must broaden our understanding of what apprenticeships are.  The perception of apprenticeships is often very traditional.  One of our members, the University of Limerick, UL, last year launched an immersive software programme, which is, essentially, an apprenticeship.  It is a four-year programme, consisting of two years in full-time in college and then two years working in industry.  Ten or 12 of the leading technology companies have signed up to take part in that programme.  The students on that course work on-site in those companies more or less full time.  The programme is not called an apprenticeship, but it is an apprenticeship model to all intents and purposes.  Therefore, we must broaden our understanding of apprenticeships in that way.  That is just one example and others are emerging.  There are not enough of them, though, but examples are emerging, especially in the technology sector.  We need more endeavours like that.

It was interesting to listen to the answers to questions posed by my colleagues.  I hope I will not be repeating too much, but we do develop themes as we go through meetings.  I firmly believe that we must have a form of secondary school education that looks more like a transition year every year.  Education, and secondary school in particular, is fundamentally about the transition from school to adult life.  Young people want to be valued members of society and they want to practise what adult life is like.  The current school system does not allow that, beyond that brief period in transition year.  All the students love that aspect because it is about reaching out and experiencing life outside school.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on that point.  I ask for their comments in this regard because the fundamental reason people do not take up apprenticeships is in school they are practising an academic way of being in the world and then they continue that approach outside of school.  They see that as being what they are supposed to do.  We must ensure that what happens in school looks more like apprenticeship programmes to encourage people to choose apprenticeships after school.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to hear the views of the witnesses regarding having an approach to the leaving certificate that is more akin to mentorships.<\/p><p>I think work is being done on that, particularly for the junior certificate, but if we took that approach of people who are expert in particular skills mentoring young people, it might bring us closer to where we need to be.<\/p><p> I wonder about the number of subjects.  This comes up quite a lot.  There is an argument there about greater specialisation and I wonder what the witnesses think.  We have a long history of specialisation in subjects.  We do not get enough from half an hour or an hour of a subject per day.  We probably need young people to start choosing what they want to study much earlier.<\/p><p> As for the question of doing interviews, according to PhDs or even witnesses in legal cases, people from outside Ireland often address the fact that we are a very close-knit community and there may be bias.  Is there some merit in looking at that and widening the net if that is the route we are to go down?  Continuous assessment probably makes a bit more sense because, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, I am not sure what can be got from somebody in 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#Z00800","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  They are much appreciated.<\/p> <p>  I referred to the question of transition year earlier.  Transition year will certainly be a big part of the discussion.  I anticipate that this will come through in the NCCA report, although we will wait and see.  I was teaching at second level when transition year was introduced and I recall the great possibility and opportunity but also the question of how we were going to fill the year.  Things have moved on a great deal since then.  The question for the committee and for all who are interested in this is whether we could do more with the huge opportunity that is transition year.  The committee may remember that transition year was introduced for a slightly different reason.  Back then it was a time of very high unemployment and there was perhaps a different motivation to it.  That has changed.  We fully agree on that.<\/p> <p>  The mentorship approach is a helpful idea.  The Senator is correct about the idea of bringing people in from outside and that connection back into real life.  Maybe it is a question of how that might best be done.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the question of the number of subjects and greater specialisation.  I am struck by the fact that when one comes into third level, if I could approach it from that angle, there are technical skills associated with every domain within third level but, beyond that, it goes back to the softer skills Senator Mullen was thinking about.  What informs them all is the question of critical thinking and building a faculty for judgment, selection, etc.  A good third-level programme will do that regardless of where the student is.  Therefore, as to the question of the number of subjects at second level, if those particular skills are being inculcated, and if that can be done with a deeper dive in those skills that allows more space, including for critical thinking, it seems to me better to prepare someone for that transition.  That will be the big focus, I would have thought, for the committee.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Senator for her questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Throughout the 50 years I talked about earlier, I believe a teacher's job is not to give knowledge but to ask questions.  If the process that the student goes through in being taught is constantly asking and answering questions and constantly being brought through the thinking process in order to work things out for themselves, I think it will be found that that itself will develop the critical thinking facilities the Senator mentioned.  That is a matter of teaching technique.  That is a personal view.<\/p> <p>  I loved the Senator's description of school as a transition.  It was so apt and so eloquent.  It is exactly that.  It is a transition from childhood to adult life and one that should occur not in one year but in 12 years.<\/p><p>I think what the Senator was saying - I ask her to correct me if I am wrong - is that the transitional experience should not be concentrated in just one year of a student's education but should be there throughout.  I am in complete agreement with her.  The question, and Dr. Ryan's challenge, is to get the balance between giving students the specific technical skills they need along with the transitional experience.  A lot of that is in the teaching style and how they are taught.  Whatever subject they are taught, they can still be taught to think.  That is probably the big challenge we as a country face.

One is that the process itself and the curriculum needs adjustment.  There are very good ideas around the table on that today.  However, that still gets to an end point, and the challenge of overcoming the absolute fixation - it is more than a temptation - on gaming the end point, whatever it is, also has to be addressed.  Whether it is an exam, an interview or whatever else, the potential for gaming is strong, and the gaming is driven probably much more by the parents, perhaps the parents of middle Ireland to which Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred earlier more than most, in terms of the ambitions for their sons or daughters.

One should be careful about what one looks for sometimes.  As for the idea of reducing the number of subjects to something closer to the English model, we should be cautious.  One of the powers of the leaving certificate model is that the intention is that students will have a broad education.  Asking people very early to reduce the number of subjects they will study might have inherent dangers.  The other thing is that children mature at different rates.  Very often what a child is interested in and good at at 14 or 15 is not what they are interested in or any good at at 17, and asking them very early to make those choices might open up difficulties.  The transition year can be explored a lot more.  The potential within transition year has not been explored.  We see this now in the youthreach model, for example, where they do a broader range of stuff.  We see some of the benefits of that because youthreach is perhaps much closer to a transition year experience than the traditional leaving certificate.  I would just put in those caveats.

There were two issues I wanted to look at as Chair of the committee, namely, school bullying and leaving certificate reform.  That was because of my experiences in both of them.  I was taken by a point from Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on people approaching the leaving certificate and being afraid.  I would say 75% or 80% of students approaching the it are afraid of what is there to face them.  When I was growing up, it was about doing the leaving certificate, going to college, getting a pensionable job and living happily ever after.  The student of today is totally different from the student five or ten years ago and, most definitely, the student when I did my leaving certificate in 1992.  <\/p> <p>  There is a parental responsibility when we talk about apprenticeships.<\/p><p>Most parents now want their children to go to college and to get a nice comfortable job.  They do not want them to be out in the rough and tumble of life.  They think that in doing an apprenticeship one never knows what one will end up with afterwards.  Professor Hegarty spoke about the nurse becoming the doctor.  It is a perfect example.  Why should the nurse not become the doctor?  There are many other areas where a person doing an apprenticeship can end up teaching the apprenticeship to students.  I believe we have to look at it differently.<\/p><p> I have a question for Mr. Whyte and then I will refer back to the other questioners.  How does he convince the parents and mentors of the student that apprenticeships are a great track to further education?  The only ones that offer that step are the vocational schools - the name of it has gone out of my head - whereby if students do not get enough points, they can do a PLC.  Personally, I think they are a little outdated.  They are much needed but a little outdated and need to be reformed as well.  I am interested to hear Mr. Whyte's response to that.  I want to come back to something else on the leaving certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#DD00600","speaker":"1619","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Can I throw a caveat in, because in Ireland we get a little fixated on certain things?  Apprenticeship is in; it is a big thing.  There are only 5,000 to 6,000 apprentices out of the huge number of approximately 80,000 school leavers each year, so it is quite a small number.  It is a very important one, and has always been.  We must be honest and say that most students are not going to think about apprenticeships or traineeships, which are a particular type of apprenticeships that are sometimes more suitable.  The key thing is the attitude, and parents must take certain responsibility for that.  As parents, we do not really see apprenticeship as a valid option until our children have explored virtually everything else that is on the table.  I mentioned earlier, somewhat jocosely, that perhaps it should be put through the CAO system, put 400 or 500 points on it and then, from a career guidance point of view, it would become the same as doing a BComm, a BBS or a science course.  Unfortunately, until that happens and given the way Irish people think, it is just not going to go there.  In the short term, we have a shortage of apprentices at present and we are trying to backfill those, but that will pass again and we will go back to it.  The blunt answer is that it has to become a viable leaving certificate option for people, if one wishes to achieve that.<\/p> <p>  Another point you made, Chairman, about the nurse and the doctor was very interesting.  It is quite common in certain countries in Europe, particularly France and Germany, for somebody to start with an apprenticeship or skills-based learning when he or she leaves the formal secondary school and work his or her way up.  In fact, two chief executives of large motor companies in Germany started on the shop floor in those companies and worked their skills up over the years.  They both ended up with PhDs and as chief executives of those companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Whyte"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I fundamentally disagree with Mr. Whyte on one point.  This is what, in fact, is part of the gaming.  The system has been gamed not just by students but also by institutions.  Institutions have established very narrow courses where the demand for those courses has exceeded the number of places, and, of course, they have pushed up the points.  The institution becomes a high-points institution.  When Mr. Whyte says to put apprenticeships on the CAO and give them 500 points, I fear that what we are doing is playing to the value system of the parent.  That is not what apprenticeships are about.  Apprenticeships require completely different skills from what are currently imparted by the leaving certificate and, therefore, somebody who emerges with high points in the leaving certificate might not be suited.  It might not be the qualification one needs for an apprentice.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with Mr. Whyte on the point that apprenticeships have to be better regarded.  I do not know if the answer is that they will become better regarded by parents through giving them high points.  It is somehow a system whereby more publicity is given to the example Mr. Whyte gave of the leaders in Germany, there is a far greater profile to apprenticeships and giving examples of how people in apprenticeships have progressed to the top of major multinational organisations in other countries.<\/p><p>I would say that is the way.

That seems to be a contract worth discussing.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the issue raised by Deputy Conway-Walsh, again, my heart goes out to the individual in question.  I do not know the case but one might have seen an individual who wanted to do medicine originally, may not have succeeded in entry because of what we just discussed and went that related route.  The biomedical course is a superb course and we have seen the impact of it - never more so than in the past couple of years.  There is something about perceptions around different roles.  In respect of the HPAT route, there is a question about trying to get a broader input into medicine so medicine is possibly more reflective of the society.  That was seen to be important.  There is a conversation there.  I do not know whether the committee is going to meet with the professional bodies because they would have a significant input into this sort of consideration.  It might be worth considering.<\/p> <p>  If we go back to the question about looking at this from a student's perspective, while we must think of our economy and, of course, we are investing public money in this to develop our people, if we are developing our citizens to be the best they can be and if we are realising the potential of our citizens, we are doing a good thing, which itself would be best for the country and our system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#GG00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Conway-Walsh regarding a student loan scheme.  The learners we have in Youthreach can barely afford to attend a PLC course so the idea of having to take out a loan for college course would involve us effectively saying to 11% of the population \"forget it\" so I would be concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  The reality of leaving certificate reform is that it will ultimately come down to what we want the leaving certificate to do.  I spoke earlier about what it does at the moment.  If this committee or a group of public representatives can provide a policy or vision for what they think the leaving certificate must do in the future, particularly now we have two Departments, which creates a great opportunity, I believe Departments and the Minister must come in behind that.  I would be hopeful that the committee will find a solution to all our problems.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#HH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Whyte"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1634598000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Mullen concerning the prestige badge associated with the leaving certificate.  I think we have a cultural issue around this that needs to be overcome.  The argument for reserving places for students as a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for them staying in the workforce in Ireland is in principle one that should be explored.  As Dr. Ryan outlined, there are private companies doing that at the moment.  The banks and some tech companies do that on the basis that they will pay for someone's education if the person stays with them for a defined period of time.  I would have thought that this should be looked at.<br\/><br\/>I might broaden Deputy Conway-Walsh's question into a wider piece.  One of the challenges we have, and we have made submissions on this to Government in the wider context of funding, is the fact that students are very narrowly defined in the funding model for third level.  It tends to be framed around an 18 or 19-year-old coming out of secondary school, who, of course, make up the bulk of students.  Increasingly, we are seeing a much bigger cohort of mature students and part-time students coming into the system.  There is no appropriate funding model around them.  The question raised by the Deputy arising out of that email she quoted is very much in this realm because there is no natural mechanism for a student like that to be handled by the system.  In the reform of the funding model, one of the points we raised is that if we are serious about lifelong learning, and this is very much in the lifelong learning space, we must ensure the model caters for that in terms of the cash.  It is all very well to have a policy about lifelong learning but if the cash is not there to support it and the mechanism for that cash to flow is not there, it will not happen.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021101900002#HH00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Miley"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Miley, Dr. Ryan, Professor Hegarty and Mr. Whyte for attending today's meeting.

Given that so many amendments have been tabled, this will be the only time I will make general comments and I will thereafter stick to the specificity of the amendments as we go through them.  To expedite matters, I will speak to amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, as they are all, ultimately, related.<\/p><p>As we saw when we dealt with the general scheme in pre-legislative scrutiny, all members want this legislation to pass.  There is a universal acceptance that we absolutely need a good-quality, robust planning regime for the marine, alongside an appropriate agency with effective enforcement, not just because we urgently have to meet our 2030 renewable energy targets but also because it is the right thing to do.  Like the Minister of State, I acknowledge the very significant volume of work the officials have had to deal with, not just in regard to the Bill but over recent years.  They have been exceptionally helpful with members whenever we have asked for additional information, briefings and so on.<\/p><p>The challenge for us as a committee is that while a member can absolutely support the intention of a Bill, he or she will still want to play a role in scrutinising it thoroughly to ensure that when we get to the other side, the Bill and the mechanisms it will put in place will do exactly what we all want it to do, namely, to allow for good decisions about maritime use.<\/p><p>A member will also want the Bill to allow for a good planning regime, particularly for offshore wind, but one that protects and secures our marine environment and biodiversity.  Those are quite challenging things.  I was saying to the Chair at the start that one of the challenges for us is that this is incredibly complex.  It is certainly the most complex legislation I have encountered in my five years here.  We are trying to put in place almost four strands of a system - licensing, consents, the agency itself and enforcement - all of which must operate in a complex and comprehensive EU and domestic legislative framework as well as a cumbersome and complex planning framework.  I probably am saying all of that by way of a caveat so that if some of the amendments, as I go through them, are less coherent than I would like them to be it is merely because this is genuinely taxing, certainly for those of us on this side of the Chamber.<\/p><p> I still have the two concerns I have had from the start.  Many of the amendments I have tabled seek to give the Minister of State the opportunity to put on the record of the committee his responses to those concerns.  Depending on those responses, I may well withdraw my amendments if the answers are satisfactory.  There are some areas - these will be small in number - where the Bill could be improved.  Obviously, I hope that the Minister of State will take on board the spirit, if not the letter, of the amendments and come back.  All of my amendments are tabled - other colleagues' amendments would be the same - on the basis of trying to strengthen the legislation.<\/p><p> To reassure the Minister of State, we had a lengthy discussion earlier today on working to progress this legislation as quickly as possible while giving it the maximum amount of time.  The Minister of State will note the committee will be forthcoming in giving time to get through the Bill quickly but without scrimping on the necessary scrutiny.<\/p><p> On these first three amendments, like a lot of planning legislation, there are many areas where the outworkings of the legislation will depend on commencements and commencement dates.  In many areas, there is a lack of clarity on what the Government's intention is with respect to commencements.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related.  Amendment No. 3 speaks to the same issue, which is around the commencements of the maritime spatial plans set out in Part 2, Chapter 2, and when they will be commenced.  Obviously, they are crucial to many other aspects of the consents, the licensing and, ultimately, planning decisions.  There is also the issue of the marine planning framework review.  Given that some people still have some concerns about the content of that, it would make sense that we have clarity not only about commencements with respect to the maritime spatial plans, but also the interaction of the review with this section and related sections of the Bill.<\/p><p> There is a related issue around the role of the Oireachtas in all of this.  I refer to the question of whether the Oireachtas simply gets a copy of something or has a formal role in amending or approving it.  Therefore, there is a role for greater provision, as in amendment No. 3, for opportunities for the Oireachtas to debate fully those related matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#A00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Likewise, I will do my best to make sure things move quickly while seeking to do our job well and give the Bill the scrutiny it needs.<\/p> <p>  By way of brief opening comment before I get into the amendments, this is a very important Bill.  It is long overdue.  It is needed.  I have concerns about the protection of our fragile marine environment and whether this Bill will be sufficient in that regard.  I have concerns that, as with all development and planning processes, our approach to date in this country has been too developer-led, especially in terms of the marine environment, and that this Bill does not go sufficiently far to ensure it is not developer-led.  There was good correspondence from the Coastal Concern Alliance today which made the point that the best international practice is for countries to screen areas, pick sites for wind energy development and tender for those sites to be used, and that we have taken the opposite approach where it has been developer-led and developers have picked sites.  I would strongly share the alliance's concerns on this.<\/p> <p>  I am very concerned as well that we do not have the marine protected areas planned and mapped out.  We are meant to have 30% of our areas protected by 2030 and to date only 2% of them are.  It would be useful to hear from the Minister of State, in particular, on all of our amendments, exactly what will happen in terms of marine protected areas, what progress has been made and when we will get those designations in place because that relates to many of the concerns I have about the Bill and the processes.<\/p> <p>  In relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I refer specifically to the maritime spatial plans and when Part 2, Chapter 2 will come into operation.  My amendments seek to ensure it will come into operation on the enactment of the Bill.  The maritime spatial plans, the considerations which inform them, the requirements for them in relation to the review of the NMPF and the public participation requirements, and how they are approved by the Oireachtas, all are important.  Given that the NMPF will be an input into the decision-making process in respect of a range of matters under the Bill, it is important that it is urgently reviewed and that the overall architecture and requirements of the marine spatial plans for our marine environment are addressed.  It is critically important that these actions will not be delayed through these provisions not being commenced.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 seeks to ensure the review of the current NMPF is done under section 17(2) before it is used to inform a range of matters, such as the designated maritime area plans, DMAPs, the maritime area consents, MACs, and the decisions under the planning Act.<\/p> <p>  I apologise because I will be stepping out for a few minutes to move a Bill in the D&aacute;il.

Construing a term in accordance with two different directives is not appropriate due to the risk of the use in different contexts and the potential for divergence and inconsistency, which would create potential practical issues as attendant legal risks.

The great value of putting an ecosystems-based approach at the heart of everything we are doing is that it is a systems-based approach.  Everything and how it interrelates with everything else becomes fundamental.  It seems to me that because this is planning legislation, things may get challenged legally at some point in the future.

To exclude holiday periods, Christmas periods, bank holidays and so on, as this amendment proposes, is essentially a means of ensuring things do not pass by the public which could significantly impact upon them.

I have not tabled an amendment on this point, but I certainly will on Report Stage.  When we are doing public consultations, as well as having to put things in a national newspaper or on a website, there should be radio advertisements from the Department or the Government on such matters.  We regularly hear such material being broadcast to the public in respect of something of significance, including things to do with public health and some social welfare matters.  In the case of this legislation, a review of the NMPF or a marine spatial plan should be advertised, just as we regularly hear other matters being advertised.  Many people do not buy <i>The Irish Times<\/i>or the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>these days.  Much of the time people are completely unaware of these notices.  There should be radio advertisements.  Maybe we should consider social media as well, although I am slightly reluctant to encourage more use of social media, to be honest.  Radio advertisements can be quite effective.

I suspect the Minister of State will break the bad news to us shortly that he will not accept the amendment.  Nevertheless, it would be good if, elsewhere in the legislation, the Government made clear that in all aspects of the work of the various bodies and processes outlined in the Bill, whether regarding licensing, consent, planning or policy, the organisations listed in the amendment will, along with others, be central to everything that happens.

My concern, and that of a lot of people, is that we are pushing through legislation which is about facilitating development rather than starting with the proper mapping out of what should and should not happen, where it should happen and when it should happen in the marine environment, and having proper consultation around all of that.  In our opinion, consultation has not happened to the degree that it should.  We want to see this Bill remedy that as much as possible and ensure that all of those who have an interest in protecting our heritage, marine environment, fisheries, tourism and the general environment are properly consulted as a matter of course on those issues, as well as NGOs and stakeholders who have a real stake in decisions that might be made that impact on the maritime area.  It is reasonable that it should be set out who they are and the minimum requirements to consult with them.<\/p><p>It is not clear to me who exactly the Minister has to consult with in terms of the granting of MACs, which is what they are called now.  I will understand more as we go through the Bill, but as far as I understand it, the suggestion is that a MAC does not attract environmental and public participation obligations.  I do not accept that for a moment.  It does and should.  The problem we have is that developers have essentially selected their own sites, grabbed them and it becomes a <i>fait accompli <\/i>.  Somewhere further along the line we apparently rubber-stamp them, having vetted them, but it is all too late in reality.  We want to see all of those gaps plugged to guarantee that we do planning in a proper, sustainable manner in line with EU directives on spatial marine planning and get things in the right order.

For example, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Heritage Council are unlikely to be consulted regarding a development proposal 100 km offshore.  In addition, specifying bodies in primary legislation creates practical difficulties, as further primary legislation would be required to amend where titles or functions of bodies change over time.  As is normal practice, the prescription of bodies will be done through secondary legislation.  I can assure the Deputies of that.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, the advisory group I have chaired represents the entire maritime community.  Unfortunately, through Covid, we did not physically get to meet, but in the online meetings it was incredible to see the number of individuals and bodies present and taking an interest in the process.

It may be the view of the Minister or his officials that an organisation may not want to be consulted on a particular aspect of the outworking of this legislation, but if it is not listed as a prescribed organisation in the necessary statutory instrument, it will not get the opportunity.  I ask the Minister of State to be as generous as possible to ensure as many organisations as possible are listed because, in particular in the early stages, the greater the level of participation, the better everyone will be.  We will pay close attention to the statutory instruments when they come out, but it would be very positive, and it would signal the Government's intent to ensure those organisations that are statutorily tasked with the variety of functions that are listed here will be given a central role as prescribed bodies to the maximum extent possible.

It is a very safe system in that sense, in that none of the prescribed bodies that may have a view misses out on the opportunity to give it.  Prescribed bodies are given lots of opportunities, but they only have so many resources and they must prioritise when something arises.  I would caution against assuming that a body should have no role or say.  It works better if the organisations make the decision in terms of their own priorities and resources as to whether they have an interest or not.  I accept that the further out we go, the less relevant it will be to some of the bodies whose main interests are closer to shore, but I would be cautious about taking too fixed a position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#F00500","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634598000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, line 7, after &ldquo;record&rdquo; to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;, but a record shall not be confused with information held, particularly for the purposes of Directive 2003\/4\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90\/313\/EEC or the Freedom of Information Act 2014&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>We all have lots of experience of the trials and travails of freedom of information, FOI, requests.

The Minister of State may say that is not the case but that is what they believe.  They believe the selection by developers of sites such as the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank, which are their fishing grounds and are spawning grounds for fish, makes the development of large-scale wind infrastructure on a very sensitive site a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.<\/p><p>The perception is that the Government wants to find the legislative means to facilitate that, rather than take on board their concerns.  Their concerns about how planned developments on the Kish Bank will take place have not been taken on board.  Similar views are held by groups like Save our Seafront and the Coastal Concern Alliance.  There is a group in Waterford that has similar concerns about the impact of development that close to shore and on particular sites.  There has not been a consideration of all the potential impacts on everything from heritage to fishing to the tourism amenity to the biosphere in Dublin Bay.  We could go through a list of things that are potentially impacted by something of that close proximity.<\/p><p> I would be interested to hear the Minister of State respond to those concerns.

While noting the positive intention of the proposal, it is not necessary to itemise any particular category of the public, as well as all captured the broad term &ldquo;members of the public&rdquo; in subsection 4(b).  While fishing representative bodies and coastal community groups are commonly understood terms, neither is defined for the purposes of this Bill.  Throughout the four-year consultation period on the National Marine Planning Framework, we were always mindful of respecting equally all members of the maritime community.  That is right and proper.  We must be careful in this legislation not to state that one category of the public is more important than another.  This would only lead to exclusion.  In public consultations such as this, the procedure must be neutral.  There must be equality of opportunity for all to contribute and to be heard.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 39 proposes additional considerations in the development of the statement that appeared to fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of the statement as a high-level expression of Government policy.

Four weeks is a short period of time.  We are not dealing with a standard planning application.  We are dealing with things that can often be complex, both from a technical and scientific point of view.  Many of us would have met with, for example, the National Inshore Fishermen's Association.  The Minister of State is right that it was contacted and invited to a number of the consultations and participated in them.  Its members told us, and I am sure they have conveyed the same to the Minister of State and his officials, they feel that their capacity is small, because it is a small organisation comprising fishermen.  Their capacity to engage is more diminished than larger corporate organisations or various other bodies.  Four weeks is therefore a short period of time for those organisations.  They themselves have told us that they do not have the capacity or the technical expertise needed.<\/p> <p>  One could argue that they are members of larger organisations that represent wider sections of the fishing industry.  While that is true, the Minister of State knows as well as I do that there are disagreements, tensions, and divergences of interests.  Again, the National Inshore Fishermen's Association has stressed to us that it needs to be given the maximum opportunity to engage in this process.<\/p> <p>  I would ask the Minister of State to actively consider, between now and Report Stage, whether the length of time that has been provided for in section 5(5)(b)(iii) is sufficient.  In addition, how does one ensure that those smaller organisations or communities are not just given a notional right to participate, but that their participation is genuine and meaningful, given their own self-declared limited technical and scientific resources?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#J01100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

My big concern is that the marine environment is an enormous area that some people stand to potentially make a lot of money out of.  Let us call a spade a spade.  There were some disastrous mistakes made on land with planning and development, where money had a disproportionate, sometimes corrupt, influence on planning and development on land.<\/p><p>There were many dire consequences of that.  It contributed to arguably the greatest economic crash the country has ever seen, as well as the disastrous austerity that followed and the housing crisis we face today.  We could go through the disastrous consequences of letting money dictate what went on, in planning and development terms, in respect of land.  The potential for that to be replicated at sea is significant.  The vested interests are lining up and are so far ahead of the public in their working to further their interests in order to make money from the marine environment.  As a result, we have to tip the scales greatly in favour of the general public and stakeholders that do not have the resources large corporations and big industry have to pursue their own commercial interests.<\/p><p> When we talk about coastal development, the people who have a guardianship role are, self-evidently, the coastal communities that immediately adjoin the area in question.  I do not suggest that other people who do not immediately adjoin a particular development do not have a right - they absolutely do - but the coastal communities have a special guardianship role and that is important.  It is not just that they have the right to do it; in fact, I want them to do it because I do not trust what certain interests, left to their own devices, might do without the oversight of communities that are directly affected, understand what a coastal zone and so on are and can spot what others who might not live nearby would not see.  They have an especially important role in that regard.  Similarly, the fishers have been there for a long time and know the marine environment.  They know which marine species are operating there and the geography of the area.  Moreover, they make their livelihoods from it and should have the right to continue to do so and not be impacted by other people who just want to make money from the marine environment.<\/p><p> It is entirely justified, therefore, to guarantee that certain people who clearly have a stake and a role in ensuring the proper and sustainable planning and development of the marine environment will have that role, notwithstanding the need to give everybody the right to have input into decisions about the marine environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#J01300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I note the comments of all the Deputies.

Amendment No. 32 will provide for those statements to require approval by the Oireachtas.  Marine planning policy statements are a significant part of the overall architecture.  I am concerned about the role of the Oireachtas in that, as the Bill stands, the statements will simply be required to be laid before the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>So apart from being laid before it, the Oireachtas will not have a role in this.  It is effectively for the Minister to do.  I have a lot of concerns about that in terms of the democratic process given that these are significant and have an impact on the architecture of the legislation, how this process works and how the marine policy is set down.  I am also concerned about how that could lead to judicial action relating to the Bill and the role of the Oireachtas, particularly in respect of Article 15(2) of the Constitution and other case law around that.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's view on that.<\/p><p> I have concerns about the level of ministerial discretion on marine planning policy statements and the lack of Oireachtas oversight.  I have concerns about the lack of public participation in terms of the Minister's actions.  I also have concerns about when the policy statements come into effect and about significant deficits in terms of environmental assessment requirements on the marine planning policy statements.  Could the Minister of State elaborate on the process for environmental assessment when drawing up these statements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#K02700","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Before I deal with the amendments, I think it would be really useful if before the Minister of State responds to our questions about the amendments, he gives the committee a plain English explanation of what the marine planning policy statement is, its function and role.  I am particularly interested because we have a national marine planning framework and will have marine protected areas, designations and a variety of other plans.  Where does the policy statement fit into that overarching legal and policy architecture.  What is it going to do, what is its added value and, crucially, how does it relate to all of those?<\/p> <p>  As will become clear as we go through later Stages of the Bill, there is real concern, and I echo Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's remarks.  I presume this is a statement of some significance, particularly given the length of time it is due to run for.  I would not in any way question the Minister's intentions but giving the Minister the power to introduce such a significant statement without adequate public consultation and access to strategic environmental assessments or appropriate assessments, particularly in the absence of an adequate designation of Natura 2000 sites, has implications for any real functional role for the Oireachtas.  There was very extensive consultation when the national planning framework - the terrestrial planning framework - was being done in the previous Oireachtas and Department officials worked very hard.  However, there was no formal role outside of briefings and informal engagements on and off the record.  There was no formal role.  In fact, there was some controversy at the end because despite the fact that the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who introduced the legislation, said that it was always his intention for there to be a vote of the Oireachtas, the subsequent Government and Minister interpreted the legislation differently and said there would be no vote.  That became a large bone of contention.  <\/p> <p>  Could the Minister of State outline his general thoughts on those?  My arguments regarding the amendments are similar to those of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  Something of this significance should get Oireachtas approval.  If the Minister of the day is satisfied that he or she has done his or her work properly, he or she should be able to easily get it through an Oireachtas vote.  I also think there should be a mechanism for Oireachtas amendments - I took the same position with the terrestrial planning framework - but also for the revocation of any such policy statement, particularly in the context of a change of Government.  <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 32 speaks to the issue of a timeframe.  In so many other areas of legislation, particularly in planning, the production of policy statements or guidelines can take far longer than they could or should.  I do not want to mention the war of the rural planning guidelines, which were much delayed both before the Minister of State was in office and are still delayed, but that is just one example of how very complex issues can end up taking far longer than they need to.  This creates planning uncertainty, which is not good for anyone.  <\/p> <p>  I will fall over backwards if the Minister of State considers accepting Amendment No. 33 because it completely rewrites this section of the Bill.  What I and others are trying to do with this amendment is set out a more comprehensive primary legislative basis for what that policy statement should be but also respecting the primacy of a number of key EU directives also highlighting what happens if at a later stage, there is a conflict between, for example, the revised marine planning framework and the marine spatial planning directive.  Where does that conflict play itself out?  By putting down these baskets of obligations in my amendment involving section 3(a), (b) and (c), I am trying to give clarity to that and detail who should be consulted in all of those.<\/p> <p>  Likewise, amendment No. 34 is a small amendment but it strengthens the need for compliance with the relevant sections rather than \"have regard to\".  We all know the difficulties involved in the difference between \"comply with\" and \"have regard to\" when it comes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding SDZs, something we are trying to remove from terrestrial planning legislation.  It would be good not to have that same weakness in this Bill.  This group of amendments goes up to amendment No. 38 and also includes amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 45.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#L00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#L00300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":536,"content":"<p>At the risk of the Minister of State losing the will to live listening to me talking to my other amendments-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#L00400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 45 remain to be covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#L00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 45 are really about significantly strengthening the role of the Oireachtas through the committee structure, not just this committee but other relevant committees that may have input into what is ultimately a cross-departmental and cross-Oireachtas committee set of issues, to give them adequate involvement in shaping this policy statement, and likewise the ability to introduce amendments.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 45 concerns the relationship between the maritime planning policy statement and other public bodies.

We have MACs, DMAPs, the NMPF, multiple directives and MARA and now we have these policy statements.  What is the acronym for them?  It is MPPS.  As a Deputy, I find this difficult.  If I was a member of the public, I would be baffled as to how this process will operate.  It would be very useful if a idiot's guide with a visual map of how these different elements interact could be produced.  In this case, we have a new acronym, which is the MPPS, which is the Minister making statements of principles.  How exactly do they relate to all the other different moving parts in this?  How do they relate to the national marine planning framework, which will be reviewed from time to time?  How will the national marine planning framework or the reviewed version of that framework be informed?  What will it be informed by?<\/p><p>To what extent will the statements of objectives and policies that the Minister might make be required to be compliant with the various directives?

A visual representation of these parts would be useful for us because we will be at this for weeks.  I know one cannot be produced overnight, but it would be helpful.<\/p><p> Ministers cannot make any old statement that throws everything in a particular direction just because that is what they like doing, or can they?  Who might be influencing a Minister when he or she is coming out with particular statements in respect of policies and objectives?  One of the amendments deals with the representations the Minister may receive.  We need to know about those if statements are being made.  Critically, we need to know that the governing framework for policy statements dictating how planning and development are done and what type of planning and development is done in our marine environment is informed, constrained and regulated by all of the various directives in terms of marine spatial planning, protection of biodiversity and habitats, and so on.  We need to know that the tail is not wagging the dog in how we undertake marine planning and development.<\/p><p> That is a brief summary of the logic behind this series of amendments.

It is a very good amendment.  I am biased, of course, as I submitted it and a number of others, but it would create a considerable amount of structure around marine planning policy statements.  If this amendment was inserted into the Bill now or, if the Minister of State is minded to improve the section and give more structure to it, on Report Stage, I would have much more confidence in this section.  Reading the current section, it does not give much information about marine planning policy statements.  It states that they will be there and they shall have regard to a few matters, but it does not provide a proper structure.  We do not know from the Bill when marine planning policy statements will be revoked and how they can be amended.  That is not clear.  If a new Minister makes a new statement, will that mean that the previous statements are then out of date?  If a Minister does something through a marine policy planning statement that is contrary to the majority wishes of the Oireachtas, will the Oireachtas have any ability to amend or revoke it or make an input into it?  What is the process in that regard?  As legislators, we must think about these questions in light of who the Minister might be.  The current Minister is one who has a keen interest in marine biodiversity, but what happens if there is a Minister who has no interest in the marine environment whatsoever and starts inserting all sorts of stuff into marine policy statements?  Could a Minister, through marine policy statements, create a large amount of damage to the marine environment by opening up avenues for mining activity or sand and gravel extraction, which have major implications for climate change?<\/p> <p>  I would welcome it if the Minister of State explained exactly where marine planning policy statements fit in with the rest of the Bill's architecture.  Where in the Bill is clarity provided in this regard?  What is the hierarchy?  Why not accept our amendment to ensure that the Minister must act explicitly in accordance with the objectives of the birds directive and Article 2 of the habitats directive?  Why not write that into the Bill in terms of marine planning policy statements just to make those aspects stronger and clearer?

We can break it down further with a mapping process, although that would not take away from the significant complexity of what we are trying to do.<\/p> <p>  I will address the technical aspects first and then make a few comments.  The marine planning policy framework is a high-level expression of Government policy prepared by the Minister and agreed across the Government by the Cabinet.  This is a ministerial function.<\/p> <p>  The statement is intended to do the following: describe the existing components of Ireland's marine planning system; outline a vision for the future development of our marine planning system; set out the overarching policies and principles that the Government expects marine planning bodies and other public bodies that engage with the marine planning system to observe, for example, public engagement, transparency, governance, environmental assessment, climate action, and social and economic benefit; and set out high-level priorities for the enhancement of the marine planning system in Ireland.  This grouping of amendments proposes instead to establish a mechanism going far beyond oversight and democratic approval, effectively resulting in an Oireachtas marine planning policy statement, MPPS.  The Oireachtas would be acting, in part, as a quasi-marine planning body.  With all due respect to the various competencies and experience of my Oireachtas colleagues, that is not an appropriate role for a national legislature.<\/p> <p>  The amendments proposed appear to confuse the marine policy statement with a maritime spatial plan through the inclusion of considerations and matters that can only be properly expressed in a detailed plan.  They are not appropriate for a high-level statement.  Further to this, the amendments proposed contain technical deficiencies that would create inherent impracticalities, legal issues and severe limitations.  The net effect would be to establish procedures that were simply inoperable.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 30 proposes to include an Oireachtas approval of the MPPS.  This is a Cabinet function.  Amendment No. 32 repeats the Oireachtas approval requirement in respect of the first MPPS.  Again, this is a Cabinet function.  Amendment No. 33 revises the considerations for the development of the MPPS.  The proposed subsection (3)(a) would require the Minister to \"act consistently with\" a number of matters.  \"Have regard to\" is the standard phrasing used and is well understood by the public, practitioners and the courts.  Such a novel departure would inevitably require interpretation and clarification by the courts, perhaps over multiple cases and years.  We cannot introduce such a risk.<\/p> <p>  Marine spatial planning is based upon balancing the three pillars of sustainable development: environmental, economic and social.  The proposed subsection (3)(a), while expansive on a single pillar of marine spatial planning, is silent on the other two.   This creates an imbalance and severely limits the scope of the statement to the point of inoperability.<\/p> <p>  The proposed subsection (3)(b)(ii) is technically deficient.  The use of the word \"it\" is ambiguous and may be construed as a statement or that this provision is cumulative with the proposed subsection (3)(b)(i), which refers to the NMPF.<\/p><p>The proposed section 3(b)(iii) appears to require the Minister to have regard to future maritime spatial plans not yet developed.  Section 3(b)(iv) and (v) would require a level of detail appropriate to a detailed maritime spatial plan, not a policy statement.  The proposed section 3(c) explicitly limits consultation to two Ministers and Ministers of State, in stark contrast to the ministerial consultation on the first MPPS that engaged all Ministers, particularly those with maritime functions.  I see no justification for such a limit and am surprised because it goes against the ethos of all our consultation to date.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 34 proposes to replace \"have regard to\" with \"must comply with\" for ministerial considerations in section 6(3).  This phrasing stands in contrast to the Deputies' use of \"have regard to\" in amendment No. 33.  It is important we remain consistent with the terms we use around planning.  As previously mentioned, the term \"have regard to\" is used throughout planning and it works.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 38 requires the Minister to have regard to interim measures to protect areas of marine environment as agreed by the Government.  I acknowledge the positive intentions of the amendment but it is not currently functional.  \"Interim measures\" has no legal meaning.  However, as detailed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in the Second Stage debate, we have undertaken to examine the possibility of using designated maritime area plans provisions of this Bill as an interim measure in advance of the MPA legislation.  Should this prove to be operable, there will be no need to refer to them as they are already fall under the definition of the national marine planning framework in section 2.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 42 proposes to establish Oireachtas engagement and public consultation procedures.  The Oireachtas procedure is unprecedented in scope and places something akin to a planning function on the Oireachtas.  I have proposed consultation procedures under amendments Nos. 31, 36, 37 and 46.  The public and Oireachtas Members and committees will be able to provide input into the development of the MPPS through this procedure.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 43 sets out further detail in relation to Oireachtas engagement procedure and relies upon section 6(3).  As detailed above, it is legally inoperable and contains multiple deficiencies.  Amendment No. 45 is a technical amendment relating to Oireachtas approval.  I oppose these amendments.<\/p><p> I support amendments No. 31, 36 and 37.  Ministerial amendment No. 31 is a technical amendment, necessary to facilitate additional provisions of amendment No. 46.  Ministerial amendment No. 36 is a technical amendment necessary to facilitate amendment No. 37.  Ministerial amendment No. 37 requires the Minister to have regard to representations made in public consultation.<\/p><p> In relation to the high level policy statement, I draw members' attention to page 27 of the Bill, where they will see detailed the requirements and those the planning policy statement has to have regard to.  It is also in terms of consultation, as I referenced in the amendments from No. 46.  Like our current planning policy, this is a high level expression statement at the top overarching our policy and it requires approval by the Cabinet.<\/p><p> I appreciate how complex this is.  It is the same for me as I try to grapple with all these terms and engagements.  I acknowledge the good faith being displayed by members in putting forward their amendments and I am willing to work with them on as many as I can.  I hope I demonstrated this from the start of the proceedings this afternoon.<\/p><p> The way I have broken it down for myself is that what we are doing involves three pillars.  There is forward planning, including the policy statement sitting on top, the national marine planning framework underneath it and the guidelines and directions that follow suit from that, as well as DMAPS, akin to local area plans in the current 31 local authority structure.  That will give a reflection of what it is like inland or an alternative snapshot.  The second pillar is development management, which is concerned with consents, giving licence to development and deciding whether it goes through An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authority, depending on where it is located or what environmental assessment is needed.  Enforcement is the last pillar and MARA will take a lead role in that.  Those are three pillars into which we have tried to break it down but I acknowledge it is a sizable and technical Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#M00600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>The policy statement comes at the top and that is the Government deciding what it wants to do.  Below that comes the marine planning framework.  Is that not what the Minister of State suggested?  I will consider what he said but my worries start there.  There are certain things that have to constrain our political whims concerning what might happen in the marine environment, namely, the need to meet certain obligations relating to biodiversity and environmental protection directives we are subject to and so on.  They are there to protect the public's right to participate in sustainable planning and development and to protect our environment, habitats, livelihoods and so on.  I am worried about that relationship.  The Minister of State said the Oireachtas cannot become a planning authority but the Minister will become a planning authority.  The Minister of State might like to come back on that point.  He might have concerns about the Oireachtas being a planning authority; I have significant concerns about a Minister being a planning authority.<\/p> <p>  Our development plans for local authority areas are far from perfect but they allow for fairly intensive public engagement and a democratic process for the designation of particular areas for particular activities.  That is done in an open, transparent and democratic way where elected representatives say houses can be build in such a place but not in another place because it is a protected environment, that a certain amount of land must be allocated for educational facilities, sport and so on, and certain things cannot be done in certain places.  Where are the guarantees that we will have a similarly democratic and transparent regime when it comes to the designation of different parts of the marine environment for different types of activities?  The public deserves an answer to that.  The fears are that we will not and Ministers will be able to dictate, possibly under the influence of lobbyists, that the marine area regulatory authority when established will not be fully transparent and that the issuing of licences, consents and so on will not involve a transparent, open process.

When the Minister of State comes to respond, I am really interested to know the following.<\/p><p>If the planning framework is the overarching planning framework for the marine, it has or should have a variety of spatial and temporal detail through its maps and so forth.  I am trying to work out what the policy statement is and how it interacts with that.  Is one guiding the other or is it a summary of the other?  It would be very helpful if the Minister of State could give greater clarity on that.<\/p><p> The second issue is a question I asked in the first round.  Will the drafting and approval by the Minister and the Cabinet of the policy statement require SEAs or AAs?  That is very important.  I am also unclear about what the full level of consultation is.  The Minister of State said he has outlined some of that in his amendments, but perhaps he can talk through that again in plain English.  What opportunities would the public have?<\/p><p> With respect to the role of the Oireachtas, I appreciate the Minister of State's view.  These might not be the exact words he used - I am paraphrasing and I apologise if I have got it wrong - but there was a suggestion that this might be too technical and too high level for the collective genius of the Members of the Upper and Lower Houses.  If that is the case, putting it as the responsibility solely of a Minister, albeit with Cabinet approval, creates even bigger problems.  The Minister of State is right that the extent of Oireachtas involvement is unprecedented.  We did that to make a point.  However, the point, which is a very legitimate one, is that the Minister of State has gone too far in the other direction.  There is an appropriate role to be given to the Houses of the Oireachtas and appropriate committees.  The Minister of State should consider that there were real benefits in the engagements on the national planning framework which was processed through the previous D&aacute;il, notwithstanding the fact that there were no votes, which was one of its weaknesses.  There was a level of engagement with that.  I know that is more akin to the marine planning framework, but I still believe there is some value in that.<\/p><p> I have a few more responses to the Minister of State's criticisms of our amendments, some of them justifiable.  Of course, there will always be technical deficiencies in Opposition amendments.  We would be delighted if the Minister of State would second some of his hard-working and expert staff to us at the time for drafting amendments.  It would enormously improve the quality of the amendments.  However, technical deficiencies can always be dealt with and cleaned up.  What is important is the intention of the amendments.  I do not accept the Minister of State's contention that \"shall have regard to\" is the standard in planning legislation.  In fact, local authorities must comply with the county development plans.  There is a clear difference between the onerous obligation placed on a planning authority with respect to a planning decision based on a county development plan and when a similar decision is appealed to the board and the board has to \"have regard to\".  They are fundamentally different propositions.  If \"have regard to\" is the Government's preference, that is its preference, but the reason we are suggesting having a hierarchy of \"comply with\" and \"have regard to\", particularly in the longer amendment which is better worded, is to cater for what happens if there is a conflict between, for example, the appropriate directive and the marine planning framework.  If there happens to be a conflict, which gets precedence?  The Minister is going to have to make a call as to which he or she must comply with as opposed to have regard to.<\/p><p> There is a genuine concern and we see it with the substitute consent debate.  I do not wish to conflate the two, but where there are conflicts between domestic legislation and EU legislation, particularly on issues of environmental protection, inadequately addressing how to process those through the system at the legislative stage can lead to all sorts of difficulties, including the very substantial fines that this Government is paying and the previous Government had to pay in respect of substitute consent related matters.<\/p><p> I forgot to raise something on the interim measures in the first round.  First, what the Minister of State said sounds very positive.  This amendment is deficiently drafted but the reason it is there is that, as the Minister of State knows, the third recommendation of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report was that: \"The Government implement interim measures to protect areas of the marine environment given the disparity between the introduction of the proposed legislation and the absence of legislation regulating maritime protected areas\".  I am more than happy to withdraw that amendment, but perhaps the Minister of State could give us a little more information, if he has it, on the discussions about those interim measures.  The committee was strongly of the view that such interim measures would be very important.<\/p><p> I want to ensure, Chairman, that I do not miss any of the points.  The Minister of State is consulting his officials.  His job is more difficult than ours.  We just have to ask the questions while he has to know what the answers are.<\/p><p> With regard to the more limited list of Ministers, it was not my intention to exclude any of the Minister of State's colleagues.  I would be happy to amend that on Report Stage and include the entire Cabinet in it, but the Minister of State can see the point we are trying to make.  How do we involve the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas committees and all the relevant Ministers?  Notwithstanding the technical deficiencies and accidental exclusions of the Minister of State's colleagues, I still believe there is merit in the Minister of State rethinking the role that he is not giving to the Oireachtas.  Perhaps some compromise might be forthcoming from the Government between now and Report Stage.<\/p><p> I am sure I have forgotten something but I will come back to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#N00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I will come back to you.

For example, the new section 3(3) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill does it.  I commend the Government for doing that in that Bill and recommend that it follows that good practice in this Bill.  It has set a good precedent.  It is very important, for the reasons that Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined.  There can be conflicts, so setting out clearly which come first and a hierarchy for them absolutely makes sense.  That would be a big improvement in the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 43 are key amendments.  There is no issue if they have to be cleaned up to make them technically more compliant.  Bear in mind that we had quite short notice of the deadline for submitting amendments, so I would be happy to work with the Minister of State if they have to be updated or cleaned up.  It is the principle of the amendments that we are trying to get across.  I believe they would strengthen the Bill considerably, so I ask for that to be considered.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the marine planning policy statement feeding into the national marine planning framework and the marine spatial plan.  Where does the Bill refer to how that feeds in or how they connect or what the relationship is?  Is that explicitly set out in the Bill and where is it?  If so, does that need strengthening?  Perhaps, Chairman, the Minister of State will answer that question and I will then continue.

It is all set out there.  It is not something made like in the wild west on the back of an envelope.  It must comply with all those aspects.<\/p> <p>  Second, as regards its role, I would use the words \"a shared vision\", in terms of breathing life into the national marine planning framework, and to have a new plan-led system as opposed to it being developer-led.  That is what we have with the national planning framework.  There is the overarching, high-level statement and a shared vision from the national planning framework right down to the local area plans, the county development plans and the regional plans, with the spatial plans above that.<\/p><p>It is a shared vision and that is what a Cabinet should and would be trying to establish when it is doing its high-level statement, namely, having regard to all that other stuff.  Section 6(1) sets out how the Government interacts with it through this Bill, so again, it is a high-level statement.  It is up to the Government to set out a high-level statement and then it is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to hold it to account for that statement and other legislation it enacts.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett was talking about DMAPS, jurisdiction and that aspect.  That is another section.  In two days, we will be going on to the DMAPS and local area plan aspects, as well as who has jurisdiction over it.  Whether or not it is in the local authority functional area it is about it being fully compliant with public participation at every single corner of it.  That is most important, just as terrestrial planning laws when a county development plan is being done and put forward in terms of zoning, and various different local area plans attached to it.<\/p><p> In relation to a question, I think from Deputy &Oacute; Broin, they are indeed subject to SEA and appropriative assessment.

It is self-evident that the amendment seeks to address concerns about lobbying.  We know that lobbyists operate for certain corporate and commercial interests operating or seeking to operate in the maritime area.  We want full transparency and visibility for lobbying that takes place around policy matters pertaining to the planning and development of the maritime area.

There is nothing wrong with lobbying, which is carried out by lots of different organisations, commercial organisations, NGOs, Deputies and Cabinet colleagues, etc.  I will show why amendment No. 40 would make everybody's life easier.  As the Minister of State will remember, we had discussions on the floor of the Oireachtas with respect to the recent amendments to Part V and he rightly pointed out that all of the public consultation submissions to the Government's new housing plan were received after the decision to take out Part V.  Now, to the great discomfort of the poor old folks in the freedom of information, FOI, section on housing, we are trying to find out who lobbied in the period between November-December 2020 and June 2021, when the decision was made.  Some of the information is in the lobbying register but not all of it.  It would be much easier if that information was volunteered and made public.  Such a move would make things fully transparent and say who was talked to.  There is no reason not to put that information in the public domain.  The measure would mean that we would not have to waste our time lodging FOI requests, the FOI unit in the Department would no longer receive pestering calls from Deputies Boyd Barrett, Cian O'Callaghan and I on a regular basis, and it would improve transparency.  Therefore, in the interests of transparency, I recommend amendment No. 40 as it stands or some revision of same.<\/p> <p>  Let me appeal to the better nature of the Minister of State.  Obviously. there are very large commercial interests in the sphere of offshore wind and we are going to need an awful lot of investment to provide the volume of wind that is required.  People will be concerned that some of that investment may not be in the public interest.  I presume, given the position adopted by the Minister of State, that he believes it is in the public interest, with which I have no quarrel at this point.  Therefore, assuaging public concern by publishing the information would be a valuable statement of intent.  <\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 41, I welcome the fact that it has been said that the policy statement will be subjected to strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment.  I always want to mention appropriate assessment, particularly in the absence of an adequate designation of Natura 2000 sites.  My one concern is that I have not seen anywhere where that is compelled.  The Minister of State may be promoted and elevated to a senior Ministry in another Department and somebody else may be in his position.  Can I hold that person to the same commitment that he has given to this committee?  There could also be a different government, different party, etc.  Would it not be better to make that very explicit in the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#Q02300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy repeat his questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#Q02400","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Yes.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin already made the point.  This is to save the suspicion that there are untoward things happening and to have information such as that relating to the people who have lobbied, who met with who, what representations were made available up front, and that we list those out as a matter of course in the context of policies or policy statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021101900002#R03100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1634598000,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Strictly speaking, the Minister of State's response is correct in that if we really want to make these changes, there is other legislation in which we should make them.

I would make an appeal to the him, however.  I really want to emphasise what it is we are trying to achieve and for the Minister of State to think about it and chat to his officials about it.  When this Bill is passed and we start going through the consents, the licensing and the planning applications, particularly for large offshore wind projects, none of us want this to happen in the context of any public perception that decisions are being made behind closed doors and outside of the formal public consultations.  It would be really helpful for those who want to see the maximum volume of foreshore wind energy to meet a renewable energy targets in an environmentally sustainable way.  I am not at all suggesting that the Minister of State, his officials or any of the planning authorities would do that.  This is about going that extra mile to demonstrate absolute transparency.  Sure, the Minister of State can say that this is really a matter for the Regulation of Lobbying Act but, notwithstanding that, I believe this is an opportunity for him to find a way to ensure that when these policy statements are being developed, we are going to let the public know about anybody who engages with us.<\/p><p>That means anybody, by the way.  It could be me, it could be Deputy Cian O'Callaghan or it could be the Chairman.  Given the volumes of public and private money that are eventually going to flow through the system, the maximum transparency possible would be very welcome.

My only fear with doing it in this <i>ad hoc<\/i>way is that, should there be further changes to the Regulation of Lobbying Act, this would sit as an outlier to that.  I am persuaded by the comments of the Minister of State that, if we believe in greater transparency and believe there needs to be a review, the place to do that is in the legislation which deals with how Ministers are lobbied, rather than inserting <i>ad hoc<\/i>amendments to different legislation.  For example, this committee recently dealt with the Land Development Agency Bill and I know we will deal with other Bills.

One is that the information is available if people go looking for it.  They can go looking on the lobbying register, which most people probably do not know how to do, or they can go looking via freedom of information, which is hassle for people.  They can find it and it is possible, but it is hassle.  However, if we make a decision on this critical issue of the development of our marine environment in terms of policy, policy statements, guidelines, consents and anything to do with that, it will be a matter of course that attached to those things will be a detailing of all representations that were made.  It is just there for people.  They do not have to go searching for it and they do not have to wait for some Government Department to come back to them or possibly strike out bits.  It is just there.  There is a difference.  I do not accept the Minister of State's response.  While I accept people can do what he says they can do, this is doing something different.  This is just making it readily and easily available, transparent and visible.<\/p> <p>  I do not see that it is a very difficult thing to do and, in fact, it is quite an easy thing to do.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, we will all be lobbying on various aspects of these things, so the Deputies who lobbied, the NGOs who lobbied and the corporate or commercial interests that lobbied are there for everybody to see.

It then means that when the lobbying legislation is being updated and reviewed, people could look at what we have done in this Bill and it could help to move it in the right direction.  Public confidence in what happens is very important, especially because, until now, the process around what happens has been developer-led.
