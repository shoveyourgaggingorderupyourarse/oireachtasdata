The fuel merchants I have spoken to employ people.  They pay PRSI and their taxes, including carbon tax and VAT.  They also enforce the smokeless fuel laws.  However, they cannot compete with the selling of smoky fuel from the North, mainly due to the continually rising carbon taxes.  The fuel merchants I have spoken to broadly welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal from next year and implement regulations designed to curb air pollution and its impact on public health.  The proposed legislation will see smoke emission rates for manufactured solid fuel coal and coal-based products reduced and permitted sulphur content also reduced over time.<\/p>  <p>  In order for these laws to be effective, the widespread selling of fuels mislabelled as low smoke has to be stopped.  In addition, the 100,000 tonnes of coal coming in from the North every year cannot be permitted to continue.  This coal has a retail value of approximately &euro;56 million per annum.  The main reason this is happening is that solid fuel in the North has a VAT rate of 5% compared with the 13.5% rate applied in the rest of Ireland.  Also in the North, carbon tax is 0% whereas at present in the South the carbon tax on 1 tonne of coal is &euro;87.  This is set to increase to &euro;107 per tonne next year and &euro;126 per tonne the year after that, with further annual increases until 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the current rate of carbon tax, the &euro;56 million worth of smuggled coal per annum represents a loss in VAT of more than &euro;7.5 million and a loss in carbon tax of &euro;8.7 million.  This is a total of more than &euro;16 million lost to the State.  It also represents a loss of almost &euro;40 million to the retailers.  Based on the carbon tax rate from 2021 to 2025, if this continues the State will incur a further loss of &euro;130 million and the loss to the retailers will be &euro;188 million.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is that there is little or no enforcement on the sale of fuel.  There is no checking of mislabelling of goods.  There are no efforts to curtail smuggling.  The proposed nationwide ban on smoky coal is being introduced to improve our air quality.  Without a dedicated task force to look at this issue and enforce the proper labelling of goods and the sale of smokeless fuel only, our air quality will not improve and, therefore, the health of our people will continue to be impacted negatively.  There needs to be more education for the consumer on the health and environmental impact of smoky coal.  There are also need to be fines for merchants caught trading in smoky coal and mislabelling products.<\/p>  <p>  What we have is a significant loss of revenue to the State in VAT and carbon taxes.  We have fuel retailers struggling to try to run legitimate businesses.  They pay their taxes, pay wages to employees and pay PRSI.  They are seeing their businesses going down the Swanee.  It means that reaching our carbon targets becomes more difficult.  It is contrary to the Government's objectives of the clean air strategy.  The findings of the Ricardo report, which estimates the cost of burning smoky coal at &euro;722 million, continue to apply.  There needs to be proper monitoring and enforcement of the rules on the sale of solid fuel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000003#A00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1634717520,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.<\/p><p>Solid fuel, that is, coal and peat, is liable to excise duty in the State in the form of the solid fuel carbon tax.  The solid fuel carbon tax is a national excise and applies at different rates to four categories of solid fuel, including coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat.  The solid fuel carbon tax rate is &euro;33.50 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted.<\/p><p>Liability to solid fuel carbon tax arises when solid fuel is first supplied in the State.  As solid fuels are not covered by the EU control and movement regime, there are no barriers or controls on solid fuels moving between member states and Northern Ireland.  The movement of solid fuel across the Border into the State from Northern Ireland does not generate a liability to solid fuel carbon tax, nor does the physical presence of solid fuel in the State.  It is not until solid fuel is first supplied within the State that solid fuel carbon tax becomes liable.<\/p><p>If solid fuel suppliers based in the State sources some or all of their solid fuel supplies from outside the State, they will be accountable for solid fuel carbon tax when they make first supplies in the State and must register with Revenue to account for and pay solid fuel carbon tax.  If suppliers based outside the State bring solid fuel into the State for supply direct to consumers, they must register with Revenue for the solid fuel carbon tax.  I am advised by Revenue that the majority of registered suppliers are importers or wholesalers and producers, and approximately 5% of those registered for solid fuel carbon tax are based in Northern Ireland.  It is important to note that where a private individual travels to Northern Ireland to purchase solid fuel for personal use, no solid fuel carbon tax is payable provided the private individual accompanies the fuel back into the State.<\/p><p>With regard to VAT, under the terms of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, transactions involving the movement of goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland in either direction continue to be treated as intra-Community transactions and are subject to EU VAT rules.  These rules apply only to business to business supplies of goods to or from Northern Ireland to taxable persons in Ireland and other EU member states.  The goods, including fuel products, are supplied at the zero rate of VAT and the taxable person in receipt of those goods self-accounts for VAT on a reverse-charge basis and, if applicable, takes a simultaneous VAT deduction in the next VAT return.  The onward distribution and sale of a fuel product to a consumer in the State is subject to the normal VAT rules and the Irish supplier is liable to account for VAT, currently the reduced rate of 13.5%, on the supply.  The consideration for a supply of goods or services is defined in EU VAT law and consists of everything which the supplier is entitled to receive in return for goods or services supplied, including taxes, duties, levies and charges and excluding the VAT.<\/p> <p>Therefore, VAT is chargeable on the solid fuel carbon tax element of fuel products.<\/p> <p> Where a business in Northern Ireland sells goods and arranges the transport of those goods to a consumer in Ireland, such sales of fuel products are referred to as intra-community distance sales.  Intra-community distance sales of fuel products from Northern Ireland to a consumer in a member state are subject to VAT in the member state of destination of the supply, which would be Ireland if the customer is based in the State.  In such cases, the supplier of those goods is required to register, subject to a threshold, in the State and to account for VAT on those supplies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000003#A00300","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634718120,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am not talking about somebody who gets into their car, drives across the Border and buys a few bags of coal.  Nobody is concerned about that.  That cross-Border trade has happened over the years.  We are talking about advertisements, mainly on social media, inviting people to ring a number, pay online and get even tonnes of fuel delivered to their door on a pallet.  No carbon tax or VAT is paid on this.  The prices being charged indicate it could not be because they greatly undercut those the merchants here have to charge in order to pay carbon tax and VAT.<\/p>  <p>  This has been going on for years and will only get worse as the price of fuel rises due to the increase in carbon tax.  Something has to be done.  We are fooling ourselves if we think we are helping the environment by ignoring this.  Would it not be possible to give the Revenue Commissioners additional powers and resources to track and trace all solid fuel supplied on the Irish market?  Some of that which is coming in is not what it is advertised to be and it needs to be checked.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest also providing a dedicated freephone number to allow customers and retailers to report suspected carbon tax and VAT evasion.  Fuel merchants frequently do not know who they are supposed to report this issue to and are passed from pillar to post as to whose responsibility it is, and nothing is done about it.  There has to be an increase in the penalties associated with non-payment of solid fuel carbon tax.  Moreover, there should be incentives to encourage customers to switch from using carbon-intensive solid fuel to low-carbon, low-smoke solid fuel.<\/p>  <p>  It is the poorest people in society who pay carbon tax because they cannot afford to bulk-buy fuel and have it delivered across the Border.

I apologise that I have to raise this issue but I am disappointed with what is going on at the Department.  I will outline the history of the school in question, about which the Minister and I had a Zoom meeting a few months ago.  It is Holy Trinity school which has been there for 230 years.  It is under the patronage of Church of Ireland and if it was anything but a Church of Ireland school, this would not be going on.  The site in Altamount Street, Westport, was formerly owned by the Sisters of Mercy and was selected for this new school.  It was the wish of the Sisters of Mercy that this school would be used by Holy Trinity.  The school is currently located on Newport Road but this site is not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  The school is a credit to the community.  Four or five of the Mayo GAA panel are former pupils, yet there are very few sporting facilities.  After the school had been provided by the Sisters of Mercy, there was a row as to who would take over the site.  I was involved in that.  Neither the county council nor the Department of Education would take it over, but eventually, the Department took it over because there were problems with not doing so.  We were delighted when we heard that had finally happened.<\/p>  <p>  All of a sudden, the co-educational school appeared and, for whatever reason, the Department, which had a site for the school in the town of Westport, tried to build it in the middle of a housing estate, in an old social welfare office, which was never going to happen.  Then, out of nowhere, the Department decided it would put the two schools together on a site that is capable of having only one school.  I hope that in respect of Mayo County Council and the planning office, it will not again be the case that there is one rule for the general public and another for the State.  The State should obey the law as the general public does.  This site is not capable of housing two schools.<\/p>  <p>  The Holy Trinity school was included in the schools programme.  When the previous Minister, Deputy McHugh, was in office, he texted me to say the school was going ahead, that the co-educational school would not be with it and that the Holy Trinity school was about to begin construction.  I have a copy of the text message on my phone.  To be fair to Holy Trinity, the management, the principal, the teachers and the 230 pupils, the time has come for the school to be built.  We have the site and the school is in the programme.  The site is going into dereliction and is affecting the town of Westport, which is very proud of its tradition with Tidy Towns and very little dereliction.  Across from the site, a new library is to be built.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the Minister inherited this problem but she might address my questions.  When will Holy Trinity get its school?  Who made the decision to have the co-educational school co-located with the Holy Trinity school, given that it was never in the game in the first instance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000004#B00500","speaker":"1500"},{"type":"speech","time":1634718120,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which has been raised consistently with me by Deputy Calleary and Senator Chambers.  As Deputy Ring outlined, I met a deputation from the school and was happy to do so.  Nevertheless, this Topical Issue matter gives me an opportunity to set out for the House the position with regard to Holy Trinity National School.<\/p>  <p>  Holy Trinity is a co-educational primary school under Church of Ireland patronage.  The school had an enrolment of 63 pupils in the 2020-21 school year and a staffing of one principal, two mainstream class teachers and one special education teaching post.  It is currently situated on a patron-owned site in a permanent building in the heart of Westport, comprising three classrooms and ancillary accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has a largescale and ambitious plan for the roll-out of school building projects under the national development plan, NDP, and as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The continuation of construction work on school building projects during the lockdown period in early 2021 was an important enabler in facilitating the delivery of our school building programme.  Significant increased funding is provided to the school sector capital investment programme under the NDP.  My Department&rsquo;s focus for capital investment in recent years has been the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and this is expected to continue to be a driver of capital investment in the short to medium term.<\/p> <p>During the NDP period from 2018 to 2020, 526 building projects were completed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme.  These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places, including permanent accommodation for 229 special classes, and additional capacity for 67 classrooms in 14 special schools throughout the country.  The Department has a significant existing pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity needs.  This is managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme.  This will make significant progress in providing modern energy-efficient school facilities and the replacement of temporary accommodation.<\/p> <p> A building project to construct a new school building for Holy Trinity National School is included in the Department&rsquo;s large-scale capital programme.  It is the Department&rsquo;s intention, subject to securing the usual statutory consents, that the school will be relocated to a Minister-owned site at Altamont Street, Westport.  In line with the public spending code, to maximise the use of State assets consideration must be given to the potential to master-plan the Altamont Street site to accommodate a second primary school.  This proposal has required engagement with the local authority and my Department is now in the process of finalising its assessment of this potential solution.  This assessment is also incorporating current projections of future school place requirements, which were recently updated.<\/p> <p> These projections of future school place demand are modelled using data from a range of sources, including school enrolments, attendance patterns and information on current and planned residential development activity.  The Department also works closely with the National Council for Special Education in anticipating requirements for special education needs provision.  Once the full assessment process is complete, my Department will be in further contact with the patron bodies of the schools in question, including Holy Trinity National School.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I assure him that my Department is concerned, at all times, with ensuring the accommodation needs of schools in Westport are appropriately advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000004#B00600","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634718720,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.  I will not get into a row with her today but natural justice should apply here.  This school was involved first.  I know a previous Minister - not the current Minister - had more interest in co-education schools than the other schools.  We have great schools in Westport and the only school that needs to be relocated is Holy Trinity National School.  The co-education group has come in since and it seems to be getting priority now.  The Holy Trinity school has lobbied and raised funding while working in difficult conditions, and it is not being treated right by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I have nothing against co-education.  In fact, I hope a site is obtained for the co-education school.  There are plenty of derelict sites in Westport that could be used for it but I do not see why it should be located on the Holy Trinity school site.  I was very much involved in this process.  If the Minister knew the trouble her Department and Mayo County Council have caused because neither of them wanted to take over the site.  We had to get the Minister at the time and the county council to sit down together and reach an agreement on who would take over the site.  The site was always for Holy Trinity National School.  The co-education school was not in the picture in regard to that site.  The Department brought it into the picture.  That decision was taken by a previous Minister.  As usual, the real government are the officials who will not put their names on the ballot paper.  It is the Minister and I who represent the Holy Trinity National School and the people of Westport and Kerry.  We are, therefore, the people who should be making the decisions.

This has generated poor publicity.  The principal, Vicky Barron, and the board of management have the full support of the children and families whose health and safety they have prioritised.  It is incumbent on the Department to address the fact that the HSE has not been forthcoming with the support required to prevent this action being taken.  There are questions to be answered, primarily for the parents, teachers and the principal.  Who is in charge?  Who is responsible for a situation like this?<\/p><p>I will move on.  The issue I raise today relates to the Christian Brothers post-primary school in New Ross, which wrote to the Department in 2017 requesting that the physical education, PE, needs of the children be addressed.  There are more than 403 pupils in the school and they have no PE hall.  Since 2017, the principal, Pat Rossiter, has received just two responses from the Department.  The first was on 12 December 2017 from the then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, stating that the application had been received.  On 9 February 2018, a letter was received from the then Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, acknowledging that the sports hall application had been received.<\/p><p>I have been involved in this matter since my election 18 or 20 months ago and I have received the same reply to my correspondence several times.

Enhanced and modernised PE facilities will also provide important amenities for local communities. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is brilliant but I hope it will be delivered.  When will the Minister provide funding for a PE classroom or hall for the CBS Secondary School, New Ross, to ensure the school can provide its students with the learning facilities required to support PE as a leaving certificate subject?

All the operations within our schools, from their reopening and the measures we put in place at that time, have been under the direction of public health authorities, and those authorities continue to make judgments on the operation of our schools where there may be a Covid-19 incident.  It was a request of school management and leaders that no individual school would have that burden of responsibility placed upon it.  We are required to follow public health advice as it is issued.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which has also been raised with me on a consistent basis by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne.  Today gives me an opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education's plans for upgrading school buildings, including the Christian Brothers Secondary School, New Ross.  The Deputy may be aware that CBS New Ross is a Catholic, co-educational post-primary school in New Ross with an enrolment in 2020 of 397 pupils.  This represents an increase of 24% in the past five years.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department approved capital funding for CBS New Ross in 2019 for the provision of four general classrooms, including one general classroom prefab replacement, one special education teaching room, one design and communication graphics room and one home economics room.  This project was devolved to the school authorities for delivery and they were approved to go to planning in July 2021, which I was pleased to see.  My Department's planning and building unit also received an application in June 2017 from CBS New Ross seeking capital funding for the provision of a physical education, PE, hall.  The school authority was informed in writing that it is currently not possible to consider this application.<\/p> <p> Under the national development plan, increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme, which is an extremely positive and proactive step.  This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in post-primary schools.  During the national development plan period for 2018 to 2020, there were 526 completed building projects under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme.  These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places, including permanent accommodation for 229 special classes and additional capacity for 67 classrooms in 14 special schools throughout the country.<\/p> <p> The Department also has a significant existing pipeline of projects to be delivered over the coming years to meet capacity needs, managed under the large-scale capital programme and the additional school accommodation scheme.  This will make significant progress in providing modern, energy-efficient school facilities and the replacement of temporary accommodation.<\/p> <p> The immediate priority of my Department is providing 20,000 new and replacement school places each year to ensure every child has a school place.  However, later in the national development plan period there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.

I was there for the delivery in 2019 of the grant of funding for the new build.<\/p><p>The enrolment of 397 students has increased to a current total of 403 students, although the school lost two students because of the lack of PE facilities.  The fact remains that we have 403 students and need to cater for their physical education requirements.

In a time when we live in such mental health strife, and particularly with what students have been through in the past number of years because of Covid-19 and other factors, we must prioritise a build for the school.  There are 403 students with a basic tarmac yard where they must carry out physical education exercises, and most of the time that is impossible because of the weather, particularly at this time of year.<\/p><p>The principal has stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCBS New Ross is the only secondary school in the county without a sports arena.  Presently, PE is delivered outside on a non-suitable tarmac yard.  Winter PE is regularly not an option for the students presently for 403 students.  This is a major issue.

As Deputy Lahart has outlined so well, of course someone presenting to an emergency department is anxious and upset.  The presence of Covid has made it more fraught.  I acknowledge the distress that overcrowded emergency departments cause to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  I acknowledge the work and commitment of staff in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of emergency care throughout the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE reports that emergency department attendances have now reached 2019 levels, exceeding such levels at some sites.  The numbers of patients waiting on trolleys have been increasing steadily since June 2021, although trolley counts for October to date remain 28% lower than the 2019 levels.<\/p>  <p>  Tallaght University Hospital is one of Ireland's largest acute teaching hospitals and the emergency department is one of the busiest in the country with 35,000 attendances to the end of August this year, an increase of 8.6% compared with the same period last year.  Emergency department admissions were 9,900, up by 7.1% compared with the same period in 2020 and up by 7.6% compared with 2019.  Sustained high volumes of attendances, including many frail elderly patients with complex medical conditions, have continued over several weeks now.  The hospital is actively managing the situation by having early ward rounds and identifying patients for expedited discharge.<\/p>  <p>  While attendance and admission numbers have now returned to pre-pandemic levels, the continued requirement to provide separate Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 pathways presents an additional challenge to patient flow in all hospitals, including Tallaght.<\/p>  <p>  The winter plan for 2020-21 and budget 2021 provided for an additional 1,146 permanent hospital beds, of which 56 are in Tallaght.  I am pleased to say that 50 of these new beds have been opened, with the remaining six acute beds to open in the near future.  The 50 beds comprise 26 beds opened since January 2021 in the new day-care unit at Tallaght Cross West, a further 18 beds also opened since January in Tallaght Cross and most recently, six trauma beds opened in September.  These new beds provide improved patient experience in terms of comfort and dignity.  They improve infection prevention and control capabilities and will improve patient flow at the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, the hospital has been pursuing an ambitious capital development programme.  Last year saw the culmination of three major projects, namely, the Reeves day surgery centre, the Vartry renal unit and the community radiology centre.  Despite the challenges that 2020 presented, all units scheduled to open during the year opened on time and on budget, which is great testament to Tallaght hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Construction work has been under way since October 2020 to deliver the expansion and upgrade of the intensive care unit at Tallaght.  When both phases are completed, an additional 12 single ICU rooms will be available.  Both phases are expected to be completed in quarter 2 of 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000007#E00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1634719920,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and I had a sneak preview of the children's satellite hospital at Tallaght.

It is a very worrying trend so early in the winter.  We are facing into the possibility of the winter flu and the vomiting bug.  Luckily last year people did not present with those two conditions but already we are seeing the trends.  Coupled with that, we are all conscious that more than 400 people presenting with Covid are in hospitals, including more than 70 in ICU.  That also needs to be thrown into the mix and it has been very difficult.  I join the Deputy and everybody the House in saluting front-line workers, dealing with this at the coalface.<\/p>  <p>  To date under the winter plan, approximately 800 additional acute beds have been provided nationally on a permanent basis over the number available at the end of 2019.  A total of 73 permanent sub-acute beds have been provided.

The charter states that people with autism should share the same rights as enjoyed by all EU citizens and that these rights should be enforced by legislation.  This has not yet happened in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to provide for the development and implementation of a cross-Department and multi-agency strategy to provide and implement services for autistic people.  Understanding the autism spectrum is crucial to the success of this Bill and any strategy that follows.  Service provision for people with autism should not be discretionary; it should be a right that is protected in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  For the State to do nothing would cost more in the long run.  For example, inaccessibility to regular supports has contributed to the occurrence of regression of autistic children's interpersonal and educational skills during the pandemic.  Financial pressure is acutely felt by families who have assumed full-time caring roles for their autistic children.  They report that existing social welfare payments are insufficient to cover the costs of therapy and additional support.  A recent study by the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, found that the average annual cost per child amounted to more than &euro;28,000, and related to private services, lost income, and informal care. <\/p>  <p>  Along with my Regional Group I look forward to working with all Oireachtas parties and stakeholders to ensure that this legislation is fit for purpose and is successful.  It will be a game changer for people with autism and it will enshrine their rights in law.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Government has tabled an amendment, which we have carefully considered.  We do not want to kick this Bill down the road for 12 months for the sake of doing that.  I understand that the Minister is setting up an Oireachtas committee.  I want a commitment that this will happen sooner rather than later and that the life of the committee will be fairly short and we get on with the work that needs to be done.  We are also looking for a commitment that the autism strategy, which is being developed, will be enshrined in legislation and incorporated into the legislation in order that it has the backing of the State from a legislative point of view.  If we do not do this, and if we just create a strategy, we will find that the strategies are what they are, which is sheets of paper without actually having the effectiveness to run it through for improvements for families, and for children and adults with autism.  We need to understand the complexities of autism and why the legislation is required.  Since 1996 the State has failed to introduce the legislation.  This is a damning indictment on the political body that we are.  It is time we changed that.<\/p>  <p>  My motivation, and the motivation of the Regional Group, is to get the legislation put in place with the co-operation and consensus of all parties within the House.  This is not a political issue.  This is a human rights issue.  It is important that we understand it as a human right.  I acknowledge that some work has been done and that there are commitments within the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for being here this morning.  The importance of this legislation and what it will do for people with autism, will be transformative.  For us as legislators it will mean that we have done some service for them.  I also acknowledge the work of former Senator and former Minister for Health, Dr. James Reilly, who first introduced this Bill in 2017.  I remind Members that this Bill passed all stages in the Seanad.  The only reason it did not come into the D&aacute;il at the time was because the D&aacute;il fell and so the Bill also fell as it was set aside.  It is important that we take it back on.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I put it to the Minister and the Minister of State that autism is not a health issue.  Autism is a human rights issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000008#F00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1634720520,"counter":34,"content":"<p>One in 65 people in Ireland is on the autism spectrum.  This figure includes men, women and children and each one of them is deserving of their rights as Irish citizens.  Each one of us has a moral and a civil duty to ensure that they get them.  If autism is not part of our lives we will most certainly have heard of it.  We will most certainly know a person or a family dealing with autism.  Many people do not understand the barriers faced by people with autism.<\/p><p>The dictionary definition of autism is a lifelong non-progressive, neurological condition.  Just like our perception of autism, the dictionary falls way short of accurately defining autism.  This is because autism is impossible to define.  It is not possible to sum up autism in one sentence.  We know that there is not just one form of autism, there are many sub-types and most are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  Because autism is such a wide and varied condition, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges.  The ways in which people on the spectrum learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled to severely challenged.  Some people with autism may require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support.  In some cases, people on the autism spectrum live entirely independently.  The most accurate description for autism that I have read comes from Dr. Stephen Shore, an autistic professor of special education.  He describes in very basic terms how, &quot;If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism.&quot;  Unlike most other defined conditions the term autism is not one-size-fits-all.<\/p><p>In 2017, the former Minister for Health, Dr. James Reilly, recognised the unique and diverse needs of autistic people and he introduced the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill to the Seanad.  It received unanimous support but, unfortunately, circumstances prevented the Bill from reaching the D&aacute;il.  The Regional Group, of which I am a member, has now revived this Bill.  We are united in our determination that legislation will be passed for and on behalf of the people with autism and their families.  We are committed to advocating on behalf of those who do not have the platform to advocate for themselves.<\/p><p>Many people associate autism with children or young people but there are large numbers of adults with autism who face a daily challenge to fit into everyday life.  The true number of adults on the autism spectrum is unknown.  Many have simply fallen through the cracks and have never been diagnosed.  Obtaining a formal diagnosis in an adult is a minefield of obstacles and many are assessed as having mental health issues and never actually receive a correct diagnosis.  Alternatively, those who can have to turn to the private system for accurate analysis and assessment.  The educational system offers some support to children and young people with autism.  Autistic adults in the workplace do not have same comfort.  This lack of support weighs heavily on adults with autism, who are particularly vulnerable to unemployment, exploitation, and falling into poverty.  This contributes to the fact that eight out of ten such adults will develop a mental health problem.  Finding employment can be a challenge for autistic adults and holding onto a job can be even more so.  As many as 80% of those on the autistic spectrum are either underemployed or do not have a job.  According to a study conducted by AsIAm and <i>Irishjobs.ie<\/i>, as many as 77% of autistic people surveyed believed that they would face barriers getting the job they wanted or in starting their own business.<\/p><p>The pandemic has been particularly difficult time for people with autism.  The lack of normal routines and structures added to ongoing pandemic uncertainty and this proved very difficult for autistic people to cope with.  On the other hand, there was blessed relief from social stress.  Welcome changes noted by adults with autism were the increase in solidarity with all people, and the reduced sensory and social overload.<\/p> <p>While this was being experienced by everyone, it gave autistic people a rare feeling of equality.  None of us lives in an ideal world.  We can all help to make the world better for others.  For those on the autism spectrum we can grant them rights, namely, the right to proper services and supports to enable them to live their lives to the best, the right to be fully accepted as citizens and the right to a social and inclusive life.  We need a national autistic strategy that properly meets the needs of one in every 65 people.  This time it must be delivered by enacting this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000008#F00300","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634721120,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a consistency in the type and availability of autism services that exist across the country.  Although the Bill was first introduced in 2017, many of the problems that it sought to address still remain issues today.  This highlights the need for legislative intervention.  For those familiar with autism, they will know that it contains many different forms.  That means each person has a different level of need.<\/p><p>The cross-departmental engagement, as mentioned, is a way forward in the development of an autism strategy and should be welcomed.  The fact that the Minister for Health has to consult with each Department in the development of a strategy should be very welcome.  Too often we see lack of joined-up thinking in Government circles with different arms of the State engaged in a wrestling match with each other.  A cross-departmental approach, therefore, is welcomed and would have my full support. <\/p><p>Section 2 provides for a clear system of accountability with regard to service provisions for people with autism.  There are probably many other sections of Government activity that could do with clear systems of accountability but this one would be certainly welcome.<\/p><p>To quote from the Bill's explanatory memorandum:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSection 3(1)(a) requires that the Strategy outline how the needs of persons with autism spectrum disorder should be met by service providers in respect of access to various specified services.  Section 3(1)(b) requires that the Strategy should make provision for individual assessments of persons with autism spectrum disorder to [be] conducted by a team of medical professionals.  Section 3(1)(c) requires that the Strategy place an emphasis on how families of a person having autism spectrum disorder can be supported in meeting the needs of that person. <\/blockquote>  <p>With all of those fine proposals and aspirations, I say to the Government that I do not and will not support a situation where services provided to people with autism are different depending on whereabouts in the country the person is located.  Private services are costing families very significant amounts of money and in many cases are unaffordable.  People with autism in counties Wexford and Donegal should not and must not have different access and availability of local services.  <\/p><p>In County Wexford there is no respite service available for autism families.  I have a situation where a family has fostered a child with autism for the past ten years.  The child is now ten years of age and must go to Enniskerry, County Wicklow for the first time in ten years for respite.  I know that that is not acceptable.  I know also that the Minister of State is working very hard on this and I appreciate that both Ministers are but that is an unacceptable situation.  Funding is now more available and that is one issue I ask the Ministers present to categorically address.  The issue for this child is that it has never been away from its family for ten years and now has to travel in excess of approximately an hour and 45 minutes.  If there was an issue for the child and the family had to be called upon in that hour and 45 minutes, very significant damage and upset can be done.  I ask that the Ministers to bear that in mind and I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000009#G00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1634721120,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here this morning to speak on this Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill which is very important for a number of reasons, and two in particular.  First, it allows us to shine a light on another neglected area in Irish society.  Second and perhaps most importantly, it allows us to speak for people who cannot be here this morning.  These are the people who are profoundly autistic, non-verbal and cannot articulate for themselves what they might like to say but we speak also for the carers and families who would probably love to be here in the Gallery but because they never get a day off, they never get the opportunity to represent themselves.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that we do justice to both of those groups of people this morning but no words of ours could be adequate to convey the sense of frustration that they are feeling at the lack of services or could convey the importance that they place on this Bill.  This is a very important message to get across.<\/p>  <p>  I have three points to make in the time allowed.  I will focus primarily on the people with autism, in the first instance and I will then touch on the carers and the families.  Finally, I will wrap up with what the Government could do to ameliorate the situation and make things a little bit more bearable from that point of view.<\/p>  <p>  As to the people with autism, I do not need to tell the Minister of State as she is well aware that early intervention is key.  Early assessment, diagnosis and intervention are absolutely essential to developing the personal skills and educational access.  I know that this takes resources but one is better off paying small money early rather than big money later down the tracks.  The second point I wish to raise is that the stigma is still there with autism and I am reassured that there are provisions in the Bill to address the stigma issue, which is another reason I will be supporting it.   Third, it is not just access to healthcare that is the problem but access to education and employment as well.  These are the three big issues from the perspective of people with autism.<\/p>  <p>  For the families and carers, burnout is a very significant issue.  As my colleague, Deputy Verona Murphy, pointed out, respite is a major deficiency across country, not just in one constituency but nationwide and people are completely burned out from that perspective.  It is not just physical and mental burnout but there is also cash burnout.  The NUIG research is very clear that it costs approximately &euro;500 a week to look after an autistic child, per child, when one takes into consideration the loss of earnings and the additional services that they have to provide privately.<\/p>  <p>  Other parents who are dealing with autistic children have come to us to say that their worry and concern is that on their death, who will look after the children thereafter?  There is an issue in respect of access to employment, healthcare and education.  As for the meagre services that are provided up to the age of 18, even those meagre services almost disappear from that age and thereafter.  Provision of supports, therefore, for adults who have autism also needs to be improved.<\/p>  <p>  As a final point, how can the Government improve things?  I agree with Deputy Canney that the establishment of a special committee on autism will certainly be a help but supporting this Bill will be a big step forward for a number of reasons.  First, the Bill emphasises a rights-based approach rather than a discretionary approach.  I know that there are implications for resources in that regard but a rights-based approach is definitely a good way to go.  Second and quite importantly, all this is asking for is to establish an interdepartmental, multi-agency committee to look at setting up an autism strategy.  We have looked at this Bill forensically over the past number of weeks and the first thing that jumped out at me was the fact that there is currently not an autism strategy.  It is incredible that in 2021, we still do not have a strategy.  Establishing a strategy is very important because there is no surer way of not achieving one&rsquo;s objectives than not actually having them in the first place.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill is also reasonable because it sets out a two-year timeframe, which is quite respectable and lays out a number of helpful points that would be very useful when it comes to setting the terms of reference of that committee.  There is also a nod towards cost.  The Members in the Regional Group are rational people and we realise there are finite resources but there is a very explicit statement in the Bill that costings can be incremental.  This recognises that there will not be an immediate explosion of resources but it can be done over time.  <\/p>  <p>  I also like that there is an emphasis on a public awareness campaign and for training for people who interact with autistic people in order to know how to exactly make things better from their perspective.<\/p>  <p>  To sum up, Dr. James Reilly, who I have never met, has done his bit in getting the Bill this far, as has the Seanad.

I welcome the opportunity to participate in today's debate on issues of support for persons with autism and their families.  It is not the first time that I have debated autism in the House.  In the previous Government we also had many debates on this issue.<\/p><p>Having previously met autism groups, organisations, families and people with autism, I note at the outset that I know that language is important.<\/p> <p>I have met people who prefer to say \"a person with autism\" while others have told me they identify as an autistic person.  I will use both terms during my remarks to try to be inclusive of this difference.  Providing adequate support to persons with autism and responding to the challenges and barriers they face is a personal priority of mine and, I know, of many colleagues participating in this debate.  This Bill has been resurrected since 2017.  I absolutely welcome the fact that Deputy Canney and his group have shone a light on this.  I would love to have seen the Bill go through during the term of the last D&aacute;il, when there was real support and appetite for it. <\/p> <p> The development of a national autism strategy is a firm commitment in the programme for Government.  Earlier this year, at AslAm&rsquo;s online event to mark World Autism Day, I announced my intention to establish a working group to develop an autism innovation strategy with the aim of launching it in early 2022.  In budget 2022, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and I secured &euro;100,000 for the design of an autism innovation strategy and for raising awareness around it.  I thank the Minister.  While I am not fully transferred into his Department as of yet, I welcome his work and co-operation within the Department in ensuring that I had funding for this strategy, to which I committed in 2021, in order that it could start working in full in 2022.  The working group to develop, implement and monitor the autism innovation strategy will be established before the end of the year and I will personally chair that group.  In addition to the participation of representatives from Departments and agencies to ensure that we take a whole-of-government approach, a public and open call inviting expressions of interest to participate in this group will be announced shortly.<\/p> <p> Engagement and consultation with autistic people is key and they will be very much part of the strategy's development.  It cannot just be neurotypicals drafting the strategy.  In line with our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, it is critical that the strategy be co-designed by, and informed by the lived experiences of people with autism, their families and their representatives.  The aim of the working group will be to identity innovations that can be achieved over the course of 12 to 18 months and which can make a real impact in reducing the challenges autistic people face and to implement measures to make Ireland a more autism-friendly country.  There are four pillars within that, namely, health, housing, education and employment.  Each of the Deputies opposite me raised those issues in their contributions.  While ambitious, these targets will focus on delivering tangible solutions to the challenges, needs and experiences of people with autism in specific areas.  I have already outlined those key pillars.  It also will be important for the strategy to investigate goals that could have benefits for the wider neurodiverse population.  This will be the basic framework of the strategy and I look forward to chairing the working group as we collectively identify the areas to focus on. <\/p> <p> I note that Senator Carrigy is calling for the establishment of a dedicated Oireachtas committee to create a space for regular conversation on the lived experience of people with autism, which I think is a worthwhile suggestion.  I note that Deputy Canney is also requesting this.  I am fully supportive of the creation of such a committee.<\/p> <p> Our commitment to responding to issues faced by autistic people is clear and firm.  As I have outlined, we are progressing plans to develop an ambitious, agile and dynamic strategy which will have as its immediate focus the need for real and tangible solutions to the challenges, needs and experiences of people with autism.  We can achieve more timely action and results through and agile, flexible and responsive policy and action approach - which I believe is what Deputy Berry was speaking about - such as can be seen in the proposed autism innovation strategy than we could through a static approach characterised by the rigidity of primary legislation.  It is for this reason that the Government does not oppose the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017 but instead proposes a timed amendment to delay Second Stage consideration by one year in order to let the autism innovation strategy take shape and begin its work.  That will give Deputy Canney and the Regional Group a period of time to judge my actions and the actions of the Government in respect of what I have said about the autism innovation strategy under those four pillars.  <\/p> <p> There is low-hanging fruit that has been ignored for many years by various Departments.  They have not really engaged with the needs of people with autism and their families, which are most precious, but have kept the door closed.  I want to push that door open in respect of housing, education, health and employment.  The Ministers who are in place and the Department will support me and allow me to show where is that low-hanging fruit, which our constituents regularly tell us about.  Delaying Second Stage by 12 months will give Deputy Canney&rsquo;s group an opportunity to judge our actions.<\/p> <p> At present, we have two national policy frameworks that address and respond to issues that affect all persons with disabilities including those with autism. These strategies are the national disability inclusion strategy, the steering group of which I chair, and the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities.  These strategies, by design, are monitored and implemented in tandem with robust stakeholder engagement, these stakeholders including persons with disability and disabled persons organisations.  The autism innovation strategy will complement and reinforce both of these national strategies and, crucially, will also align with the development and implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities implementation plan.  <\/p> <p> In any proposed legislative programme, we need to recognise potential knock-on consequences.  Our approach to date, under the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 and the Equal Status Acts, has been to respond to disabilities in a holistic manner.  These Acts look at the common challenges faced by persons with disabilities and allow space for specific and bespoke challenges and barriers to be identified and addressed at a policy level.  This has provided the right balance to date.  If an autism strategy were introduced by statute, this House would run a serious risk of being seen to create a hierarchy of disabilities in which some are deserving of specific statutory supports and recognition and some are not.  That sends a dangerous and disheartening message to persons with disabilities at a time when we are working under the UNCRPD framework to build the self-advocacy capacity of persons with disabilities and to realise universal rights under the UNCRPD. <\/p> <p> A further unintended consequence could be created whereby legislative supports for certain types of disabilities or impairments result in priority being given, in a resourcing or budgetary context, to some disability supports that have specific legislative support over others that do not. <\/p> <p> I gave real thought to the Bill introduced by former Senator, Dr. James Reilly.  There is no denying that.  I tried to find workarounds to allow me to step along the legislative process.  That is where the autism innovation strategy came from.  I knew I would receive similar pushback to that which the then Senator received, which is why I have come forward the autism strategy.  It will allow me to work with various Departments, to pick the low-hanging fruit, to gain the inclusive support of all Members of the Oireachtas and, most importantly, to demonstrate to the families that we actually are listening and that we can deliver.  That is where I am coming from with the delivery of the autism innovation strategy.  I now have funding behind me to support my programme of works over the coming months.  I plan to work very hard on this.<\/p> <p> Plans to develop and implement the autism innovation strategy are already under way and it is for this reason, to give these plans time to work and to ensure that we continue to legislate for persons with disabilities in an equal and holistic manner, that the Government will not oppose the Private Member's Bill today but will instead propose a timed amendment to reconsider the Second Stage of the Bill in October 2022, when the initial working of the innovation strategy can be considered.  The Deputies can then judge me on my actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000009#G00400","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634722320,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I think I am taking five minutes.

I thank our colleagues in the Regional Group for bringing forward this motion.  It is great when we have the opportunity to discuss all the issues around autism.  In 2019, as some people may be aware if they were in the House at that time, we brought forward a motion on an autism strategy that got unanimous support.  It included the setting up of a committee, so there could be consultation with various relevant groups within the sector.  That is very important and cannot be underestimated because when you start talking to people about their lived experiences and those of their families, in addition to the advocacy groups, you learn so much from that.  So many parents have to battle.  The point was well made that it is not just about children, but as Sinn F&eacute;in children's spokesperson I tend to focus my comments on areas affecting them.<\/p>  <p>  We all know so many stories of people who have issues at the assessment stage.  I accept and acknowledge, as I have previously, that there have been improvements in certain areas in the assessment process, but there are still issues around access to therapies when people get their assessments, such as occupational therapy, physical therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy.  It depends and every person is different.  Some children might need all three therapies, some need one and some need more support than others.  It is very important that we start addressing these issues and start putting the resources in place so that children can see an occupational therapist without a major delay.  <\/p>  <p>  We all know, and it is said time and again, about early intervention.  I will briefly mention Dr. Niall Muldoon's report.  The Minister of State was before the children's committee regarding that report.  Dr. Muldoon drew into stark contrast the situation people with autism are living with.  Sometimes people get through one battle, which is the diagnosis, but there is then a battle for therapies and then one about school and whether they can get a class.  We need also need to talk a little about language.  I do not think we should refer to autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units.  People do not necessarily mean any harm by that, but they are ASD classes.  Some advocacy groups state autism should be referred to as autism spectrum condition, ASC, not disorder.  We need to start looking at the language we use to ensure it is correct.  Once a child gets into school, potentially, is there school transport?  There are just so many battles.  I will also raise the issue of the lack of preschool places for anybody with an ASC condition.  For example, in Kilkenny, there is one preschool and that is it.  It is fantastic if a child can get into it, but what if he or she cannot?  It makes a massive difference to somebody starting school if that child is in an ASC class or might have the resources of a special needs assistant.  <\/p>  <p>  I was supportive of the strategy when the Minister of State announced it.  The consultation element was part of the reason I was so supportive of it because, in general, there is a serious lack of consultation in all Departments and in this Chamber.  It is important we have that, but time is ticking.  When I raised this issue in 2019 it had already been raised by several Deputies and parties and we had several motions.  Here we are in 2021 and I heard the Minister of State talk about another year.  Children cannot wait if they are starting school, are already in school or are coming to the end of primary school.  I know a number of parents whose children are in primary school and who then start panicking about secondary school because the supports are even less there than in primary school, if parents even get supports there.  There is also the situation of what the diagnosis states because it has to specifically state certain things in order to get supports.  Parents panic about the junior certificate, the leaving certificate and what supports will be there for their children.<\/p>  <p>  We need to stop all the chaos around this issue and start putting the resources into it.  In fairness, the Minister of State is well intentioned.  She always engages in these debates and with the committee, but we need to see the resources.  I hope these debates are helpful because I know the autism strategy has not been fully transferred into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth yet.  Whoever is holding the purse strings needs to realise they need to invest and they need to ensure therapies, preschool places, classes and transport to school can be accessed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000011#J00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722320,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion that has been brought forward.  It is very important we have an overarching autism strategy that brings all the different services and supports under the one umbrella to ensure that children and adults get the supports they need.  I know the Minister of State is very much aware of this, but I question how many times we have to bring forward motions, Bills and discussions before we see this kind of overarching strategy that we all agree needs to happen.  My colleague, Deputy Funchion, brought forward the autism strategy, which had cross-party support but, unfortunately, we are here again today without it being pushed forward.  Deputy Funchion also brought forward previously the need for a committee that ensures such a strategy is delivered upon and holds people to account to ensure they fulfil their responsibilities in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  We have all heard of the distress of families who say that time and again their family members simply do not receive the support they need and deserve.  I might speak to the Minister of State about one issue that has been raised with me recently by a particular constituent about a new children's disability network team that is supposed to be based in the Renmore area, who was told it would be in place by July this year.  I contacted the HSE regarding it and I was told that, at this time, it was not possible to provide an estimated wait time and the children's disability network team would be in contact with the family in due course.  This particular family has not heard from it since.  This has been going on since July so they are very concerned.  I have followed up with the HSE since then but there has been no further update.  This particular child is waiting for these services since he or she was 11 years old and was referred for services in 2016.  That is nearly half this child's lifetime that he or she has been waiting for support.  It is important we make plans to provide services, but what people really need is follow-through and that these services are made accessible to those who need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000011#J00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722320,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her interest in this area.  Last Friday, I met a women in north Kerry.  Her son is four years old and has a rare chromosome deficiency, Kleefstra syndrome, which causes him to have difficulties communicating.  I met him too and he has problems with his gait and needs early intervention now.  He is not getting services.  Time and again, over the past few weeks in particular, I have met parents who can afford to pay &euro;150 per week for the necessary interventions but, unfortunately, and the enraging part about it is, this woman and her child are awaiting ear, nose and throat, ENT, appointments, paediatric services and cardiology appointments for up to two years.  He rarely sees occupational therapists and speech therapists, he needs housing adaptation and he sees Kerry Intervention and Disability Services in Listowel for approximately two days per month.  He is not developing as he should and is falling behind in his potential.  The frustrating thing is that rather than having a clear treatment plan prepared for him over the past two years, since he was diagnosed, his mother is waiting.  She is another mother waiting and he is another child with unrealised potential.  He should not have to rely on the courts and Bills such as this if the authorities really believe in equal opportunities for all.  She should not have to figure this out on her own.<\/p>  <p>  I also recently met a speech and language therapist who told me that in 2011, approximately, the number of speech therapists going through universities was tripled but the jobs were not there when they came out, so they all went to Canada and Australia.

That is the phrase I hear from every parent of a child with autism.<\/p> <p>It is the case for all the families of children with disabilities, but especially so for those families who have children with autism.  They must fight for every inch, every service and every appointment.  They must fight for everything.  To be honest, I have not seen that change in all the years I have been in politics, whether on the council or in the D&aacute;il.  The Government must do so much more to ensure that children with autism can live their lives fully and equally.<\/p> <p> This is particularly the case when it comes to access to education.  One of the things supposed to underpin the philosophy of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, and everything that followed, although that was not implemented in full or anything like it, was a view of education as not only being concerned with the scholastic and the academic.  Education is supposed to be about full development and the widest sense of the word \"education\".  Too often, that aspect seems to be lost and disregarded by the Department of Education.  Families must fight tooth and nail for their fundamental rights and often they must go to court to realise them.  Many people have referred to something as simple as an assessment of need in this regard and many families have been waiting so long that they feel they have no other option but to engage a lawyer and start a legal process.  That often has the desired effect, but it should not have to come to that.<\/p> <p> We remember, and the Minister of State will remember, the shocking discovery just six months ago that the State was keeping dossiers on families forced to pursue legal avenues.  Efforts were made behind the backs of those families to gather information and these parents were treated as objects of suspicion.  I felt that was disgraceful.  When I spoke to the families involved, however, they said they were sickened and disgusted but not surprised.  In and of itself, that is a damning indictment.  Those families are fatigued and broken from fighting a continual uphill battle with a flawed system.  They must fight the Department of Education for basic educational rights.  Cultural change is required in this regard and this adversarial approach must go.  The organisation AsIAm has put this well.  There must be a shift in attitude to ensure that the Department and its officials \"become collaborators, not gatekeepers\" in respect of the provision of the supports required by families who have children with autism.  The waiting times for assessments of need are unbelievable.  I said this previously.  Families in Cork are waiting years, even though such assessments are meant to happen within six months.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State has shown leadership in this area before.  The progressing disability services model, and the elements that saw special schools lose therapies, was paused and the Minister of State was a part of that.  My sense from my communications with schools, however, is that this process is resuming and schools are beginning either to lose therapies and services or are being threatened with that happening.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to pursue this issue.  I am making her aware of it and I would like her to pursue it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000011#J00600","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634722920,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for initiating this legislation.  It dates from 2017 and it is now 2021.  That speaks for itself.  Many elements in this Bill must be implemented and it is urgent that it passes quickly.  I note what this legislation states about the need for joined-up services.  I refer to a communication the HSE sent to a young man with autism who is aged 22.  It stated that he had been selected for a review of his eligibility for a medical card or a GP card.  How must that feel for a 22-year-old man with autism who has had to fight all the way through from his initial diagnosis to accessing all the therapies, and who has now found a job and succeeded against all the odds in doing so?  He has been selected for this review and he was distraught about it.  The communication closed by stating that if this young man does not submit an eligibility review application by 1 December 2021 that his eligibility will expire on 31 December 2021.  This is how we are treating young people with autism and it is not right.  I ask the Minister of State to please talk to the medical card section and tell the staff there that people with autism have it throughout the rest of their lives.  People given opportunities can live a good and fulfilling life, about which my colleagues have talked, and therefore I ask the Minister of State to please tell the medical card section to stop sending out letters like this to people with autism.<\/p>  <p>  I also have another case of a boy aged 15 who is fighting to get into second level schooling.  What is happening is that the system is arguing with the school about the services that need to be provided.  Schools, principals and teachers are not trying to defraud the system.  If these services are required to meet the needs of young people with autism and to give them their educational rights, then they must be provided.  I urge the Minister of State to put those services in place, to talk to the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, and to change the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000012#K00200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1634722920,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I support this legislation and I commend the Regional Group on bringing it forward.  It is important that we see the development and implementation of a cross-departmental and multi-agency autism spectrum disorder strategy.  I support this motion in its entirety, but perhaps some of the language used may be outdated.  It may not reflect where we are now in respect of understanding autism and not speak to the rights-based agenda contained in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Therefore, if the Bill passes this Stage, which I hope it will, I will be introducing some amendments to reflect that aspect on the next Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2019, Deputy Funchion moved a motion on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in calling for an autism empowerment strategy and the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on autism.  The motion received widespread cross-party support and a commitment was given to deliver an autism empowerment strategy for Ireland.  The issues affecting autistic children and adults are long-standing and families, children and adults have been battling for years for their basic rights and entitlements.  Children with autism have faced lengthy waiting times for assessments and longer waiting times for interventions.  In addition, they often struggle to locate an appropriate school place and some children have even found themselves excluded from school entirely.  Adults with autism face huge gaps in the provision of crucial services, particularly regarding finding work and living independently.  This is unacceptable and must change.<\/p>  <p>  An autism strategy which is cross-departmental and multi-agency is much needed and I am happy to support this legislation.  There is, however, also a need to consult with the relevant disabled persons organisations, DPOs, autistic people and their families on any move forward on this issue.  I still want to see the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas committee on autism and a shortened timeframe for the publication of a strategy.  A multi-disciplinary task force, consisting of autistic individuals and-or their family members, must be established to oversee the roll-out of the strategy and to monitor legislative oversight.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, policy on the provision of autism classes at primary and post-primary level is needed.  Consultation must also be undertaken with disability groups and educational stakeholders on the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  It has not been fully rolled out.  There must also be an urgent review of the supports available to adults throughout their lives and an all-island approach should form part of the development of any strategy.

For this reason, I support the Bill and what it is trying to achieve.  I reiterate, however, the point made by Deputy Tully regarding language and terminology.  After a recent engagement with the AsIAm organisation, I am aware that a large proportion of the community dislike the word \"disorder\", as it frames their experience and reality as a sickness and as something being wrong with them.  This is symptomatic of a larger issue in our society concerning the way in which we perceive disability, pathologise it and make it into an illness.  Layers of judgment, prejudice and limiting beliefs are being imposed on individuals who not only have to navigate their additional needs but must deal with the identity of being deemed to have a \"disorder\".<\/p>  <p>  The report from the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, Unmet Needs, highlights levels of inadequacy in the provision of services for many children with additional needs.  In 2020, for example, only 8% of children had their assessments of need completed within the regulation three-month period specified in the Disability Act 2005.  In a response I received on Monday through the parliamentary question system, I was made aware that 9,141 children are currently awaiting appointments for services in areas such as speech and language.  The group AsIAm has also shown that almost eight out of ten families trying to access services for their children with autism were not able to access early intervention teams, school age teams or the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  My colleague, Deputy Funchion, tabled a motion in 2019 addressing the issue of an autism empowerment strategy, as has been mentioned.  I return to this point because even though the motion was passed and received strong cross-party support, the committee that the motion called for was never established.  These are timely plans that we should be implementing, as opposed to kicking the can down the road.<\/p> <p>Exclusion from an early age and the lack of appropriate supports, as we all know, can have negative effects later in life.

There is no question about that.<\/p><p>We have to interrogate the numbers more forcefully.  I do not doubt - I have never doubted - the bona fides of the Minister of State and what she is seeking to achieve.  The issue is one of resources and the lack thereof.  I have sympathy with any line Minister who has to go up against a Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in a budgetary process to fight for resources, particularly resources for children.  We in this House seem to have failed miserably, collectively and historically, when it comes to children and their needs because there is this antiquated process whereby the line Minister of the day, through a budgetary process, has to fight on his or her back for services that should self-evidently be made available.  We all come in here and speak about the needs of children and where society should deliver for children, but the evidence shows that that is not happening in reality.<\/p><p>I am constantly tabling parliamentary questions about the assessment of needs process and the children's disability network teams process.  On 21 September 2021 I received a reply to a parliamentary question - Parliamentary Question No. 1213 of 9 September 2021 - in which I had asked the Minister for Health - for health, I stress - the number of children seen across all areas of intervention in each community healthcare organisation, CHO, area since the commencement of the progressing disability services policy on 19 April 2021 and the number awaiting an assessment in each of those CHOs since the advent of the policy and the children's disability network teams policy.  In CHO 4 there were 997 children still awaiting an assessment.  That is incontrovertible proof that the system has not bedded down and there is more work to be done.  These are the figures produced by the HSE.  The total number of overdue applications was 997.  The number of overdue applications with exceptional circumstances was 238.  The number of overdue applications without exceptional circumstances was 759.  We do not even know if these are real-time figures because the HSE has said that the information that can be provided is for the end of quarter 2 of 2021 and that it is important to note that the activity in that period may have been impacted by the recent cyberattack on the HSE.  As I understand it, applications are deemed overdue if it has been over six months since the application was accepted by the HSE and there is no record of an assessment report being sent to the liaison officer or the applicant.<\/p><p>I say respectfully to the Minister of State that we still have a problem in CHO 4, that is, the Cork and Kerry region.  We still have a problem in Kildare, Dublin and west Wicklow.  There are 936 children awaiting initial assessments.  I ask the Minister of State to use her good offices and to use the weight of her office to lean on the HSE to extract from it commitments that those numbers will come down rapidly and that those children's rights will be met under the Disability Act 2005, which was subsequently the subject of High Court proceedings.  I wanted to raise that specifically because it is pertinent to this debate.  As for Cork and Kerry community healthcare organisation, there are, as I understand it, 14 teams, 11 in Cork and three in Kerry.  However, again through a parliamentary question I tabled, I found that 4,611 children were transferred to the various teams around Cork in April but that only 1,694 of them have had their initial contact with their teams since then.  We all want to give the policy of the children's disability network teams, CDNTs - we are so full of acronyms now - a fair wind, but the measure of success will be in the numbers and the metrics.  If we see relatively low numbers, we will know it is working and at least parents and children will have had that contact with those CDNTs.  However, I have evidence in an email here that I received from one family just last week.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am sorry for the wait in assessing services, but it is taking us longer than expected to meet the children on our caseload due to much-longer-than-expected transfer numbers.  We will, however, be running parent workshops and groups very soon, which will assess parents in helping their children's communication and preparing children for preschool amongst many other areas.  I am in the process of finalising these workshops with my team and you will receive a list of all upcoming interventions very soon. <\/blockquote>  <p>I do not doubt the aims of the community development network teams.  I do not doubt that they are trying to do their best.  However, for parents to receive an email like that on behalf of a child sends a signal to them that here they go again, that they have just come off one list, that they are going onto another one and that they have not really progressed.  In this instance the child has been waiting for about two years for services.  That is deeply upsetting for that family.  If the Minister of State could use her good offices to put pressure on the teams through the CHOs that we need to see those numbers decrease and see the services rolled out, that would give a lot of confidence in the system.  Again, we in the Labour Party will support the legislation - there is no question about that - but what we want to see is the evidence of the system working for children.<\/p><p>Before I sit down, I will refer to one of my local organisations, the St. Joseph's Foundation.  There is a great gr&aacute; for all these section 38 and section 39 organisations.  The relationship between Members of the Oireachtas and these organisations is excellent and we all try to do our very best to ensure that services are rolled out within our service areas and across our constituencies, and beyond our constituencies as well.  However, there is an issue in Cooleens respite services, in St. Joseph's.  If the Minister of State could intervene with St. Joseph's with a view to having that facility reopened, it would give a lot of relief to families in that area.  I again thank the Minister of State.  In fairness to her, she always has an open door and is solutions-driven, and we have to give her credit for that, but there is more work to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000013#L00300","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1634723520,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I am happy to join colleagues in supporting this Bill regarding autism.

In Ireland today more than 14,000 students have an autism diagnosis.  That is one in 65 nationally, so the condition is quite prevalent.  It is also a lifelong condition, as has been highlighted and, without significant support, coping mechanisms and self-education, many sufferers can find that their condition inhabits their career trajectory, their relationships and their general mental and physical well-being.  It is at the extreme end a disability, and a number of Deputies have spoken about the difficulty in accessing a diagnosis of autism.  This is where the Minister of State is going with her autism innovation strategy.  That has to be the first place she goes.  There is extreme hardship out there for families who have been in this system for some time.  They see their kids regressing.<\/p> <p>Schools and teachers are equally frustrated.  They have very little opportunity under the system.

It is a significant problem across the board.  Schools in Waterford are suffering because they are not getting additional SNAs.  They cannot look after children with autism properly.<\/p>  <p>  I want to read into the record some of the statistics from the AsIAm study which say a lot about where we are and what the Minister of State's strategy needs to address.  The study found that 42% of parents and guardians have to wait more than two years to receive an autism diagnosis for their child; 79% said they were not in receipt of any support from the early intervention or school-aged going teams; 70% were broadly dissatisfied with HSE supports; 76% said their autistic children were not receiving any support from child and adolescent mental health services; 40% of respondents said their autistic children had regressed during Covid, which we know; 80% of respondents who confirmed they were in receipt of carers' allowance claimed it was insufficient; and 61% of those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance echoed similar feelings about their capacity to cover costs.  Costs are a major issue.<\/p>  <p>  We are all in agreement that autistic people need to be accepted as citizens in their own right and have the opportunity to be treated equally.

It is now four years since its introduction and the Bill is only on Second Stage.  The issue of services and basic rights for Irish people with autism is one of the subjects that gets plenty of lip service in Leinster House, but there is little action in support of people with autism.  Anyone who has spoken to parents, families or friends will tell us the most heartbreaking stories.  As elected representatives, when we knock on doors we find that in one in ten or 15 houses there is a heartbreaking story behind the door of a family dealing with a lack of services for a child. <\/p>  <p>  Even getting an assessment for autism take many long years on waiting lists.  This can obviously directly inhibit the supports and early intervention that are crucial for the development of a child.  Families are often forced to go down the route of private assessments for children.  For children under three years of age, that can cost as much as &euro;1,500.  For a child over three years of age, the cost can be &euro;950.  For most people, that is an extremely high cost.  For many, it is a preventative cost in terms of getting an assessment in the first place.  Colleagues of mine, including Councillors Sarah O'Reilly and Emer T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, have done vital work to expose the two and three-year waiting lists for assessments and have tried to ensure that parents get what they need.<\/p>  <p>  However, once an assessment has been achieved many families will tell us that they face a cliff edge.  Very quickly, services fall away and are not available when they are needed.  Parents in my constituency have been told to set up their own supports without any help from the Department.  One cohort of parents was told to set up their own school for children with special needs and to fundraise for it themselves.<\/p>  <p>  A good example of this was the establishment of Stepping Stones School in County Meath, which caters for children with special needs.  The school has ensured many children with autism can get targeted tailored education when they need it.  However, with negligible Government supports the school can only do so much.  Teachers and children have been packed like sardines into tiny prefabricated classrooms with rotting floors, holes in walls and rat infestations.  One parent who was involved in the establishment of the school told me the school had originally been designed as a school of dreams, but increasingly it was becoming a house of horrors as the building became increasingly unsafe for students and staff alike.  The promises to help that school go back as far as Noel Dempsey, but permanent accommodation has only been found this year.  I welcome the fact it has been found, but it illustrates the long struggle for families to get what they are entitled to.<\/p>  <p>  It is all too typical for families who have children with autism that their parents are pushed to such extremes just to provide services that they are entitled to.  Autism support groups I have spoken to have described waiting lists and services that are going nowhere.  Another set of parents was told that their child would be discharged from child services at 18 years of age, something I hear regularly.  Once a child hits 18 years of age, he or she is no longer recognised in terms of proper services and supports and hits another cliff edge.  Covid-19 has obviously worsened this state of affairs.  <\/p>  <p>  A survey of childcare professionals revealed that 74% of providers had confessed to seeing regression in children with special needs and disabilities.  The shutting down of schools and supports throughout the pandemic hit these children the hardest.  The Government has done very little to try to mitigate the impact and undo that damage.  <\/p>  <p>  This Bill is an important first step in the right direction to help to ensure that people with autism get the support they need from their Government.  I urge the Minister of State to do the best she can.  I understand there are difficulties with funding for services, but if we are to judge a State or nation on anything, it is on the basis of how it treats people who are most in need.  If the truth were told in this Chamber, this country has significantly let down children and people with autism for decades.  It does not reflect well on us as a people.  Things have to change.  If we are to ensure children with autism achieve their full potential, and there is much potential there, the only way that can be done is through early assessment and intervention and proper supports for them throughout their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000014#M00600","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1634724120,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for using its time to progress this vital Bill.  Like everybody else, I am contacted every week by families who are deeply concerned about a child or family member with autism spectrum disorder who cannot access the therapeutic interventions and educational supports to which he or she is entitled.  This is a key point.  Young people are entitled to these services.  Early interventions will have an incredible developmental impact which improves the quality of life for young people and their families.  The State and Government are aware of these needs.  The only thing missing is the will to provide these vital services.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past two weeks alone, I have met several families who are at their wits' end.  They are angry, concerned and exhausted.<\/p>  <p>One child whose additional needs were first identified in August 2018 has been moved around between services and placed on different waiting lists.  The child also had their file lost but was fortunate enough to belong to a family that was able to get private assessments.  Since the assessment of needs determined that the child would require psychology, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and the support of a physiotherapist support over 14 months ago, they have received one hour of occupational therapy and an hour and a half of speech and language therapy.  The child was forced to get a private assessment for autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and, thanks to the incredible work of the family and local schools, they have started in the early intervention class.  However, if the family had to rely on the public system, the young person concerned would still be waiting for diagnosis and as a result would be inappropriately placed in mainstream classes and would not be getting vital therapies.  We all know the importance of early intervention.  This, as one would guess, has come at considerable emotional and financial cost to the family, with one of the parents changing jobs and taking reduced hours to support their child, not to mention the knock-on effects on the rest of their lives.  A failure by the State to provide basic services forces all responsibility and obligations on to already overstretched families.  In this case, the family are doing everything they can to get private support, but many other children do not have that option.<\/p> <p> Another child is in an early intervention class but the parent is deeply worried about the lack of places in the junior and senior ASD classes in the school.  Compounding this is an overall lack of spaces in schools across Cork South-West.  There are more children in the early intervention class then there are places available in the ASD classes.  Parents are worried sick about what they will do.  Schools are doing the best they can.  What can we say to these families?  Children need special classes but there are not enough spaces.  <\/p> <p> I will give one example of such a situation.  There is almost an equivalent of a small room and a big room with ASD classes in some schools.  There are four classes in one room and four in the next.  Two places are becoming available in the big room in one school because two students are moving on but there are four children in the small room who need a space.  The parent concerned has contacted every other school in the jurisdiction.  The Minister of State knows how uprooting it is for a child to move schools.  The parent has contacted schools more than an hour and a half away and every single one has a waiting list.  This is a clear failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000014#M00700","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634724720,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Let us call that what it is: a lack of action on the part of the special educational needs organiser, SENO, in that particular area.

Not only is it failing to meet the needs of the young people, but it is adding stress and fear onto struggling families.  There is an abundant need for considerably more ASD spaces in schools across Cork South-West, and for a special school.  It is unbelievable that there is not a single special school in Cork South-West.  The closest one is in the city and, as the Minister of State knows, that journey could take more than two hours by car.<\/p>  <p>  The Government likes to talk about a rights-based approach to disability but we actually have a budget-based approach.  Services, therapies and classes are provided according to budgets and not needs.  This is the most sickening part.  We know and understand the need.  The Government, the Departments of Health and Education, and the HSE are all aware.  Being ignorant of an issue is one thing; understanding the matter and the scale and not providing the interventions is negligent and discriminatory.  This, right now, is yet another State scandal.  The problem is it is a slowly unfolding disgrace consisting of waiting lists, referrals and promises of change down the line.  It is a wrong being perpetuated against exhausted families who do not have the energy for another fight.  <\/p>  <p>  This Bill is essential.  I cannot overstate the importance of the immediate passing of the legislation.  It is aimed at addressing the inconsistencies and the availability and types of services for children and adults with ASD.  It provides for the development and implementation of a cross-departmental, multi-agency autism spectrum disorder strategy which can meet the needs of persons with ASD throughout their lives.  While I have given examples of children with ASD, we need services that support people at all life stages, especially as our understanding of ASD evolves.  This is about mechanisms for employment and housing, and for assuring families that adults with ASD can live full, independent lives.  This requires strategies and approaches that can respond to the complexity of autism and plan for the services needed.  The Bill allows for the necessary co-ordinated and strategic services.  I had hoped this was an issue we could all agree on.  We are aware of the urgent need because all our offices are contacted about this regularly and yet the Government seems determined to delay.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State's motion to push back the Second Reading of this Bill by one year is unacceptable.  Not only is it morally wrong, it is deeply insulting to the people concerned and their families.  These children and adults whose lives are spent on different waiting lists and whose services are consistently delayed are being told that the ASD Bill 2017 is going to be pushed back another year.  It is unbelievable.  I heard what the Minister of State said earlier about waiting to see how other matters unfold.  These people have been waiting for long enough.

A similar approach is being taken with the optional protocol to the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We could ratify the optional protocol tomorrow if the Government wanted to, as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the UN special rapporteur have said, but instead disabled people are being told that mechanisms and strategies must be put in place first, despite the fact that other jurisdictions have shown this is not the case.  This Bill cannot wait another year.  The people it is designed to help cannot wait another year, nor can the overstretched families.  When this Bill was discussed in the Seanad over four years ago, it was pointed out that the legislation was already long overdue.  How long will these children and adults have to wait?<\/p>  <p>  We all know cases of young people and adults with ASD who have made incredible progress.  This is down to the dedication, love and sacrifice of their parents, families and communities, in combination with proper supports and therapies, too many of which are accessed privately.  Whole cohorts of children will not receive these vital interventions when they are most effective because of the income of their families or because of where they live.  This has to change.  The Bill allows for a cross-departmental strategy with much-needed monitoring and reporting systems to support people with ASD.  I urge every Deputy to support it and I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment which is, frankly, insulting to families.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State would have liked more funding in the budget and is a strong advocate for that.  Only &euro;65 million in additional funding was added when the Department's own capacity review determined that we needed &euro;350 million to meet the unmet needs of people with disabilities.  It is outrageous that the entire Government was not with the Minister of State when she was seeking more funding.

I commend the Regional Independent Group on this important Bill.  There has been much discussion of the challenges that autistic people face during my time in this House.  Whether progress has been made is a matter for interpretation.  There has been a better understanding of autism in society over the past 20 years and resources have been put in place.  There is no doubt about that and that is good because it is progress.  There are, however, considerable inequalities in the challenges that autistic people face and the services that are provided.  That is what it comes down to.<\/p>  <p>  Assessment and early intervention are absolutely key.  When parents come to my constituency office on a Monday or Friday with issues around intervention for their children, my heart sinks because I know those parents are on a difficult road to try to get services.  If they are coming to Deputies in search of services, it means the system is broken.  Not only is the system broken, the parents are broken.  They are obviously trying to get intervention for their children but that intervention is not available.  They must then go through the courts.  The Disability Act is breached numerous times, which is ludicrous.  I am sure the Minister of State understands the situation is not sustainable for anybody.  Parents have submitted the forms and documentation seeking an intervention but cannot get one and they then take the HSE to court.  That is a ludicrous situation.<\/p>  <p>  We have discussed waiting times.  The average waiting time for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy is two years.  That is not sustainable or acceptable.  I know the Minister of State is trying to address those issues and that is not going to be done overnight but it needs to be done as quickly as possible because parents and children who need the services are struggling.<\/p> <p>Once services are put in place, outcomes are dramatically different for both parents and children.  In my former job, I worked in such services.  Once the services are in place, children can flourish and gain confidence.  They deserve the interventions.  Where they are not made, the outcomes are pretty bad.<\/p> <p> We want to see progress.  Progress has been made but there are enormous inequalities.  Those inequalities relate to the very basics.  If we cannot provide the necessary interventions, we are not addressing the real issue.<\/p> <p> There is now a better understanding.  There is no doubt about that.  Services have been made available, particularly in the past two decades.  Before that, people with autism were completely alienated and put into all sorts of inappropriate services.  I will not go through all that.  They were completely alienated and marginalised in society.  There is now a better understanding.  The major role in services relates to early intervention.  Even if the six-month timeframe in respect of the assessment of need is achieved, it will help.  There are obviously breaches in this regard on numerous occasions but if this can be addressed and people can avail of the services I have outlined, the outcomes will be better, not only for the children and parents but also for society as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000015#N00800","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634725320,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Children with autism have suffered enough.

Services for children with special needs, including autism, were moved from Cork to Limerick when the Government decided to divide the resources by county.

Representatives of the St. Gabriel's centre, which is working out of St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, came to my constituency office in Kilmallock looking for any premises in which they could meet service users in County Limerick.  Luckily, my office, which was a doctor's surgery, was suitable for such a premises.  I gave up a room in my office to facilitate St. Gabriel's so it could carry out assessments of people with autism in a time of pandemic, when the Government let them down.  I am so delighted that my staff and all the friends around me have welcomed the service.  There are those in County Limerick with no assessment infrastructure.

The constituents who are coming to me about autism issues indicate the need for early detection, early intervention and speedy access to the required services.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the content of the strategy, assigns responsibility for its implementation, provides a transparent process for the monitoring of the implementation of the strategy, and also provides guidance on its implementation.  It is so important that autism, including Asperger's syndrome, be recognised early.  We now know that probably one in 68 have the condition.  We believed at one time that one in 500 had it, and before that, in the 1960s, it was believed that one in 5,000 were affected.  Since one in 68 are affected, it is a serious issue for parents.  I deal every day with young parents who are really struggling to gain access to services and timely care and intervention for their children.  Regardless of what group we are in as politicians, it is our job to work for these people and support the implementation of the strategies that are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000016#O00400","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1634725320,"counter":73,"content":"<p>The first point I want to raise is the lack of services and the dire situation of services where therapists are concerned.

I would say I have written at least five times at this stage but have yet to receive a response.  The young child was placed under the school age team and his parents are very anxious that he be prioritised for speech therapy as soon as possible.

I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward this important legislation.  Like many previous speakers, I can say that one of the issues that has been raised with me time and again is that there is a postcode lottery when it comes to the provision of services to children and adults with autism.  The Bill we are debating takes a strategic approach in proposing a cross-departmental, multi-agency ASD strategy.  It means that the services will be joined up, which is very important for people.<\/p>  <p>  For me, perhaps the most important feature of the Bill is that it proposes the adoption of a lifetime approach, which covers the entire life cycle.  That gives confidence to persons with autism and their families.  Second, the Bill assigns responsibility for the implementation of the strategy.  It establishes a clear system of accountability and scrutiny relating to the provision of services to persons with ASD.  That is hugely important because time and again, parents and advocates get lost in the labyrinth of agencies which might perhaps have one responsibility in the area but not another.  Therefore, a strategy which assigns responsibility, ensures accountability and covers the entire life cycle is the type of strategy we need.<\/p>  <p>  All of us know, from speaking with parents and carers, of the intolerable burdens that have been placed on families and caregivers over many years, but particularly over the past year and a half.  We know that waiting lists have increased for many services during that time.  I am only repeating the words of many politicians, but I, too, received heart-rending emails and phone calls.  It is difficult when a parent is advocating for their child and they see the life chances of their own child diminishing in front of their eyes.  Parents have told me that their children are moving backwards because they have only been able to access two, three or five sessions of speech and language therapy or occupational therapy, or whatever service they badly need.  For me, those phone calls are some of the most difficult I receive.  Parents tell me they spend much of their energy trying to get assessments of need for their children and when they finally get those assessments there are few services available, sometimes none, and generally long waiting times.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I submitted questions to the Minister for Health regarding the number of children in counties Sligo and Leitrim currently awaiting assessment, treatment and therapy.  The figures I have are perhaps not up to date.  I have heard the Minister of State speak in the Chamber since then about the fact that children are accessing assessments.  I would be delighted to hear a statement or receive a clarification from the Minister of State on that.  I will not cite those figures now and I will look for them again specifically in relation to counties Sligo and Leitrim.  When I submitted the questions, over 80 children were awaiting initial therapy and over 440 were awaiting speech and language therapy.  While we may have reduced the number of children waiting on assessments of need, has that reduction fed into the numbers waiting on therapies, whether it is speech and language therapy or physical therapy?  I believe the HSE is working to reduce those waiting lists and I accept that Covid has played a role in delays, but it seems that part of the problem is the difference between the number of positions or posts allocated in Sligo-Leitrim and the number of positions that are filled.  For example, I understand that up to 40% of the positions in speech and language therapy in Sligo-Leitrim are unfilled.  What can be done about that?  We can all talk about it, bring it to the Minister of State's attention and complain, and rightly so, but what can be done, what is being done and is there any improvement?<\/p>  <p>  In May last, I submitted questions to the Minister of Education asking if she would consider CHO 1, which covers the Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan area, as one of the areas to be included in the extension of the pilot of the school inclusion model.  The school inclusion model is based on the principle of providing the right support at the right time, delivered by a range of personnel with the relevant qualifications and skills.  Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes and test a model of tailored therapeutic supports that allows for early intervention in terms of providing speech and language and occupational therapies within education settings.  It has already been piloted elsewhere.  I know that Covid has slowed down the extension of the pilot to other areas, but the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, stated quite clearly that funding had been provided in budget 2021 to further roll out the pilot programme to two extra CHO areas.  We are still awaiting an announcement on that.  I ask the Minister to ask his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, how soon that decision will be made.  While I will not ask him to lobby the Minister of State for the CHO 1 area to be included in the pilot, I sincerely hope it will be.<\/p>  <p>  I did not hear all of the Minister of State's intervention because there are committee meetings and other things happening.  I caught the end of her speech, where she talked about the delivery of the autism innovation strategy and how it is under way.  I am satisfied that the Government will not oppose this Bill, because the Minister of State said quite clearly that she supports legislating for services in an equal and holistic manner.  I believe this Bill will certainly achieve that.  I hope it informs Government policy in a real and meaningful way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000017#P00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1634725920,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this draft legislation and the issue today.  I thank Deputy Canney for bringing the issue forward.  As I indicated earlier, I am in the middle of a strategy meeting for another of the Government's national strategies, so I apologise that I was unable to hear the contributions of all Members.  I heard Deputy Canney's contribution and those of Deputies Lowry, Verona Murphy and Berry.  I might come back to some of the other strategies the Government is working on and implementing in terms of a model going forward.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I support the Government's decision not to oppose this Private Members' Bill, the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017, but to propose a timed amendment whereby the Bill will receive Second Stage consideration in October 2022.  As the Minister of State outlined, this will allow time for the development of the national autism innovation strategy, which the Minister of State is leading and is a commitment in the programme for Government.  It also gives us the time to be held to account in our delivery of that autism innovation strategy.  I agree with the Minister of State's comment that we need to give that strategy time to be fully drawn together and implemented.  The element of accountability that so many Deputies spoke about is also important.<\/p> <p>The autism innovation strategy will allow us as a government to respond to the challenges and barriers faced by people with autism more quickly than we would otherwise.  We feel it will allow us to act more quickly than we could otherwise under an Act of the Oireachtas.  As Minister, I recognise the very clear value of national action on autism spectrum disorders, as do my colleagues in government.<\/p> <p> We recognise the very bespoke needs of persons with autism and, as Deputy Lowry said, the very individualised challenges that each person with autism faces.  The issue we are flagging is that legislating for a specific disability carries particular risks in the context of advancing rights for all people with disabilities and delivering disability services in the round.  We have to be aware of the complexities in this regard.  Each category of disability or impairment creates specific and bespoke needs.  Every person with a specific disability argues for special treatment and dedicated supports for themselves or for national strategies to address any one of these.  In the approach we take we have to balance the correct and reasonable imperative to address bespoke barriers and challenges with recognising the universal nature of the issues and the universal rights provided for under the UNCRPD.  Whatever we do, we all wish to avoid creating hierarchies of disabilities in the eyes of the State and the distortions that could arise.<\/p> <p> We have some concerns about the appropriateness of using primary legislation as a vehicle to advance the aims of the Bill.  Primary legislation is static.  It can be altered, updated or reinterpreted only by using subsequent amending primary legislation.  Of course, its rules of construal are quite narrow.  It is based on common law principles.  A high degree of specificity is required to achieve the intended policy effect and satisfy legal requirements.  Any change can only be done through a subsequent lengthy legislative process.  We very much feel that we need the national autism strategy to be dynamic and responsive.  We want to avoid the exposure to risk that would undermine the ability of the strategy to be flexible and agile, to change with developing expert advice and to respond to prevailing circumstances and challenges.<\/p> <p> We also need to act quickly.  This came across from many Deputies in the House.  The strategy needs to be implemented and acted on quickly.  What are needed in such a context are policy-making structures that can respond quickly to the needs of the service users they are designed to support.  This is a central element of the Government's response.  We do have examples of structures that work well, that work in an agile fashion and that are responsive to changed needs of service users.  I refer to the national disability inclusion strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities.  They are whole-of-government platforms for policymaking.  They have the flexibility to respond to changing conditions and definitions.  They also are very much focused on achieving the core objectives set out in each of the strategies.  There are accountability mechanisms built in to these strategies.  There are oversight bodies, forums or committees that bring in the relevant Departments, stakeholders and people who have lived experience of the area.<\/p> <p> I am in the middle of the quarterly forum meeting for the national LGBTI+ strategy.  I have been discussing with NGOs and representatives from a range of Departments our successes in reaching each of the targets.  We have a traffic light score whereby we look at and discuss them.  The NGOs are able to ask why my Department is failing to deliver on X or why the Department of Health is failing to deliver on Y.  There are good structures in place that provide accountability and bring in the people who are most expert in this area because of their NGO or community sector involvement in the area or who are individual service users.<\/p> <p> The autism innovation strategy being developed by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will align with existing strategies, such as the comprehensive employment strategy and the disability inclusion strategy, as well as with the forthcoming UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities implementation plan, which the Department is also preparing.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, stated earlier, the Government in the programme for Government agreed to take action on autism and &euro;100,000 was secured in this year's budget for the development of the autism innovation strategy.  This is provided for in my Department's Vote.<\/p> <p> I want to be absolutely clear that we as a Government are committed to supporting the needs of people with autism.  We have committed ourselves to this course of action and we will do it in the most appropriate fashion and we will get it right.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has already stated her intention to seek expressions of interest from organisations and persons interested in joining the working group to design the autism innovation strategy.  We can also ensure these groups are represented in the oversight mechanisms we put in place.  As I have said previously, this oversight is absolutely essential.  The strategy will see collaborative working across the Government, while ensuring the lived experiences of people with autism inform and enhance in an holistic way how existing national frameworks support people with disabilities.<\/p> <p> While I am here I will take the opportunity to recognise the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in this area.  Her commitment to addressing these issues and being a fierce advocate for the needs of people with disability throughout the country is well known, in particular the needs of people with autism.  I acknowledge this has been recognised by many Deputies in the House.  We have created a new Department that brings responsibility for disability policy from the Department of Justice and responsibility for community disability services from the Department of Health.  What we are looking to do is move the understanding of disability.  Earlier, Deputy Canney said that we should stop looking at disability, and autism as one example, as a health issue.  It is not a health issue.  It is an issue that touches on all parts of a person's life.  We need a Department that is designed in a way that recognises this and that can bring responses to all parts of a person's life and call in all relevant Government bodies and State agencies to be part of the responses.  This is what we are seeking to do in the Department.  I hope that within a year, we will be able to demonstrate through, as one example, the autism innovation strategy our steps towards achieving this unified and holistic response.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy Canney and his colleagues for tabling the Bill and prompting this important discussion today.  The Government's decision is not to oppose the Bill but to propose a timed amendment to postpone Second Stage for consideration until next October.  I welcome Deputy Canney's indication that he will continue to engage with us.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are always open to engagement with any Member of the House on the issues that fall within our remit.  Most importantly, I look forward to working with my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on the design and implementation of the autism innovation strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000017#P00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634726520,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue.  I, along with my colleagues, will support the Bill and will support its progress on Second Stage today.  Autism is not a health issue.  It is a human rights issue.  It is very clear that no clear strategy has been in place here since the European Commission approved the charter of rights for persons with autism in 1996.  This charter was very clear and stated autistic people should have the same rights enjoyed by all EU citizens and that those rights should be enforced by legislation.  Twenty-five years have passed and Ireland has yet to introduce legislation in this respect.  This is shameful and should be rectified immediately.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill before us seeks to provide for the development and implementation of a cross-departmental multi-agency strategy to provide and implement services for autistic people.  It is clear that understanding autism is crucial to the success of the Bill and any strategy that follow it.  Let us be clear.  Service provision for autistic people should never be discretionary.  It should be a human right protected under legislation.  As I have said, it has been 25 years since the European Commission approved the charter of rights for people with autism and Ireland still has not yet introduced legislation to this effect.<\/p> <p>It is clear that if we keep going forward with no change, it will cost more in the long run.  This is simply not an option.  We must act now.  When an autistic child does not get regular access to supports, as was the case during the pandemic, he or she will simply regress.<\/p> <p> On top of this, the financial strain felt by families is only enhanced.  Existing social welfare payments are simply not enough for those families to cover the cost of therapy and additional supports.  A recent study from National University of Ireland Galway found the average annual cost per child for families amounts to more than &euro;28,000 and relates to private services, lost income and informal care.  I work with many families in my constituency office in Dundalk who are trying to cope.  One of the greatest challenges parents face relates to getting regular support and help.  Looking after a child with autism is a full-time job.  Parents need support.  Many are trying to hold down full-time jobs and provide for their autistic child.  One of the greatest challenges they face is when the child progresses from primary to secondary school.  This is often a traumatic time for the child, who is moving into a completely different environment and, quite often, will not get the one-to-one support he or she received in primary school.  More needs to be done at this stage.  The move from primary to secondary school can be life-changing for these children.  I would like to hear other Deputies' views on this.  We need to engage with front-line staff and parents to find out exactly what needs to be done at this critical stage in a child's life.<\/p> <p> As the child grows older, he or she will again face many challenges when leaving secondary school, whether entering third level or even the workplace.  Again, the supports are not readily available at this stage in the child's development.  We have made great strides in recent times in the area of autism.  We are getting to the stage where there is no longer any stigma around autism.  It is accepted it is a condition that needs treatment and support and that those with autism can lead normal lives once they get that necessary help and support.<\/p> <p> I am sure the Minister, like me and other Deputies in the Chamber, will have met plenty of people in his constituency office seeking help for their child.  They cannot afford to spend two or three years on a waiting list or to pay for private assessment.  All we want is the best for our children.  Families who have approached me have had no option but to seek loans.  They go to the banks and credit unions and, as a last resort, to loan sharks.  That is how bad the issue has become.  I have even by contacted by a family who took their child to Poland to have the child assessed.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> Along with the other members of the Regional Group, I intend to support and progress the Bill through Second Stage.  We look forward to working with all Oireachtas parties and stakeholders to ensure the legislation will be fit for purpose and, ultimately, successful.  It will be a game changer for autistic people and will enshrine their rights in law once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000018#Q00200","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634727120,"counter":81,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill is to address the inconsistency that exists throughout the State in respect of both the availability and type of services that are accessible to autistic children and adults through the implementation of a cross-departmental, multi-agency autism strategy.  No strategy has been put in place in Ireland since the European Commission approved the charter of rights for people with autism in 1996.  The charter states autistic people should have the same rights as those enjoyed by all EU citizens and their rights should be enforced by legislation.  This has yet to happen in Ireland after a quarter of a century.  The Bill seeks to do that by providing for the development and implementation of a cross-departmental, multi-agency strategy to provide and implement services for all autistic people.  As the Minister is aware, a motion was passed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with strong cross-party support, for the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas committee that would be mandated to produce an autism strategy for Ireland within six months.  This too has yet to happen.<\/p>  <p>  Autism is complex and two of the greatest battles parents of autistic children face relate to first getting a diagnosis and then, after that long and tortuous diagnosis struggle, the inaccessibility of regular supports.  These battles contribute to the regression of autistic children's interpersonal education and skills, which has been compounded by the current pandemic.  It is the same story across the board for parents, where issues begin to arise only when the child begins preschool or primary school.<\/p>  <p>  I am dealing with the case of Mary and her son David, who is in fourth class.  They have had to go private to secure a diagnosis because of the current waiting list for CAMHS referral and occupational therapy, OT, and educational psychological assessments.  They have been forced to go down this road, borrowing from grandparents, because David would be in secondary school before he would get access to any of the appointments in the current public system due to the horrendous waiting lists.  Now, after forking out for a private educational assessment, the family find themselves in the position of having to make up the grant shortfall of &euro;800 for assistive technology because the Department of Education will fund only a basic laptop and not the specific laptop recommended by the educational psychologist to meet David's needs.  This is before the family begin to consider the additional cost of equipment required for various therapies that can assist David.<\/p>  <p>  His mum has been advised he is likely to need physiotherapy in a couple of years to assist him with his condition.  Given the current waiting lists, this means that, ideally, he needs to be placed on a waiting list now in a pre-emptive move to ensure he can access such services when he needs them.  David has qualified for the incapacitated child tax credit, yet his mother has been refused the domiciliary care allowance.  How can we say, on the one hand, that a child is incapacitated but that he does not require additional attention from another Department beyond that of a child of a similar age on the other?<\/p>  <p>  The financial pressure placed on this family, or any other family in a full-time caring role, is horrendous.  A recent study from National University of Ireland Galway found the average annual cost for families of an autistic child amounted to more than &euro;28,000, relating to private services, lost income and informal care.  What about children whose grandparents are not in a position to pay for such interventions?  They are at the mercy of the ever-growing public waiting lists.  The State is failing in its obligation to provide the early intervention and support these children urgently need.  Surely it makes more sense to invest in our children early in order that they can reach their full potential and actively contribute to our society and tax system in future.  This can happen only if the correct supports are put in place as early as possible rather than if we fail to meet their needs and, potentially, be forced to support them through the social welfare system into adulthood.<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Group has restored this Bill and intends to make numerous amendments to it on Committee Stage, especially in regard to the terminology within its current draft.  It was introduced initially by the then Senator James Reilly, the former Minister for Health, and passed all Stages in the Seanad but fell due to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il in January 2020.  Our group's members look forward to working with all Oireachtas parties and stakeholders to ensure this legislation will be fit for purpose and successful.  It will be a game changer for autistic people as it will enshrine their rights in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000019#R00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634727120,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634727120,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Motion, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1634727720,"counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000020#S00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1634727720,"counter":85,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach knows, children from Donegal whose families have been affected and devastated by the mica scandal are protesting outside the D&aacute;il and are standing in the rain as we speak.  They left their homes and the hills of Donegal at 6 a.m. this morning.  These children should not have had to travel all the way to Dublin.  Like all others, these children should enjoy a carefree childhood and they should not have to worry about their homes crumbling around them.  They should not have to witness the intense and often unbearable pressure that their parents and wider families live with every day.<\/p><p>On Monday we heard from Mackenzie McDaid, aged 12, speaking about how living in a mica-affected home impacts on her.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI worry when I go to sleep that the roof is going to fall on top of me.  I was sleeping in my bedroom and I heard a big bang and a big pile of plaster had fallen off the wall.  There are 15 out of 16 in my class who have mica and know that they have mica.  We would be very worried and we kind of comfort each other by talking to each other about it. <\/blockquote>  <p>Outside the gates of the D&aacute;il this morning more children told me of how they wish their home to be their happy place.  They asked why they have to be afraid when they are playing in their home place.  They had written to the Taoiseach and they asked him to come out and meet them.  They are disappointed that they have not seen the Taoiseach and they want him to come out, look them in the eye and explain to them why they are living this nightmare.<\/p><p>The mica and pyrite scandal affects families in Donegal as well as families in Mayo, Sligo, Limerick, Clare and Tipperary.  Support for all these victims of mica and pyrite is not just national but international because all of us can at least try to understand the heartache and trauma of your family home and sanctuary crumbling around you.  The impact on people's mental health and relationships has been immense and families have been broken by this.  In June I visited some of the homes again and on that visit I heard the stories of gable walls cracking, chimneys about to collapse and all of the misery this causes.  I have spoken to people who live in caravans but who still pay a big mortgage for a home that is disintegrating.  These families have asked me time and again to put their cases front and centre.  That is why the motion for 100% redress came in June and it was passed unanimously by the D&aacute;il but it seems to me it is being ignored by the Government.<\/p><p>N&iacute;l s&eacute; seo c&oacute;ir ar na teaghlaigh seo.

Those affected by the scandal have had their fill of promises and they have had enough tea and sympathy from Government.  They want a solution.  These families wait and wait while staring at cracks in their homes and enduring the cracks in their lives.  This is a matter of justice.  Does the Taoiseach support 100% redress?

The homes are in a terrible condition in many instances and a range of issues have to be addressed.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, set up a working group arising from meetings I had in Donegal with homeowners and Donegal County Council during the summer.  The mechanism by which the new scheme will have to be administered is key.  It is not as simple as the Deputy presents it but things, of course, never are.  The Deputy, from her perspective, will present it in a simplistic way.<\/p>  <p>  Enormous provision will have to be made to deal with the mica situation to refurbish housing, to give guarantees and to underpin people's sense of security in their homes for the long term.  A range of actors are involved in this, including insurance companies, and it seems to me that a lot of people have left the scene.  The Government is now the one agency that can help the residents and homeowners and it intends to do that in a comprehensive way.  The scheme will be far more significant than the last scheme, which was significant in itself and which the Deputy welcomed at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000020#S00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1634727720,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Yes, and it failed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000020#S00400","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1634727720,"counter":88,"content":"<p>You and Deputy Mac Lochlainn thought it was okay so let us not be all self-righteous, coming in and saying that you are the great guardian and defender.

We know from yesterday that the Government's definition is unknown.  After yesterday, there has been a lack of consistency, as I am sure the Taoiseach is aware.  Many people have been in touch with me, my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, and all of us about what was announced.  It is unworkable and incomprehensible.  The Government should have consulted in advance.  The cart was put before the horse.  A number of weeks ago, we were one of the few parties in opposition that supported the extension of the regulations, so we understand where the increasing case numbers left the Government.  However, this industry has been on its knees.  We need consistency in the approach.  The Covid certificate has to be enforced properly.  We need industry buy-in in that regard.  We also need to ensure that there are proper regulations and guidance around ventilation, something that always seems to be forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking as someone who worked for F&aacute;ilte Ireland for nearly a decade, what is being put to it and others in terms of how they are meant to create rules around unnatural regulations will simply not work.  A pub that changes into a night club cannot change its rules in a matter of minutes.  People at live entertainment can stand up and dance, but if they are in a night club, they can only dance.  This is all unnatural.  We need to get back to first basics - personal responsibility, the 100% imposition of certificates, ventilation, etc. - but asking F&aacute;ilte Ireland and others to do this will not work.  It is not natural and these rules are ridiculous.  I hope the Government will bear that in mind.<\/p>  <p>  It is a year since I first raised in the House the matter of antigen testing.  We have lost a year, but now antigen testing is deemed important.  Before we ever went to the convention centre, I stood up in this Chamber and asked about antigen tests because I used them to ensure protection when visiting my elderly parents.  A year later, they are only now being considered.  Will the Government use antigen testing in schools?  The INTO has asked for this and I support it.  Will the Government ensure that serial testing in nursing homes begins again for a period?  It is a necessary and responsible thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  We know what the healthcare sector, including hospitals, is facing into.  Like the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, I am surprised that the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, and the Government have not made the decision to give booster vaccines to healthcare workers.  Will the Taoiseach please ask NIAC to revert to the Government with recommendations in that regard within a number of days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000021#T01700","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1634728320,"counter":116,"content":"<p>First of all, Deputy, I have to state that there are 464 people in hospital this morning.  There are 74 in intensive care.  My central objective and that of the Government is to protect lives and protect people's health.  That has to be central to our consideration above and beyond anything.  This is not giving out to anybody or criticising anybody, but it has to be central and it has to inform our approach.<\/p>  <p>  Since the spring time, we have comprehensively, gradually and cautiously reopened society, with significant benefits.  Thousands of people are back at work, less than 100,000 compared to 400,000 are now on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, consumer spending is surging and the economy is enjoying growth periods because of that cautious reopening.  What is critical is that, as we reopen further in the context of a deteriorating situation in relation to the prevalence of the disease and its penetration into hospitals, we do so in a cautious way.  That is the central message of yesterday.  As I said yesterday, there will be sectoral guidance issued to different sectors, but what is extremely important is that it is ring-fenced for live entertainment and it does not spread right across the hospitality sector.  That is very important, because otherwise that would have inherent dangers in terms of the spread of the disease.  This is not simple and there are challenges, but we will work and we will get them resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I recall the rows in the convention centre when we brought in the digital Covid certificate.  One would have imagined at the time that we had abandoned everything - civil liberties and the whole lot of it - with parties attacking us left, right and centre for bringing in the digital Covid certificate, and now it is accepted as a key protective measure to enable not just the reopening of hospitality, but keeping it reopened.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the decisions yesterday, it was last Wednesday that the Government was alerted to the deteriorating situation.  There was a meeting with senior officials and NPHET wanted a number of days more to see the pattern in terms of case numbers and so forth.  Hence, there was a meeting of NPHET on Monday and the Government meeting on Tuesday.  Government leaders considered NPHET's advice late Monday evening.  I accept that the night time economy sector has not got great notice in relation to this, but that is because of how things have evolved.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy used a good phrase: \"It is not natural\".  Covid is not natural, and that is the problem.  Covid is not natural, there are many twists and turns with it and it can upset the best-laid plans.  We thought two weeks ago that we would be opening without restrictions.  That has changed.  What we now must do is try to protect things.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of antigen testing, to be fair to the Deputy, he was consistent in raising that issue.  He knows, as we all do, that there have been different perspectives on it among public health experts and so on, but we are now ruling on it.  The Deputy referred to NIAC and the Government.  Let us be clear - the clinical advice is there, unless the Deputy is suggesting that we now override the national immunisation advisory committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000021#T01800","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1634728320,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Ask it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000021#T01900","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1634728320,"counter":118,"content":"<p>We have asked it.

Is it because of vaccines not working as effectively as we thought, is it because many children under 16 years of age and-or 10% of adults are not vaccinated, or is it a combination of all three?

Three weeks ago, eight senior consultants at University Hospital Kerry wrote to general practitioners and elected members stating: \"Our hospital is in crisis since the second week of September.\"  The letter went on to state that elective surgery has been cancelled, there are high numbers of patients on trolleys in the emergency department, there are staff shortages and staff burn-out, that no surgical day ward is operating and that the acute medical assessment unit is closed more often than it is open.<\/p>  <p>  There are 2,300 people on waiting lists for elective surgery, many of them in pain.  Elective surgery has been cancelled.  Elderly people up to 90 years of age are on trolleys in corridors for two or three days as they wait for a bed.  That is not right.  A respectable senior citizen who operated a highly respectable business in Killarney for many years died on a trolley in Tralee hospital.  UHK needs 100 additional nurses.  We need an independent assessment and external review to identify what has gone wrong in order that we can rectify the situation.  I am told that senior decision-makers and on-call management rotas are practically non-existent at weekends, that elderly people are being sent home in ambulances without a homecare plan in place, with many of those who can walk being sent home in taxis, that ambulances are queuing for three to four hours waiting to unload at the accident and emergency department and that ambulances assigned to Kerry, which operate on a 12-hour shift basis, are being redeployed at the start of a shift to areas in Cork and as far away as Dungarvan and that they often complete that shift in Clonmel, leaving Kerry unserviced during that entire shift.  Reconfiguration of the ambulance service in 2012 has resulted in a reduction of service in Kerry.  Staff are exhausted, mentally and physically.  Last month, there were 422 patients on trolleys while four years ago, there were only 114 people on trolleys.

This information is crucial if we are to have an informed debate on NAMA, the role it is currently playing and on why is a State agency selling new houses it is building at prices at the top of the market.  It is selling two- and three-bedroom apartments in Dublin for prices starting at &euro;525,000.  It is pushing for the maximum prices, thus fuelling rising house prices.  Why is it not being used to solve the housing and rental crises?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000022#U01300","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634729520,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact the Deputy has raised this issue because I checked the issue raised in the House yesterday by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The narrative I have received is somewhat different from that presented yesterday.  For example, during Leaders' Questions, I think Deputy Boyd Barrett made reference to the article in the <i>Business Post<\/i>on properties located in Finglas, several of which were reported to have been vacant.  NAMA does not own the apartments in question, rather it acquired the debtor's loans which were secured by various apartments located in a larger development in Finglas.  The apartments were controlled by a receiver who was appointed in December 2012.  While the apartments had been completed prior to NAMA acquiring the loans, the receiver discovered after his appointment that the apartments were not fully compliant with relevant health and safety requirements and needed necessary remediation works, which were funded by NAMA.  NAMA provided in excess of &euro;10 million in funding to the receiver in order to remediate the apartments.  This remediation commenced in 2017.  Some 26 of the apartments which were remediated first were left vacant in order to temporarily house tenants who had to vacate other apartments in the wider development while the remediation works were being carried out on the units they occupied.  That is much different from what was presented yesterday.  This is standard practice and ensures tenants are appropriately accommodated in the same location while works are under way on their homes.  These remediation works were not fully completed until 2020.  At this point, unexpected delays were encountered due to the pandemic and the need to resolve complex legal issues, <i>inter alia<\/i>, with Dublin City Council, which were not resolved until June of this year.  These issues impeded the receiver's ability to lease or sell the apartments sooner.  As a result the apartments were not leased prior to being placed on the open market by the receiver this June.  Before placing the units on the market, NAMA confirmed with Dublin City Council that it had no appetite to acquire the units.  While NAMA does not own residential properties, it ensures its debtors and receivers keep vacant periods in residential properties to a minimum.  The presentation of this yesterday differs significantly from the facts there.<\/p><p>There is a wider issue with respect to NAMA's overall role and the legislation that underpinned the creation of the agency was fundamentally different from that in terms of the housing situation and the situation we are currently in.  NAMA has on previous occasions offered blocks of housing and apartments to local authorities.  Some have been taken up and some have not been.  There is an ongoing issue, which we will keep under review, with how NAMA evolves in the coming while and the contribution it can make to helping with the provision of more housing and resolving the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000023#V00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1634729520,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

That landholding and those cash reserves are capable of delivering up to 80,000 affordable and cost-rental homes.  We know NAMA has been selling apartments for up to &euro;500,000 and more.  I put it to the Taoiseach and his Government that we must have a proper discussion and debate around NAMA and its role.  We need that information and we need a map with details on the land the agency currently holds, which is what I asked the Taoiseach for.  We need a list of property portfolios, especially vacant units.  We must know who NAMA is selling properties to and for how much, and whether NAMA receivers are evicting tenants.

Its insurance went from &euro;26,000 to &euro;88,000.  Clearly, further reform is required in the insurance sector, with particular focus on the duty of care to ensure an appropriate balance in responsibilities between parties.  The Government must ensure that changes to duty of care legislation are prioritised to help save businesses that are crippled by insurance companies.

Implementation of the proposal requires a range of legislative and operational changes.  Initial draft regulations were forwarded to the Road Safety Authority, RSA, for observation.  It is anticipated that these will be sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, shortly.  Other regulations such as those determining fees may also need amendment.  In addition, the RSA is revising its operational procedures to accommodate the change.  At this stage, the division is currently working towards a 1 December commencement date, although this is dependent on no significant issues arising.  As the Deputy knows, as part of the provisions made due to the Covid-19 pandemic and to ease the burden on medical services, the requirement for persons of 70 years of age or older to submit a medical certificate was removed.

It is also timely as tomorrow is world credit union day.  The first objective of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997 and in particular, to provide for the amendment of objects of credit unions, to include the provision to its members of additional financial services as are for their mutual benefit.  The Credit Union Act 1997, as it stands, largely limits the role or objects of credit unions to accepting savings and providing loans.  There is an additional list of services credit unions can provide approved by the Central Bank and subject to conditions.  However, this list is outdated in the rapidly changing world of financial services provision.  In order for any credit union to expand its range of services outside of this list, such as providing current account services, specific Central Bank approval is required for each credit union.<\/p><p>This Bill would allow a credit union to provide a greater range of financial services to its members, such as current accounts, where the following conditions are met: that such financial services are for their mutual benefit, as determined by the board of the credit union and that the credit union in question would hold, where applicable, any and all authorisation required under the relevant financial services legislation.  That last point is crucial because it makes it crystal clear credit unions must operate fully and wholly in compliance with the relevant legislation pertaining to the financial services they wish to offer.  Whether a credit union can offer a regulated financial service to its members should not be at the sole discretion of the Central Bank.<\/p><p>The second objective is to provide for the establishment of a credit union policy committee.  The purpose of the committee would be to review the impact of Central Bank policy on credit unions and provide feedback to the Central Bank on its policy development process.  This would be a formal consultation process and the Central Bank would be expected to have regard to the deliberations of the policy committee.  The committee would be set up by the Minister and should include persons with expertise and experience in the sector.  Such a committee would mirror the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, which is already set up to advise the Minister.<\/p><p>The third objective of the Bill is to provide for miscellaneous matters relating to credit unions.  First, it would require the Central Bank obtains the consent of the Minister for Finance when prescribing the minimum regulatory reserve requirement for credit unions.  Currently, the Central Bank prescribes the minimum regulatory reserve ratio, which is 10% of the assets of a credit union.  It is worth noting the Irish figure of 10% for credit unions is much more than what is required from high street banks in Ireland and significantly more than credit unions in Australia, the US or Canada.  Whatever the figure, the Minister for Finance must give his or her consent to setting that figure.  It is also proposed that when amending a common bond, the Central Bank shall have regard to the common bond of other credit unions and ensure there is no overlap.  It is really important the unique nature of the common bond should not be arbitrarily altered.<\/p><p>Finally, it is proposed the Central Bank will administer the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions in an appropriate way and with a view to the protection of the community-based and volunteer ethos of credit unions.  This is crucial because it is what differentiates credit unions from other financial institutions.  They are not-for-profit and member-owned financial institutions and are run according to a volunteer ethos.  This must be recognised and taken into account by the Central Bank in all its dealings with credit unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000027#Z00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1634731920,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000027#Z00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1634731920,"counter":261,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000027#Z00500","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634731920,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1634731920,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000027#Z00650","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1634731920,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000027#Z00700","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1634731920,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Flood Insurance Bill 2021: First Stage","time":1634731920,"counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000027#Z00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1634731920,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for fairness in the market for property insurance, and to provide for related matters. <\/blockquote>  <p>The Flood Insurance Bill 2021 is designed to provide for fairness in the market for property insurance and related matters.  This legislation is intended to address a situation of blatant unfairness which discriminates against businesses and private property owners in flood-affected areas where remedial work has been carried out by the Office of Public Works to mitigate against flooding.  Following a 2007 EU directive, the OPW was tasked with completing flood insurance schemes to the necessary specification and many of these works have been completed nationwide.<\/p><p>Despite this, the insurance industry has refused to provide cover for homeowners in some of the areas where flood relief work was completed.  In my home town of Bray, I have met and talked with and campaigned alongside many individuals residing in the flood-affected areas of Little Bray and I have witnessed their despair, frustration and anger first hand.  In 1986, Hurricane Charlie devastated Wicklow, flooding and damaging many homes and dozens of businesses in the Little Bray area.  More than 350 jobs were put at risk because of the flooding that followed the storm.<\/p><p>It was the resulting campaign which, like many others throughout the country, ran for many years afterwards as ordinary people and small businesses fought to preserve their homes and livelihoods that would lead to the River Dargle flood protection scheme on which the OPW carried out remedial work to the cost of &euro;46 million and was completed in 2017.  I acknowledge and applaud the efforts of groups such as SWAP, the community of the Little Bray area and the OPW.<\/p><p>The failure of the insurance industry to provide insurance cover to homeowners in flood-affected areas that have been remedied is simply outrageous and totally unacceptable.  This legislation will end this unfair practice by the insurance industry.  It will prevent it from continuing with its discriminatory practices against homeowners and businesses.  This legislation will offer protection to homeowners and businesses who are situated in areas the OPW has designated as having a one-in-100-year risk or better.  This legislation will offer further protections by entitling property owners to bring forward complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman, where they believe the insurance companies were attempting to overcharge for premiums or if they have unreasonably been denied insurance.  This legislation will also empower the Central Bank to carry out assessments of individual insurers and the way they deal with applications for insurance from property owners in the affected areas.<\/p><p>It will allow the Financial Services Ombudsman the authority to direct an insurer to offer insurance to customers at a price and on terms it sees as fair, reasonable and appropriate.  Flood insurance is not only a matter for homeowners, as important as it may be.  Fair and equitable insurance is critical to the existence of local businesses.<\/p> <p>Only this morning in the Chamber, I spoke about the closure of a local business in Wicklow due to extortionate insurance fees.  Its insurance premium jumped from &euro;26,000 to an incredible &euro;88,000 per year.  Without insurance businesses cannot survive.  Without business and commerce, our communities will not survive.  However, it is the ordinary homeowners who are most at risk.  It is they who are being unduly and unfairly punished and who are being discriminated against by the insurance companies.

The committee met most recently on Monday, 30 August.  The committee will meet again next week.  On 31 August, the Government published the statement, Covid-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing our Recovery and Reconnecting.  Since 1 September, we have continued our careful and gradual approach to reopening, while supporting maximum reach of the vaccine programme and allowing time to achieve the full benefits for all those currently being vaccinated.  The plan included a proposed transition in our approach to public health management of the disease from 22 October, subject to vaccination levels and the incidents and behaviour of the disease at the time.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, met on Monday evening and provided advice to Government.  Given the urgency of the matter and the time available, this advice was considered by the Cabinet committee on Government co-ordination on Monday evening, in advance of discussion and decisions being taken by the full Cabinet yesterday morning.  <\/p>  <p>  At that meeting, continuing with a cautious approach, the Government agreed that the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sectors can re-open, with the full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the Covid-19 pass, in light of the high level of disease in the community at this point in time and the uncertain trajectory of the disease.  Protective measures include requirement for Covid-19 pass, vaccine or recovery certificate for indoor hospitality and events, social distancing and the wearing of face masks as appropriate.  Masks can be removed obviously for alcohol consumption or food consumption.  There is table service only in hospitality settings, with a maximum of ten adults per table and a maximum of 15 including children, as well as collection of contact tracing data.  Event-specific sectoral guidance will issue for indoor live music and drama, live entertainment and sporting events.  Specific sectoral guidance on night clubs will issue, setting out appropriate protective measures.  This will include Covid-19 passes, contact tracing data collection, amongst other measures.  Covid-19 passes and fixed capacity limits will not apply for outdoor events.  However, sectors should ensure appropriate protective measures are in place.<\/p>  <p>  Organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place and, where indoor groups have a mix of vaccinated and non-vaccinated people indoors, pods of six should apply.  Fixed capacity limits will not apply to those indoor and outdoor group activities.  Religious services and weddings can proceed without capacity limits but with all other protective measures remaining in place.  Return to workplaces will continue on a phased and cautious basis for specific business requirements.  Sector-specific guidance and protocols including with regard to work, hospitality, culture and sporting events will be reviewed and strengthened where appropriate.  Compliance activities will be reinforced by relevant bodies and through wider public and stakeholder communications.  The meeting with the regulators' forum will be convened to discuss further with relevant Departments and agencies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000028#AA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1634732520,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The six speakers have one minute each.

I want to also raise with the Taoiseach the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton, County Cork, which closed its short-term respite and mental health day care services throughout the pandemic.  In June, families of long-term patients learned that the HSE intends to permanently close the facility under the guise of inspection reports undertaken by the Mental Health Commission.  To be clear, the commission has not called for the closure of Owenacurra.  Rather, it has reported urgent action and that investment is needed to make the centre safe.  This is not some antiquated 19th-century building.  It was built in the 1960s.  It requires modernisation after years of under-investment.  My time is limited, but I ask the Taoiseach to act on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000028#AA02000","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1634732520,"counter":289,"content":"<p>We do not offer antigen testing, which is unfair to those who cannot get a vaccine.  The simple application of an antigen test would solve this.  Is this being considered at all?  Antigen testing is being considered for close contacts.  How will this work?  Will people have to apply?  Who do they apply to?  Why can we not give antigen tests freely, maybe to test centres, in order that people who need them can acquire them?  Another area of confusion concerns the booster programme.  While I welcome the programme, I have had many queries about it.  Some GPs locally tell me they cannot administer it.  There do not seem to be guidelines on what to do or where to go to access it.<\/p>  <p>  My last question is on ventilation.  What are schools meant to do when they have exhausted all recommendations and the CO2 monitors the Department supplied to them are still recording inadequate levels?  Some schools in Carlow contacted me on this.  It is worrying because the figures have risen so much again.  Ventilation seems to be one of the biggest issues going forward.  I ask that the Taoiseach address this and come back to me.  We need to support people, businesses and individuals who are trying to recover.

I had an eye-opener in respect of the failure of the Government to address this problem when an ICU nurse came into my clinic this week.  She has been offered a job in a Dublin hospital as an ICU nurse, but she is on a Stamp 1 visa and needs a Stamp 4 visa.  She went to get an appointment at the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, to get her Stamp 4 visa.  She was told that she could not get an appointment until December, in which case she will lose the job and we will be down one ICU nurse.  That is, in effect, one ICU bed.  That backlog is unacceptable.  It shows a lack of focus in ensuring that we get ICU nurses where they are available.

I want pay tribute to Ms Vicky Barron, the principal of CBS Primary School in Wexford town.  The school made the decision to close because more than 10% of their pupils had Covid-19.  She appropriately made the point on the radio that the HSE says this is not a school outbreak.  What is it, then?  It did not come out of the walls.

The programme for reopening continued without a hitch right up until this weekend.  That is why there was no necessity for meetings.  I had conversations with the Chief Medical Officer to keep track of progression.  We are progressing well.  Society has reopened effectively.  The economy has bounced back with thousands more jobs and the number receiving the pandemic unemployment payment reduced to under 100,000.  The situation was okay.  The public health people were happy with schools.  Last Wednesday, the senior officials group was alerted by public health officials about the deteriorating situation.  They wanted some more days to see how the data would unfold in terms of a pattern.  They decided to meet on Monday.  We were apprised of that on Monday evening and took a decision on Tuesday morning, which has led to a different timeline for the sectors involved.  The Cabinet Covid committee will meet again next week.<\/p>  <p>  On the recognition of front-line workers, there is a consultation with social partners, including employers, employee unions, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to identify the best means and approach to recognise front-line healthcare workers for their work during Covid.  The Covid committee is independent of and separate from the healthcare committee, which deals with wider issues regarding capacity and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald asked about sector-specific guidance.  Throughout the pandemic, different Departments have worked with sectors and agencies to provide sector-specific guidance.  We will do that with the various areas that are being reopened as a result of NPHET's advice and the Government decision yesterday.  The Minister and the HSE are dealing with the Owenacurra Centre in Cork.  It is not really a matter for the Covid committee.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Murnane O'Connor, PCR testing is available for those who cannot get a vaccine and so is antigen testing.  The booster vaccination has already been made available for those aged over 80 and is being administered.  We have not come across any issues with that with immunosuppressed residents in nursing homes.  It will be extended to the over-60s.  The HSE will put that into operation.  It seems that GPs will be involved with over-70s and vaccination centres could be used for over-60s.  Those are preliminary statements and it remains to be put into operation by the HSE, which will make decisions and announce them shortly.<\/p>  <p>  I talked with the Minister for Education about the issues raised with regard to CO2 monitoring because ventilation is important and CO2 monitors create awareness if there is an issue in a classroom.  We will get a report about that.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I am not responsible for the issuing of visas for individual applications but I have made it clear that we want as rapid an acceleration of the recruitment of healthcare professionals as we can possibly have in the current situation.  Substantial resources have been made available.  Some 6,000 additional healthcare workers were recruited last year, with 8,000 to be recruited in 2022.

The review was taken after the helicopter operator, CHC Ireland, challenged the report into the crash.  The family hired legal teams because they had a reasonable fear that there would be an effort during the review to assign blame for the accident to the crew members who died.  The families were dragged into the review because they felt that the Department would not defend their loved ones.  They now find themselves faced with legal bills of hundreds of thousands.  It is scandalous that the Department did not agree to pay the families' costs in the first place.  It is more scandalous that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has argued against supporting and paying those costs.  I hope that the Taoiseach will agree that this is a horrendous way to treat the families of people who died in the line of duty.

He seeks the right to remain here as a refugee.  He is a Muslim from India and said to <i>breakingnews.ie<\/i>:&quot;If I go back to India I will be killed.&quot;  There is reason for him to believe that because both of his parents were killed in 2018 and he came here in the context of that.  They were killed in the context of anti-Muslim violence, which unfortunately is now commonplace in India and is whipped up by the chauvinist Modi regime.  Ironically, one of the reasons he is being refused is that he cannot get written confirmation from the Indian police of the circumstances in which his parents died.  Given the role of the Indian state in anti-Muslim violence, that is hardly surprising.<\/p><p>There are two issues here.  One is the immediate issue of the hunger strike and the danger to his health and life and I appeal to the Government to reach out and make a phone call to Nadim today and promise to take his case seriously.

The Deputy said the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has argued against paying the legal costs.  Has he publicly argued against it?

That is not acceptable.  That was not the reason these were brought in some years back.  The idea was to get supply into the housing market and get houses built.  If people get planning permission, they should build housing or apartments.  If they do not, we will introduce a tax to penalise those who hoard land to secure an increased valuation.  We have to disincentivise people hoarding land or endeavouring to increase the value of land through zoning or planning permissions.  We want a situation where you use it or lose it, or you get penalised for hoarding land.  That is an important measure we took in the budget to try to get a move on in terms of housing supply.

I have said repeatedly and consistently to Members in this House that it is extremely important that workers in the fishing industry are protected and well looked after.  We have had too many incidents in recent years where cases have arisen in which the rights of workers were clearly not upheld or basic documentation could not be provided or secured in respect of some workers on fishing boats.  Where accidents happened or rescues took place, some workers were discovered not to have any documentation at all.  That potentially lends itself to significant abuse of such workers.<\/p> <p> In terms of work permits being tied to a boat, work permits, generally speaking, have been applied for by employers.  We take on board the conclusions of the report and we will engage with the Department, the fishing industry and the Minister involved.  The fishing industry is going through a traumatic period at the moment and this is something we cannot afford to allow happen within the sector.  It needs to be stamped out.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cian O'Callaghan raised the issue of safeguarding.  He raises a very substantive issue as to whether we should pass legislation to ask the Garda to pass on information it has.  That opens up a whole new area.  We need a regulatory framework to govern any organisation that is established in an area such as homelessness.  We do it for a whole range of other activities.  We should use the tried and trusted organisations that are involved in homelessness that have an established relationship with local authorities and the Government.  The days are gone when a body can declare itself to be a homeless charity.  There is too much of that going on.  Some well meaning people do it, but it creates difficulties and challenges.  Organisations such as the Simon Communities of Ireland, Focus Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that have long experience of homelessness and that have built up a lot of expertise have done a lot of research and they work collaboratively internationally.  We need that informal opinion to inform policy on housing.  A variety of other organisations that I have not mentioned do likewise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000030#CC00900","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1634734320,"counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000031#DD00200"},{"type":"question","time":1634734320,"counter":326,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[43783\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000031#DD00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change met last","asker":"1545","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1634734320,"counter":327,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[44763\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000031#DD00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet Committee on the environment and climate change last met and will next meet.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1634734320,"counter":328,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[45168\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000031#DD00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1634734320,"counter":329,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[47963\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000031#DD00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change will next meet.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1634734320,"counter":330,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[47966\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000031#DD00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change will next meet.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1634734320,"counter":331,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[51085\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000031#DD00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change last met.","asker":"1627","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1634734320,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 21, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change last met on Monday of this week, 18 October, and a further meeting will be scheduled in the coming weeks.

Some &euro;15 million was allocated after some big protests by taxi drivers during the period of Covid for grants to be available to them to get electric cars.  To their disappointment and surprise in recent weeks, they were told that although only &euro;6 million out of the &euro;15 million grant scheme has been used up, no further applications are being accepted.  That is inexplicable if we want to see the decarbonisation of the taxi fleet.  Also, bizarrely, if people had committed to buy an electric vehicle that was worth more than &euro;60,000, there would be an extension on the grant being available to them until March of next year, but if a commitment had been made to purchase a vehicle worth less than &euro;60,000, it would not.  That is bizarre.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand, for some inexplicable reason, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants for taxi drivers have a similar threshold of &euro;60,000 in order to get a &euro;2,500 grant.  You get the money if you are a rich taxi driver who can afford a very expensive electric car, but not if the car is worth less than &euro;60,000.

In fact, it finds that it is at 110% extra so we would be heading for more than a 3&deg;C rise.  In a way, that encapsulates the new form of climate denialism which is dominant throughout many of the world's governments, which is to accept the science and say it is clear that human-generated climate change is having a huge impact, to say we need to do what we need to do, and then simply to fail to do it, because doing so would mean taking on, in this case, big oil.

Obviously, they can be provided by different providers but it is that people throughout rural Ireland would have regular access to such transport alternatives.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right in saying that young people, in particular, should be helped both with the provision of frequent bus services and with the cost of that.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that cost is a barrier to young people availing of public transport.  The recent budget decision in respect of 19 to 24-year-olds is a very positive development, and that is something the Government wants to build on.  The Deputy is correct that I am familiar with west Cork but there are Deputies present from different parts of the world.

More broadly, the Government has significantly increased funding to biodiversity in the last two budgets and also to organisations, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to get a stronger focus in terms of our biodiversity agenda, the national pollinator plan and so on.  We are very anxious in this regard.  The carbon tax funds give us opportunities to fund quite a range of biodiversity programmes, in particular in terms of environmentally-friendly farming.

T&aacute; agenda cuimsitheach ann a chl&uacute;d&oacute;idh Covid, c&uacute;rsa&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta agus go h&aacute;irithe, r&oacute;l na hEorpa i gcomhth&eacute;acs c&uacute;rsa&iacute; polait&iacute;ochta an domhain agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; tr&aacute;d&aacute;la.  Beidh sin faoi chaibidil againn agus mar aon leis sin t&aacute; cruinnithe a bhaineann leis an Eoraip le teacht.<\/p>  <p>  At this week's meeting we will have a very full agenda, touching on very many important issues facing the Union.  We will discuss Covid-19, with a particular focus on vaccination rates across the European Union, including in the context of rising infection rates in some member states, and tackling disinformation regarding the pandemic.  We will also discuss the global roll-out of vaccines and the central role of the World Health Organization in global health governance.<\/p>  <p>  We will discuss energy prices and what we can do individually as member states and collectively, as the European Union, to mitigate the impact of recent price fluctuations on vulnerable citizens and businesses, and to consider medium and long-term measures to increase the European Union's energy resilience and green transition.<\/p>  <p>  We will discuss digital issues, including ongoing progress on the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, and the publication of a European chips Act planned by the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  We will discuss trade, including its coherence with the overall international perspective of the European Union, and, critically, the importance of trade to global economic recovery.<\/p>  <p>  We will discuss migration, focusing on its external aspects, including our co-operation and support for countries of origin and transit as well as the serious humanitarian situation at a number of European Union borders, including those member states bordering Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  We will consider a number of upcoming summits, including COP15 and COP26, the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, summit, which will be held virtually on 25 and 26 November, and the EU-Eastern Partnership summit to be held in Brussels on 15 December.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will provide more detail on the external relations issues on this week's European Council agenda in his concluding remarks this afternoon.  I will address all other agenda items.<\/p>  <p>  Before I turn to address those agenda items for this week's meeting, I take the opportunity to update the House on a recent informal meeting of members of the European Council, which I attended on 5 October, hosted by Slovenia as part of its Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The meeting was an opportunity to discuss the European Union's role on the international stage and relations with key strategic partners, including the US and China.  In our discussions in Slovenia there was a general agreement that the European Union needs to leverage its economic power more effectively and strengthen its capacity to act.  It is in our shared interest that the European Union continues to be a leader in setting global standards in trade, technology, data, human rights, the environment and so much more.  We agreed also that in driving this work forward, our collective values should guide our approach.  I underlined the importance of the transatlantic relationship - the European Union and the United States share an important commitment to the global level playing field.  I also agreed with other EU leaders that the closeness of our partnership with the United States should not deter us, as the European Union, from having a distinct voice in our co-operation with China, not least on economic recovery and climate change but also in terms of asserting and promoting our values.<\/p>  <p>  I attended an EU-western Balkans summit the following day, 6 September, in Slovenia.  The summit saw the coming together of the European Union 27 leaders with the leaders or our six western Balkans partners, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo.  We met over two sessions.  In the first session, we were joined by representatives of the Regional Co-operation Council, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank and the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli.  The focus in this session was on the European Union as the primary driver of sustainable economic recovery and growth in the western Balkans.<\/p>  <p>  The second session was a discussion among leaders only where we reflected on the broader question of the strength of the commitment on both sides to an EU path for the western Balkans countries.  A joint statement was agreed at the summit, which reaffirmed the European Union's support for the enlargement process, while also referring to the EU's capacity to integrate new members.  I met bilaterally with my counterparts from Albania and North Macedonia, Prime Minister Edi Rama and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, respectively, in the margins of the summit.  I expressed to them my full support for their EU path.  EU membership has transformed our country.  I assured them that I would like to see the same opportunity afforded to their people.  While clearly frustrated at the slow pace of progress and ongoing political obstacles to advancing the accession process, both leaders were appreciative of Ireland's support.<\/p>  <p>  When I meet European Union leaders at this week's European Council, we will, as we have throughout the pandemic, discuss Covid-19.  This week our focus will be on vaccination rates across the European Union, including tackling disinformation and efforts to overcome vaccine hesitancy.  We will also discuss further co-ordination on free movement and travel, preparedness for future health emergencies, the global roll-out of vaccines and European Union support for the World Health Organization.<\/p>  <p>  Very significant progress has been made in tackling the pandemic, with safe and effective vaccines providing us with the means to protect ourselves from Covid-19.  However, as rising infection rates in a number of member states remind us, we must remain vigilant against this deadly disease which continues to circulate in our communities.  The decision of the European Union and its member states to join together to support the development and procurement of vaccines was the right one and has been remarkably successful.  Well over 800 million doses have already been delivered across the European Union.  I take this opportunity again to thank the people of this country who have responded so positively and played their part so commendably in tackling Covid, including through achieving such a high vaccination rate.<\/p>  <p>  At the European Council this week, we will also discuss our approach to vaccine booster doses and vaccine sharing.  The discussion will also include preparedness for and response to future health emergencies in the European Union.  The pandemic is a global challenge and we will discuss how we must work together, including beyond European Union borders, to overcome it.  The European Union is the largest exporter of Covid-19 vaccines to the world and we will need to continue our efforts to increase global vaccine production capacity and supply in order to meet global needs.<\/p>  <p>  This week's meeting will also take stock of progress on Europe's digital transformation.  When we met in March, leaders set important political orientations for the ambitious legislative agenda being advanced by President von der Leyen to \"make Europe fit for the digital age\".  The House will recall my view that setting the right strategic orientations for positive digital transformation must be seen as an essential basis for the European Union's future dynamism and strength.  This means continuing to strike the right balance - shaping Europe's future in a direction that remains open, competitive and innovation-friendly.  We need to set the high levels of ambition necessary for skills development, digital connectivity and responsive public services.  We must work to unlock the full potential of our Single Market, including in services, while recognising that digitalisation is itself making traditional distinctions between goods and services less relevant.  We must make it as easy as possible for our SMEs to scale their businesses across Europe's borders and beyond.  It is also important to provide strong new protections against illegal and harmful digital content, including robust new institutional arrangements to promote digital safety, oversee efficient and effective take-down procedures, and ensure strong remedial measures for non-compliance.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union is leading the development of global standards for fast-evolving applications in the field of artificial intelligence, working closely with like-minded global partners to ensure the strongest possible underpinnings of integrity and trust.  The reality is that data-driven innovation is the key source of productivity growth in today's advanced economies, while also equipping us with exciting new capabilities to improve the collective performance of our public sectors, support higher living standards and strengthen human welfare more generally.  We will also discuss further strengthening our collective capabilities and toolboxes in responding effectively to growing cyber threats, including to democratic values.  I also welcome the recent establishment of the Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council as a significant initiative to enhance transatlantic dialogue on the basis of a substantive economic agenda.<\/p> <p> We will also have a timely discussion on energy prices as we look ahead to the winter months.  Higher demand as the global economy recovers and tighter gas supply have contributed to sharp rises in energy prices.  This issue has given rise to widespread concern in Ireland and across the EU.  I am acutely aware of the impacts of significant energy price rises on citizens, particularly the most vulnerable in society.  Last week, the European Commission published a communication on energy prices, which is an important contribution to our discussions this week.  This includes a toolbox of measures that the EU and its member states can use to address the immediate impact of current price increases and to strengthen resilience against future shocks.<\/p> <p> In the short term member states are best placed to support their citizens.  In last week's budget we introduced a range of measures to support households through higher welfare payments to increase and expand the scope of the fuel allowance and to improve energy efficiency.  Over the medium term, the European Commission has suggested examining a number of measures at EU level, including additional energy storage capacity, reviewing electricity market design and voluntary joint procurement of gas stocks.  Energy ministers will meet next week to progress further work on this issue.  Ultimately, increasing our supply of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency are the best ways to ensure security of supply, tackle energy poverty and protect people from the impact of high energy costs.<\/p> <p> EU leaders will also discuss our collective approach to COP26 in Glasgow in November and will call for an ambitious global response to climate change.  The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in August, was a hugely important statement on international science's understanding of the climate system and climate change.  Translating science and urgency into policy and action is one of the most important challenges we face.  The EU has taken a strong position and will lead by example.<\/p> <p> The European Council will assess the implementation to date of the June 2021 European Council conclusions, which focused on progressing the external aspects of EU migration policy and intensifying work on co-operation with key third countries of origin and transit.  It will also discuss financing for Syrian refugees and host communities in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and other parts of the region.  The instrumentalisation of migrants at the EU's external borders for political purposes and the humanitarian consequences of that action is of particular concern.  This practice, which has developed of late, is reprehensible.<\/p> <p> We will have a discussion on trade, and in particular a strategic reflection following on from last week's discussions in Slovenia, on the international role of the EU.  I will be supporting an open approach underpinned by an international rules-based order.<\/p> <p> I take the opportunity to update the House on my attendance at the Malm&ouml; International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism last week.  This conference is a reminder that no effort should be spared in fighting all forms of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia.  Old prejudices and hatreds are being reanimated through new technologies and platforms.  We have to learn and empower ourselves to tackle hate both offline and online.  This will be among the issues I will raise when I meet other EU leaders in Brussels this week.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the opportunity this week to engage collectively and bilaterally with my EU counterparts on a broad range of pressing issues.  In advance of the formal meeting, I will informally meet leaders from the six Nordic and Baltic EU member states, a group with which Ireland shares many policy priorities.  I will report to the House on our discussions next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000033#FF00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634736120,"counter":372,"content":"<p>EU leaders are meeting this week at another crucial period for the protocol.  It has never been more important that the North has a voice in Europe.  On Monday, Assembly Members in the North backed a motion calling for direct dialogue between the Assembly and the European Parliament.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently raised the need for continued representation of the North at an EU level throughout the sorry saga of Brexit and the negotiation process. The people of the North must not be silenced by Brexit; their voices must be heard.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will not need me to remind him that the people of the North voted to reject Brexit and remain in the EU, but were dragged out by the British Government against their will.  As a result of that, the protocol was necessary to protect communities in the North.  It protects the Good Friday Agreement, protects our all-island economy and prevents a border on our island.  The protocol has been in place for several months and while there have been issues to iron out, businesses and communities are keen to find workable and practical solutions.  Despite the loud rhetoric of a small minority within political unionism, there is majority support among the public, political parties and Assembly Members for the protocol.  Many businesses are finding that the protocol provides considerable opportunities for them as their unique position gives them access to British and EU markets.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach will know, last week the Vice-President of the European Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d, announced a series of proposals to address issues around the protocol and deliver practical, workable solutions for businesses.  My colleagues and I have engaged extensively with Vice-President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d on the protocol and left him in no doubt about the support there is in the North and across Ireland for the protocol.  It is time for political leaders to engage with these proposals seriously.  Political grandstanding and rhetoric help no one and solve nothing.  I dearly hope our colleagues within political unionism will respond to these proposals with the same commitment to finding solutions that we have shown.<\/p>  <p>  As we are at this vital stage, I ask the Taoiseach to make clear to our European colleagues the depth and strength of support within the North for the protocol.  Will the Taoiseach make clear to EU leaders the expressed views of MLAs on the need for direct dialogue between the Assembly and the European Parliament?  Will he ensure that the people of the North have a voice in Europe and that their voice is heard loud and strong?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach cannot be in any doubt about the cost of the energy crisis which is hitting ordinary workers and families.  Prices are spiralling and becoming unaffordable for many on ordinary incomes.  We must tackle this cost-of-living crisis and ensure ordinary people get a break from their sky-high energy bills.  Earlier this month, European finance ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss this crisis.  That meeting was chaired by the Taoiseach's Government colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Despite this, we have heard nothing from the Minister about what solutions were discussed at the meeting and what this Government will do domestically and at European level to meet this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  We know that solutions are there if the will is there.  Spain, for example, is cutting VAT on electricity and targeting &euro;2.6 billion in excess profits from utilities that have benefited from the rising gas and electricity prices.  France is blocking further gas and electricity price hikes until the spring and has also increased energy vouchers for the lowest income households.  Italy has allocated &euro;3 billion to cancel system costs on household bills and allocate more for social supports.  I could go on.  Meanwhile, here in Ireland little has been done to protect our citizens from the crippling cost of energy price hikes.  That is not good enough.  The Government has failed to tackle the cost of the energy crisis with the urgency it deserves.  I am asking the Taoiseach if he will work urgently with European leaders to tackle energy price hikes and ensure Irish citizens get the break they need from these spiralling costs.  Will he prioritise this at the European Council and ensure the issue of energy prices gets the attention it deserves?<\/p>  <p>  At the European Council we also have a vital opportunity to stand up for our fishing communities and ensure fishermen get a fair deal.  Government after Government has failed our fishing communities and this Government has sadly become no exception.  Last week, the report of the seafood task force released by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was yet another blow for Irish fishermen.  It acknowledged the Government&rsquo;s failure to stand up and defend Irish fisheries during the Brexit negotiations and subsequent trade deal with Britain.  It is proposed to decommission 60 vessels from an already reduced Irish fishing fleet.<\/p> <p>While temporary cessation and voluntary permanent decommissioning may suit a small number of people in the fishing industry, for the majority, these proposals are another body blow to an industry that is fighting for its survival.<\/p> <p> Where is the commitment to seek full reform of the Common Fisheries Policy?  Where is the commitment to seek fair and equal burden sharing, new quota and new opportunities?  I am urging the Taoiseach once again to stand up for Irish fishermen and deliver full reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to meet our fishing communities' needs and protect their livelihoods.  We have been here many times before.  Fishers do not need vague promises or more lofty rhetoric from the Taoiseach or anyone else.  He must take their fight to the heart of Europe and fight for fairness for Irish fishermen.  Will he fight for our fishing communities at the European Council?  That is the challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000034#GG00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634736720,"counter":374,"content":"<p>If we reduce the mood, attitude and atmosphere surrounding the relationship between the EU and the British Government to a phrase that could capture the situation in which we find ourselves, \"perfidious Albion\" resounds.  Despite continuing attempts by EU negotiators to lower the political temperature, take British demands seriously and focus the British on working on the technical aspects of the negotiations, the British never had any intention of standing by their word according to Dominic Cummings, formerly a senior figure in Downing Street.  Apparently, the British Government's intention from the outset was to abandon the protocol.  We are continually forced to contend with a blatant and obtuse approach by the British, one that is hell-bent on ensuring that they remain locked in perpetual dispute with the EU and designed to distract from the impact of Brexit on Britain itself rather than searching for a meaningful solution.  The EU has displayed a maturity, a commitment to political consensus and a resolve to find solutions to previously intractable problems throughout the process, but it is repeatedly met with unreasonable and ill-thought-out demands accompanied by displays of the worst kind of nationalist jingoism from British politicians and commentators.<\/p>  <p>  While I am sure that there are many in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU who do not quite know how to respond to the British claims that the EU has surrendered in the sausage wars, the key overriding concern for every public representative - indeed, for every right-thinking person on this island - remains the continued protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  The way the British are behaving is, at best, irresponsible.  They cannot and must not be allowed to play domestic politics with the most important political development on this island in a century.  The Good Friday Agreement must be offered every possible protection by the EU.  What has Brexit achieved for the British?  There are empty shelves, empty petrol tanks and staffing shortages across all areas of industry, yet the British Government's response is to continue insisting on playing poker with the peace process.  It is contributing to the stoking of community tensions among unionists over the protocol, all of which is designed to distract British voters from the mess that it has made of Brexit.  I add my voice to that of my colleague, Deputy McDonald, in asking that the Taoiseach communicate with our EU colleagues the depth and strength of support in the North for the protocol.<\/p>  <p>  Poland has endured a difficult past of invasion, occupation, betrayal and economic deprivation.  Emerging from such a past, there is an onus on Poland, like Ireland, to stand as a champion for liberal democratic values, values for which Polish citizens made clear their support when taking to the streets in their hundreds of thousands in recent weeks in support of Polish membership of the EU.  There are serious concerns with the extreme right-wing Polish Government and the direction it is taking its people.  There is an onus on the EU and the Taoiseach to raise these concerns about what is happening in Poland and other countries, such as Hungary, at the next meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000035#HH00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1634736720,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday and the key issues on the agenda are Covid-19, digital transformation, energy prices, migration and external relations.  However, the issue that will dominate coverage is the growing split with Poland and the long-term impact that this will have.  There is a dark cloud over the EU.  Poland continues to take a confrontational approach to the rule of law and the interpretation of EU law, openly flouting rulings of the European Court of Justice.  The latest escalation stems from a court ruling in Warsaw that declared that parts of EU law were not compatible with the Polish constitution.  This comes after the Polish Government diluted the independence of its judiciary by taking greater control of the appointment process and making attempts to purge its Supreme Court by lowering the retirement age.  It also introduced a disciplinary regime that allows judges to be punished for their rulings.  This was targeted at those who criticised much-needed reforms.<\/p>  <p>  The Polish Government's approach strikes at the heart of the treaties that underpin the EU.  It is a challenge that must be dealt with.  The ongoing row was escalated further yesterday by the Polish Prime Minister when he made an incendiary speech to the European Parliament that was clearly targeted at his home audience.  The insistence of the Prime Minister, Mr. Mateusz Morawiecki, that the Polish constitution supersedes EU law has put the Polish Government on a collision course.  It continues to stoke tensions by accusing the Commission of blackmail while it dismantles democratic checks and balances at home.  The Polish Opposition is warning that this is putting Poland on track for an EU exit.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot have a situation where a country is directly targeting the independence of its judiciary and media by ignoring EU law without us taking effective action.  The Commission is responding by holding back Covid stimulus funds, but this plays directly into the hands of the right-wing Polish Government by allowing it to set up a David versus Goliath narrative.  Some member states also want the Commission to start a conditionality mechanism to withhold other EU Cohesion Funds, which would cost Poland billions of euro.  A legal challenge to the Polish court ruling is also possible.  Any action to strip Poland of membership rights under Article 7, which would be the nuclear option, would require the support of all states.  We know that Hungary, which is also controlled by a right-wing government, will likely veto that.  In Hungary, we have recently seen the targeting of the LGBTI+ community.<\/p>  <p>  At the Council, the Taoiseach must outline Ireland's position clearly.  Where does Ireland stand and what will we do about this?  Our judges have stood in solidarity against what has happened to Poland's judiciary by joining a silent protest in Warsaw in January 2020.  Our Government must also do so.  There is an option under the treaties for a country to take another to court.  Will Ireland continue to sit idly by while the foundations of the EU are challenged?  A country can sue Poland at the European Court of Justice over damage being done to the rule of law and the European legal order.  It would be political and risky, but also a clear signal of intent that what Poland was doing does not just damage the EU, but also fellow member states.  The Taoiseach might indicate whether this option is under consideration or what action Ireland might take.<\/p>  <p>  The past month has seen dramatic changes in some governments across Europe that may derail efforts to take effective action.  The former Chancellor of Austria, Mr. Sebastian Kurz, resigned over an allegation that public funds were used to fund his rise to power through the purchase of adverts in favourable newspapers.  Germany went to the polls, heralding a dramatic change in direction, with our sister party, the German Social Democratic Party, winning the election and on track to form a coalition with Alliance 90\/The Greens and liberals.  This could be Chancellor Merkel's last Council meeting, but we look forward to Mr. Olaf Scholz replacing her.<\/p>  <p>  In the time remaining to me, I will touch on two issues.  First, COP26 is on the agenda, as are energy prices.  The Greek Government has objected to the EU's carbon reduction plans, as it believes that the goals for maritime transport under the Fit for 55 proposals are not realistic.  Shipping is to join the emissions trading system over a three-year period from 2023.  This is an issue for Greece, which accounts for over half of the EU merchant fleet.  Will the Taoiseach outline whether Ireland has also raised objections to the Fit for 55 proposals?<\/p>  <p>  Second, the Stability and Growth Pact is not directly on the agenda of the Council but will no doubt be discussed.  A review of and consultation on the pact are under way.  The pact contains the budgetary rules that determine the fiscal capacity of our State.  This is an issue that the Labour Party has sought action on since 2016 when it became clear that Ireland needed to ramp up capital investment in housing and climate action but was restricted in doing so by the borrowing rules.  We also had the ridiculous situation of Ireland borrowing at near-zero interest rates and, when selling off our stake in AIB, using that to pay down debt.<\/p> <p>The rules were correctly suspended during the pandemic to facilitate borrowing to save our economy and to cover increased health and social protection costs.  As has been stated many times, the rules, as they stand, are too rigid, opaque and complex.  They have stopped us from making investments.  It is clear that productive capital investments need to be addressed in the pact, in particular investments that we will need to make for a just transition and a zero carbon society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000035#HH00300","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634737320,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication last week by the European Commission of the package of proposals on the Northern Ireland protocol.  Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d has taken a huge interest in this issue.  He has consulted widely and listened to the concerns of businesses, stakeholders and individuals on the ground in Northern Ireland and he has done everything possible to address the challenges.  We now need serious constructive engagement by the UK with the European Union, through the established mechanisms, to resolve these problems.  Practical and pragmatic solutions can be arrived at in regard to the movement of goods and medicines, customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, provisions.  In addition, there will be greater participation by politicians in Northern Ireland, and by civil servants and civic society generally, in this ongoing process.<\/p>  <p>  We need to remind ourselves of the rationale for the protocol, that is, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market.  I hope that the UK will engage constructively.  The remarks by David Frost concerning the European Court of Justice in this context are a bit of a red herring.  It is a theoretical issue of no practical consequence for the day-to-day problems being encountered on the ground in Northern Ireland.  As an arbitration in this regard is unlikely to arise in practice, all concerned now need to get on with it.<\/p>  <p>  Like others, I would like to comment on the rule of law issues, with particular reference to Poland.  As we know, Poland's constitutional court has rejected the supremacy of EU law.  Questions arise as to whether the ruling Law and Justice party actually subscribes to European values and democratic norms, having regard to issues such as media freedom, an independent judiciary and the treatment of the LGBT community.  The question is how should Europe react to these developments.  Article 7 proceedings have commenced but at the end of the day, sanctions arising from this process must be agreed by the General Affairs Council and, ultimately, by unanimity at the European Council, which is unlikely.  Funding, including recovery and resilience funding, can be withheld.  The European Court of Justice is due to issue a ruling next month on the conditionality regulation.  We await the outcome of that.  This issue is probably best tackled by way of dialogue and moral pressure brought to bear on Polish politicians and society generally.  All of us have a role to play in that regard.  It is in nobody's interest for Poland to leave the European Union.  Hopefully, these issues can be resolved and it will not come to that.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to address the issue of the so-called strategic compass, which is to be outlined in November by the European Commission and will point a pathway for European security and defence capabilities.  According to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, it will define policy orientations and specific goals and objectives in four clusters, namely, crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships.  As I mentioned in the House yesterday, this initiative should be seen in the context of recent events, including the cyberattack on the HSE, recent events in Afghanistan, the hijacking of a Ryanair flight in Belarus and the AUKUS decision on nuclear submarines involving France, the UK and the US.  Yesterday, in this House, the Taoiseach outlined to me Ireland's defence policy in an international context.  I agree with what he stated in that regard.  We need to be cautious about France's call for a greater self-reliance but we also need to be conscious of these recent developments; these new threats so to speak.  Ireland is not neutral when it comes to terrorism, extremism or cyberattacks.  We await the publication of the strategic compass proposal and look forward to a comprehensive debate on it in this House in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000036#JJ00200","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1634737320,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for the very detailed report ahead of what I have no doubt will be an extremely busy couple of days at the European Council meeting.  I am grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for his engagement this morning with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  Many contributors to the debate have spoken about the rule of law.  There is a collective opinion in this House that the situation in Poland simply is not tolerable.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, in particular for his strong comments on the margins of the General Affairs Council, which reflect the opinion of the wider House and not just the governing parties.<\/p>  <p>  As set out by the Taoiseach, the agenda comprises many important issues.  Deputies from across the House have touched on many of those issues or on specific issues.  I would like to refer to one specific element, that is, trade, which the Taoiseach referenced in his address today and spoke about last week in terms of Europe and the wider world at the meeting in Slovenia.  There are three areas we need to look at.  All of them are related to the fateful decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  Ireland is a small export-based country, with an economic region that goes beyond our nearest neighbours.  On trade within the European Union and within the Single Market, that is, access to the world's largest global bloc, it is important that we continue to support indigenous companies through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to work with partners within the Single Market to have more Irish products going not only to Germany and France, but much further afield into Bulgaria, Romania and many other countries.  There are huge opportunities for Ireland to not only insulate from the true impact of Brexit but to grow our economy and continue to move way from our dependence on our nearest neighbours.  That is tied to our trading relationship not just within the Single Market but beyond it with third party countries through a plethora of European trade deals.  It is vital that Ireland leads and shows example in a European context and that we swiftly ratify the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, in this House now that it has completed the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs process.  We must also continue to work with European partners on European-based trade deals that are good for the Irish economy and good for the wider global economy, as well as our responsibilities to the climate emergency.  We need to bear in mind the draft deal with the Mercosur region in that context.  <\/p>  <p>  The most important trade deal at the moment is the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, between the EU and UK post Brexit.  I welcome the decision this week by the European Parliament to appoint Irish MEPs such as Barry Andrews and Se&aacute;n Kelly, who is from my own political family, to the new EU-UK body.  It is crucial that there is constant engagement between parliamentarians, be it through the European Council or the British-Irish Parliamentary Association, as well as between the European Commission and the United Kingdom Government.  As stated by many other Deputies thus far in the debate, there are huge concerns in regard to the British Government being a trustworthy partner to the European Union and, specifically, to Ireland.  Those concerns are held by every person on this island.  There is a massive economic and societal impact of the actions that are being taken at the moment in Whitehall, for whatever reason.  Once again, Ireland finds itself in the middle in a European context in terms of playing the most important role when it comes to the Brexit discussion to ensure that the very generous offer made last week by the European Commission, through Commissioner &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d, is genuinely followed up.  I appreciate that huge sacrifices and comprises were made within the European Union, between member states and between various Directorates General of the European Commission.  That should not be lost on our friends in the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  As others have referred to, the introduction to the talks at this late stage of the competence of the European Court of Justice is absolutely a red herring.  It flies in the face of, as I mentioned earlier, so many other trade deals in which the European Commission has engaged with other third party countries and which the United Kingdom was happy to sign up to when part of the European Union or as it rolled over trade deals with other countries.  That is what is at stake in a trading capacity.  I fundamentally believe that a trading relationship that can salvage something from the post-Brexit fall-out has to be one based on good faith and trust.  The implementation of the protocol is crucially important to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000036#JJ00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1634737320,"counter":379,"content":"<p>It is a pity the Taoiseach is leaving the Chamber right now.  He might take the opportunity to go out and meet the children who have been waiting for him for the past hour and a half.  I am disappointed I did not get the chance to make the following statement before the Taoiseach left the Chamber.  The Taoiseach alleged that he was not invited to meet protesters.  He was sent an email, as were other Ministers.  The Taoiseach clearly was invited but he chose not to attend.  Hopefully, when he gets a chance, he will correct the record in that regard.<\/p> <p>He might even take the chance now as he leaves.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, usually takes these statements and in fairness, it is usually him who receives the comments.  That is why I was surprised to see the Taoiseach stay so long today rather than go out and meet the children at the front of these buildings, which I would say, according to anybody listening in to these debates across the country, was his top priority and responsibility today.<\/p> <p> On the challenges the Government faces, my colleague and party leader, Deputy McDonald, has referenced fisheries.  There is a seething anger across fishing and coastal communities at the ongoing failure to ensure there will be burden-sharing of the quota loss that arises from the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement.  As the Minister of State is aware, in some cases, especially with mackerel, there is a huge loss of quota that has a devastating impact.  That is why the Government is suggesting 60 more vessels will have to be decommissioned.  It is because of the failure of Government after Government to secure a fair share of the fish in our own waters.  The Government has not secured burden-sharing despite repeated assurances it would seek it.  The EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries was in Ireland recently.  When the question was put to him, it was clear we had not put any pressure on him to agree to burden-sharing of the quota loss that would have prevented the need to decommission these 60 vessels.<\/p> <p> Right now, Irish fishermen around our coast can only attain 15% of the fish in our waters under the Common Fisheries Policy.  If that was not bad enough, we now have an additional hit from that trade agreement.  This is ongoing.  We are the laughing stock of Europe.  When we talk to MEPs and senior politicians in Europe privately, they cannot believe we allow this situation to continue.  It is a profound injustice.  We talk about all the legislation we are bringing in around the marine at the moment, the immense resource it is and the potential for coastal communities.  What has more potential than the fish in our own waters?  We have a situation where on the south coast, our boats are tied up while day after day, Spanish, French and Belgian boats land fish at our harbours, with no checks from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency, SFPA, to be exported back to their own country.  There is no value, no checks and no equality for the fishermen there.  I am asking for the Minister of State, along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to get some fire in their bellies and stand up and fight for Irish fishermen.  That is their challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000036#JJ00400","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634737920,"counter":381,"content":"<p>It was indeed a very comprehensive opening statement from the Taoiseach.  It was nine pages long.  The most eye-catching part of it was what was missing, namely, any mention of Poland.  I accept the Government parties have referenced it but it was not in the statement.  One of the most important aspects of the EU, its cohesion and its values will concern the issue of Poland.  We need to put that front and centre in our statements and I was surprised it was not.  When we talk about what has just occurred in Poland, and the Polish challenge to the supremacy of EU law, we should put words to what that actually means, that is, what it means for genuine Polish people on the ground.  I am also conscious that in my constituency of Dublin Central, and in all our constituencies around the country, we represent people who came here from Poland, who have contributed massively to our country and who are very conscious of what is happening in their homeland.  We represent them and they want us to be advocating for them.<\/p>  <p>  I will detail what the reality is on the ground in Poland at the minute.  We are approaching the one-year anniversary of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal decision, which essentially banned legal abortions.  It led to the largest public protests in Poland for decades, which were led by women and human rights defenders.  Abortion Without Borders, which aids women in European countries where abortion is illegal or access is highly restricted, reported that 17,000 women in Poland contacted the organisation in the six months after the ruling looking for help to access an abortion.  The organisation continues to receive 800 calls a months.  The Polish Government has also undermined efforts to combat gender-based violence, including by initiating Poland's withdrawal from the landmark European convention on violence against women, the Istanbul Convention, which we ourselves were quite late in signing up to.  Last August, a 2019 study commissioned by the government, which was not made available to the public but was leaked to the press, found 63% of Polish women had experienced domestic violence during their lives.  The Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, GREVIO, highlighted the need for Poland to change the definition of rape from a forced-based definition to one covering all non-consensual sexual acts.<\/p>  <p>  The suppression of the LGBTQI+ community in Poland is something that has raised eyebrows but needs substantial action.  While the highly controversial LGBT-free zones in 100 Polish towns have been defended as largely symbolic and unenforceable, how does that make them any less significant to members of the LGBTQI+ community in those towns?  Earlier this year, the regional assembly of Swietokrzyskie became the first region to abandon the declaration of an LGBT-free town on foot of threats of losing its EU funding.  This shows the importance of what we can do as EU members.  According to the ILGA-Europe 2021 report, the status of LGBTQI+ rights in Poland is the worst among EU countries.<\/p>  <p>  We have recourse to action.  It is important we discuss all three options when we go to the European Council meeting.  Option 1 is infringement, which is being discussed.  This involves the Commission legally challenging the Polish court's judgment and this could, and hopefully will, lead to fines.  Option 2 concerns conditionality of funds.  Poland received &euro;23.9 billion in grants and &euro;12.1 billion in cheap loans it has applied for as part of the EU's recovery fund.  The Irish people are, proudly in my view, net payers to the European Union project, having benefited massively when we joined.  I do not think we want to see taxpayers here and in the rest of Europe paying for LGBTQI+ exclusion zones and the suppression of fundamental rights.  Option 3 is the application of Article 7 of the EU Treaty.  It states the rights of member states, including the right to vote on EU decisions, can be suspended.  I am conscious that when we joined in 1973, and right up to recently, Ireland ways in many ways a conservative country.  I am also conscious we changed our own Constitution in 1972 to remove the special place of the Catholic Church in advance of our own membership.<\/p>  <p>  A union based on peace cannot only be about peace when it comes to conflict on a macro scale.  It must be peace when it comes to how people live within that union.  It is absolutely fundamental that peace is extended to women, minority groups and LGBTQI+ people.  When we go there this week, we should go there with the message we will not accept anything less because to be part of a union is to recognise we stand not only for Irish people but for Polish people or for any person in the European Union.  That must be what we go there with the intention of doing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000037#KK00200","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1634737920,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I dtosach b&aacute;ire, mar gurb &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad deis at&aacute; agam, ba mhaith liom n&oacute;im&eacute;ad a th&oacute;g&aacute;il chun cuimhneamh ar bheirt d&aacute;r m&oacute;rfhil&iacute; a chailleamar le c&uacute;pla l&aacute; anuas &ndash; Brendan Kennelly agus M&aacute;ire Mhac an tSaoi.

The second law of thermodynamics might not be an obvious jumping-off point for statements such as this but I am worried about the future of the European Union because, as Deputy Gannon and Deputy Duncan Smith said, the European Union is a conscious and continuous act of creation we have all entered into as European citizens.  We have done that in the memory and the consciousness of the conflicts that gave rise to the European Union.  It is the great peace project of our time.  However, unless we stand by those values, and as Deputy Gannon said, we do so not just on the macro level but on that micro level between communities and minorities, then we are not living true to the values that hold the European Union together.  We cannot take it as a given that things do stay together, because entropy increases.<\/p> <p>Things will tend to fall apart unless we participate actively in the conscious act of creation and live out those values.  We have heard a clear message from the Polish Government in terms of its reaction to the EU's response to the disciplinary chamber of the Polish Supreme Court.  We know that the EU is critical in terms of its annual rule of law report and it was predictable that Hungary would row in behind the Polish Government in this regard.  However, we have also heard from the Polish people, as Deputy Gannon said, both here in Ireland and in Poland.

Would that we were able to say that Covid is in the rear-view mirror in this country but unfortunately, it has caught up with us again.  In a worldwide context, we are moving inexorably towards 5 million lives lost to Covid.  In Africa, less than 5% of people have been fully vaccinated while we move towards 90% and beyond of our adult population.  The letter argues that the global crisis of vaccine inequity is evident and is not only morally unacceptable but also pragmatically self-defeating if we are to bring Covid-19 under control.

In the last 12 months, the Irish Government and its counterparts in Europe have looked at the issue of supply chains in the context of making vaccines available to Europe and dispersing them throughout the EU.  This has been very successful.  Many potholes were met along the way, particularly in the early days.  We saw with both Oxford and Janssen how difficult it was at times to get supplies into the country but that has all been overcome, thankfully.  Around 93% of the adult population in Ireland is now fully vaccinated.  Who would have believed we would get there?  Bloomberg, the colossal media outlet, now recognises Ireland as a world leader in terms of tackling Covid.<\/p><p>I want the Government to go to our European colleagues again to try to fix another supply chain, namely the one related to construction.  As we know, for the past 12 or 14 months, construction prices have spiralled, with costs now 30% higher than they were pre-Covid in 2019.  Analysis of the figures show that labour costs in the period have risen by 4% but material costs, particularly steel, insulation and timber, have increased dramatically.  Timber is something that we can largely supply ourselves but products like steel and insulation come from further afield.  The construction materials deficit is being felt in every country west of the Ural mountains and in North America.  I cannot understand why there has not been an EU-wide approach to this.  If the bloc of member states was able to fix the vaccine and medicine supply chains collectively, why are we not tackling the construction materials supply chain deficiencies as a bloc too?  I hope the Taoiseach and Ministers can raise this with their counterparts in Europe at the European Council meeting and external to it.  It is very important that such a dialogue would happen and would deepen.  I believe it can be fixed.<\/p><p>I will conclude by referencing Poland.  I have many Polish friends and neighbours.  I also did a block of Erasmus study when I was in college in a small Czech Republic town near the Polish border.  It was a fabulous place.  I was there in 2002, a couple of years before Poland acceded to the EU and there was huge excitement about what the EU would bring in terms of economics and also in terms of the value set that the EU has stood for over many decades.  The erosion of LGBT rights that we have seen in Poland in recent months is really regrettable.  Poland is now in violation of EU discrimination laws.<\/p><p>On a separate issue, Poland is not fully playing its part as far as Covid digital certification is concerned.  One of my constituents in Clare got his first vaccine in Ireland.  He asked the HSE if it would be possible to get his second jab in Poland as he was relocating there.  The HSE said it would be no problem because Covid digital certification policy, which is EU-wide, allows for that.  He now does not have a digital certificate because Poland has decided, despite his best efforts, that all agreements that are in place in terms of certification do not apply in Poland.  Polish authorities will not certify that he is fully vaccinated so all of the privileges and freedoms available to those who are certified are being denied to him.  I ask the Minister of State to engage with his Polish counterpart on this matter.  Poland is either a part of the Covid digital certificate system or it is not.  If it is part of the system, then it needs to sign off on people, whether they are Irish or from other EU countries, who had their first vaccine dose in their home country and their second dose in Poland.  That is what Poland signed up to and it needs to start issuing these certificates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000038#LL00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1634738520,"counter":387,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that we are not beyond the Covid pandemic yet and are still dealing with something that is incredibly serious and dangerous.  That needs to be top of the agenda at the European Council.  It goes without saying that the conversation on vaccines must include a discussion on booster shots.  That is absolutely necessary and everyone here would be very supportive of that.  That said, I add my voice to those who have said that we need to get to grips with the fact that none of us is safe until all of us are safe.  We must put a plan in place to ensure the plentiful supply of cheap vaccines to the developing world although I do accept that there are significant logistical difficulties.  Some have said that the TRIPS waiver is a misnomer and arguments have been made for the protection of pharmaceutical companies in the context of research and development, although I would not always be open to listening to them.  The fact is that we need a solution.  Pharmaceutical companies are part of the world and they need to be part of the solution.  The European Council, the Commission and the EU also needs to be part of a solution.  I am not worried what it looks like.  I am not worried whether we call it the TRIPS waiver or we engage the waiver, as long as we come up with a solution that delivers.  That is what needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  I also agree with what many have said in relation to the situation in Poland and the absolutely brutal breaches of the rule of law.  I understand that the EU is putting leverage mechanisms in place.  There are certain questions that are before the European Court of Justice at the moment and we need them to be progressed as soon as possible.  Obviously it would be better to deal with these issues through talking but leverage may be required and recovery and resilience funding is relevant in that regard because money talks.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying that everyone here agrees that the protocol is the only show in town.  Vice-President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and the European Commission have shown how far they are willing to move in order to deliver solutions that will make a difference, particularly for people in the North from all communities.  They are working to provide solutions for farmers and business people and officialdom has kicked in.  While there is terrible mood music coming from certain elements within unionism and from the British Government, we need to plough on with solutions.  We need to ensure that every part of the European project is aware of where we stand in relation to that and of the absolute necessity of protecting the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to deal with the wider issue of the energy crisis.

I hope the Minister of State will pass on the points I wish to make, which largely revolve around the issue of Palestine.  It is an extremely urgent matter that six Palestinian prisoners are currently on hunger strike.  Two of them, Qayed Fasfus and Mukdad Qawasmeh, have been on hunger strike for almost 100 days.  Their lives are very seriously in danger.  All of the six are on hunger strike because they have been imprisoned without trial and in many cases repeatedly denied any kind of due process.  This is a very urgent, life-threatening matter.  They, as well as their supporters and families and so on, are asking that this be raised as a matter of urgency and an appeal made to Israel to give them due process so they can come off that hunger strike, or, indeed, to release them.<\/p><p>That raises a wider issue.  The Taoiseach referred to his attendance at the Malm&ouml; International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism and I would really like to ask him some questions about that.  At the outset, I want to say that anti-Semitism is a vile phenomenon.  The Holocaust is one of the greatest crimes that was ever committed by humanity against a particular group, that is, the Jewish people.  Although it is worth saying that there were other victims of the Holocaust, such as Gypsies, communists and trade unionists, the major victims were the Jewish people in a genocidal assault by the Nazis.  We must absolutely commemorate the Holocaust and insist that it never ever happens again.  However, it is disturbing that at that conference, as is the wont of Israeli political leaders, President Herzog made the following statement: <\/p> <blockquote> \t... when criticism of a particular Israeli policy mutates into questioning Israel&rsquo;s very right to exist - this is not diplomacy, this is demonization and anti-Semitism, because Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish People.\u200b <\/blockquote>  <p>This is a very familiar refrain.  You can question this or that policy of Israel but if you question the right of what some of us happen to believe is an apartheid state to exist, you are an anti-Semite.  That is not acceptable.  We should not sign up to definitions of anti-Semitism that suggest that and we should be aware that Israel's claim to be the Jewish state representing the Jewish people is not a view shared by millions of Jews across the world.  For example, a recent study of the Jewish electorate in the United States found that 25% of Jewish electors believe Israel is an apartheid state, 22% believe it is committing genocide against the Palestinian people, 34% say that Israel's treatment of Palestinians is the same as racism in the United States, and 20% of young Jewish voters said Israel has no right to exist.  They are hardly anti-Semites.  It is appalling misuse of the terminology of anti-Semitism and is an insult to the memory of the Holocaust to try to equate those two things.<\/p><p>Israel is an apartheid racist state and I say that based on its own legal constitution, particularly around the law of return.  The law of return prioritises the rights of Jewish people to gain entry to the historic land of Israel or Palestine - whatever you call it - and denies that right to Palestinians.  That right exists under international law, UN General Assembly resolution 194, which Israel denies and has denied since its foundation, when it ethnically cleansed 1 million Palestinians.  It is a racist state in its fundamental laws.  It practises persecution of the Palestinian people and the denial of their rights on an ongoing and systematic basis.  It is entirely legitimate to say that we should not accept the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, that Palestinians have the right to return and therefore to question the existence of the Israeli state and pose the possibility of a single state where Jews, Palestinians, Christians, Arabs and people of no religion would have equality in a single state.  Not everybody agrees with that but a lot of people believe it and it is not an anti-Semitic view to hold.  We absolutely have to stand against that and I commend the author Sally Rooney for publicly declaring her support for the boycott, divestment, sanctions campaign against the apartheid regime.<\/p><p>I did not have time to raise the issue of the people's vaccine but I ask the Minister of State to pass on to the Taoiseach the request from the people's vaccine group to meet with him to discuss the waiving of the TRIPS patent restrictions on the production of Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and so on because that is seriously inhibiting the global fight against the pandemic in the developing world. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000039#MM00100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1634739120,"counter":389,"content":"<p>It is good to have an opportunity to speak on this particular conference.  A number of things come to mind that we need to comment on at this particular time.  Needless to say, I do not go the way of the previous speaker.  I would recommend Leon Uris's book on the subject, which entails a fairly broad description of the founding of Israel and what it is today.  I do not agree with many of the things Israel has done - I totally disagree with them - but we need to be very careful not to pander on the side of suggesting that there may be a reason to level the scores in some way or fashion.  We need to be cautious about that because it is a dangerous place to go.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister of State for their work in attending to their duties in the European context.  On the Northern Ireland protocol, it is sad that we find ourselves at a juncture where the European Union has gone out of its way to accommodate the concerns expressed by our friends across the water in the UK.  It appears that they will not accept it no matter what happens.  A crucial issue is the failure to accept the European court's primacy in areas of dispute.  What is the alternative to that?  Do we set up a whole new courts system that will be in accordance with what our UK friends want, or do we assume that the UK in future will not adhere to any agreement it has entered into and cannot be relied upon to carry out and observe what it has signed?  There are many people who believe that that was always UK policy.  There is some foundation to that and, unfortunately, it has been confirmed in recent times.  My humble submission is that times have changed.  That is the case right across Europe with regard to Poland, Hungary and all the other countries as well.  Times are not the same as they were.  We must not forget that we transferred from what was essentially a set of communist countries on the one side, and previous to that they transitioned from imperial states that had no regard for democracy at all.<\/p>  <p>  There has to be a coming together of minds on this issue.  There has to be some recognition of a level playing field whereby the European Union stands for fairness, democracy and benign authority.  The benign bit is the important aspect of that.  That does not mean that we should not question things.  We have to ensure that the European Union is at all times in accord with the wishes of the people within it.  I had occasion last evening to mention the money laundering legislation, which creates some problems for a lot of people.  It creates problems for us in this country.  I mentioned this already on the Order of Business with the Taoiseach.  We are unique in the sense that in Ireland we have directly elected Members of the national Parliament.  That means that every Member who comes into our Parliament has the right to represent the people who elect them directly.  In European countries that does not necessarily apply.  In many countries there are people appointed to parliament and ministries and so on.  I am not in favour of that particular prospect.  The European Union, as an entity, needs to realise that there is a lot of reading to be done on the rights of individuals and in particular the rights of Members of Parliament.<\/p>  <p>There is no situation whereby we should be maligned in the course of European legislation, which suggests that members of Parliament are high-risk with regard to corruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000039#MM00200","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634739720,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan; I believe I have time.  I echo the sentiments that have been expressed in the House this afternoon in respect of Poland.  I share the grave concerns that have been expressed by Members across the House with respect to what is happening with the European Court of Justice regarding climate, about which I intend to speak about today.<\/p>  <p>  Poland is seeking to cancel elements of the European Union's Fit for 55 package, namely, those parts that relate to carbon markets being set up for transport and buildings.  This was a hard-fought agreement; it is not the time to revisit it.  We are in an urgent climate crisis and the package needs to be implemented as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The external affairs agenda item for this week's Council of Europe meeting will undoubtedly feature the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow.  As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Climate Action, I led the Irish delegation to a meeting of the interparliamentary pre-COP26 meeting in Rome the weekend before last, at which my colleagues made very strong contributions.<\/p>  <p>  It was notable that delegates from the developing world who approached us afterwards were keen to discuss themes we raised that had not actually been broached by other nations.  Of particular interest was the issue of trust between our developed societies, that is, those with greatest responsibility for climate change and those which have least responsibility but are bearing its worst effects.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland must work within EU structures to restore trust with developing countries on the issue of climate.  We are rightly concerned about the very hard work we must do at home in Ireland in the area of climate and, in particular, the difficult tasks ahead of us in the areas of agriculture, transport, retrofitting homes and renewable energy.  That task is nothing compared to that in countries where millions will die from hunger due to climate change, however, or countries that will face large-scale flooding or, in the case of small island nations, being wiped off the face of the earth completely.<\/p>  <p>  In Rome, I heard from parliamentarians from developing countries that commitments made to those countries more than ten years ago in Copenhagen have not been met.  It is totally understandable that there is an issue of trust and we should seek to rebuild that trust.  We need to act to show that we are indeed trustworthy and that we can keep our promises.<\/p>  <p>  Another point made by members of our delegation was that Ireland as a country is leading with respect to ambition in reducing carbon emissions.  We were able to say that we, as a small nation, have made an ironclad commitment to reducing emissions by more than 50% within a decade.  The aggregate of small nations will have a greater positive impact on the climate agenda than any one superpower.  We should know that and understand Ireland&rsquo;s influence internationally.  Ireland can lead in the EU and the EU can lead in the world.  We are important, even though we are a small country.  We are important because we are a small country.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the three party leaders in Government but in particular, to the leadership provided by the Taoiseach on the international stage, particularly at the United nations in New York.  He has been showing leadership on climate on the global stage and I urge that we continue to do so through the European Council.  The future of Ireland, the EU and, indeed, the planet depends on urgent global action in climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000040#NN00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1634739720,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I note that a number of items are on the agenda for the upcoming European Council meeting ranging from rising energy costs to migration, external relations and foreign policy issues.<\/p>  <p>  In this State, we have seen more than 30 energy price hikes announced by Irish energy suppliers since the start of the year.  These sharp increases in the cost of energy are adding to increasing costs of living and having a severe impact on people across the State, from students and workers to pensioners.<\/p>  <p>  The ESB provided safe and secure electricity generation to every corner and community in this State.  For many years, our energy prices were among the lowest in EU until the ESB had to set prices higher to encourage competition in the market.  As a result, electricity prices here have gone from being among the lowest to now being among the highest in the EU.  Once again, the market has failed to provide lower and more competitive prices for consumers.  We have already seen several EU member states such as France, Italy and Spain taking decisive action to reduce the burden of these price hikes on ordinary people.  Notably in Spain, consumers will see their average monthly bill drop by 22%.  Therefore, it can be done.<\/p>  <p>  Previous governments were happy to drive up energy prices to encourage competition in the energy sector.  We now need this Government to step up to the plate and follow the lead of other EU member states to put a halt to these runaway energy prices and take some of the burden off ordinary people.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise one particular issue of concern with regard to international relations and issues of foreign policy.  Four days ago, German war planes flew over Jerusalem, Ramallah and the occupied Palestinian territories, undoubtedly terrifying countless people beneath them.  On behalf of my friends who are living in occupied territories, I would like it made clear to European Council members such as Germany, Italy, Greece and France that the racist terror state of Israel does not have the sovereign right to host its military air shows over the occupied territories.<\/p>  <p>  These military incursions are wrong.  They show absolute contempt and are unnecessary.  Most of all, however, they are illegal.  We need, therefore, to make our voice heard and say this display of force and power is not acceptable.  Will the German jets join Israeli jets in bombing Gaza families?  Is that what will happen next?  This sort of behaviour is an act of aggression dressed up as an air show.  The reality is that it is a show of power.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that other EU member states such as Italy, Greece and France, which are taking part in this air show with the Israeli Air Force, need to respect Palestinian airspace and not violate it like the German Luftwaffe has done.  Germany is effectively rubber-stamping Israeli terror.  This is an act of solidarity by Germany, France, Greece and Italy with the racist apartheid state of Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000040#NN00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1634739720,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State a good afternoon.  I welcome this opportunity to make a statement in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels tomorrow and Friday.  I thank the Taoiseach for outlining the agenda, which seems quite full.<\/p>  <p>  I am reassured by the fact that that the pandemic is still top of the list because it is actually still with us.  I am also happy it is there because Ireland has a good story to tell from a pandemic point of view.  Were there imperfections and shortcomings in our response?  Absolutely.  The direction of travel is good, however, and there is a further tranche of reopening on Friday.  We have been a success story despite all the imperfections because of a huge whole-of-society response, which has turned out to be very successful.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from a pandemic point of view, I want to hammer home three points.  First, it was mentioned in the opening statements that there will be increased investment for preparedness and to provide early warning and horizon scanning.  I would definitely be in favour of that.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, needs more resources.  If that could be brought up and nudged forward, it would be very much appreciated.  Vaccines solidarity with the rest of the world is absolute must.  Again, it is in their interest.  There are ethical reasons for it but there is also a self-interest.  Ireland would be very vulnerable if a new strain of the disease or a new mutation in the Delta strain emerged.  It is, therefore, in our interest as well as everybody else's to ensure there is vaccine solidarity.<\/p>  <p>  A proposal is floating around about an international treaty on pandemics, which is being sponsored by the World Health Organization.  I am very much in favour of the principle of such a thing.  We must see the detail, obviously enough, but pandemics by definition are global and, therefore, the response should be global as well.  It would make sense that we capture the lessons learned from this pandemic in order that if another takes place in five months, five years or 55 years&rsquo; time, we have one singular document into which we can put the lessons we have learned over the last couple of years as a response.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the sentiments of some of my colleagues from an energy prices point of view.  It is a massive issue and we are reasonable enough to realise that there are factors beyond our control.  The world economy is opening up.  There are geopolitical frictions and games at play.  We appreciate that.  Many speculators are making a lot of money from it as well.  Perhaps there is some mechanism by which the EU could apply downward pressure on prices by taking on these speculators.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that there is a short-term need to address the short-term problem.<\/p> <p>The first frost will be landing in a few weeks' time.  However, the long-term need is microgeneration of electricity and its democratisation.  Some of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants come indirectly from Brussels but if we could increase those grants, it would certainly make a big difference.  People are keen to microgenerate but they do not have the upfront cash to install the relevant equipment.  We are okay in Ireland on the digital transformation agenda.  The national broadband plan is eight months behind, but there are reasons for it.  Cybersecurity was mentioned in the opening statement.  There have been modest improvements in cybersecurity since the HSE attack a few months ago, but there is certainly much more work to do.  Cyberattacks are a transnational issue.  Perhaps we need an entity at European level to co-ordinate and improve our defences.  I wish the Taoiseach and the Irish team well and I look forward to his update when he returns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000040#NN00400","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634740320,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate and the commitment by the Government to raise very important issues, such as energy prices.

A litre of petrol there was &euro;1.64 but it can cost &euro;1.70 in north County Dublin.  There is a need for the Government to ensure prices are regulated and that inspectors can go in if people are ripping people off, which I have no doubt they are.  It is time to change that.

However, in advance of criticising the rule of law Poland, on which I share the views of the Minister of State, we need to reflect a little on the rule of law in Ireland.  There are a couple of issues I would like to bring to the Minister of State's attention.  First, the failure to properly promulgate in a timely manner the statutory instruments on restrictions for Covid-19 has been repeatedly criticised in this Chamber, as well as by legal academics and human rights activists.  Today is 20 October and the new regime is to come into place on 22 October.  People are supposed to act accordingly, yet no law or regulations have been promulgated and we have no idea when they will be promulgated.  It will probably be some time on 22 October, after they have theoretically come into effect.  That is not rule of law.  One of the central tenets of rule of law is that people can ascertain what the law is and behave accordingly.  That needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue I will raise relates to the challenges brought to the previous regulations in courts.  The regulations had lapsed by the time the court got to hear the challenge and the court stated it did not have sufficient resources to hear it.  That is an absence of an effective remedy, which again is a huge problem.  The exact same regulation was brought in subsequently, even though it could not be challenged previously.  Again, access to an effective remedy is a central tenet of the rule of law.<\/p>  <p>  The third issue I draw to the Minister of State's attention is the O'Keeffe judgment against Ireland in the European Court of Human Rights.  ECHR judgments are not enforceable, or cannot be relied upon, in the domestic legal order in the same way that judgments by the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, can.  Nevertheless, there is an expectation that human rights violations will be remedied, not just for the applicants in a particular case but more broadly.  That has not yet happened in this case.  We need to look at that.  I would hate for the Minister of State to go over there and speak about the rule of law in Poland and to be labelled a hypocrite while he is there.  It would be embarrassing for Ireland, which has a proud tradition of adherence to the rule of law, democracy and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000042#PP00700","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1634740920,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The next European Council meeting will certainly keep the Taoiseach busy.  Much of the preparatory work will be done by 21 October.  Nonetheless, some important issues will be on the table.  Among the headline topics are the response Covid-19, soaring energy prices, digital transformation and some upcoming international summits.  However, since Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki commandeered the microphone in the European Parliament yesterday and accused EU institutions of undermining Polish sovereignty, the stage has been set.  Perhaps it was already set, with the ruling from the Polish constitutional court, but yesterday&rsquo;s public ramping up of the conflict was deliberate.  President von der Leyen was up-front in her comments.<\/p>  <p>  Tomorrow, the European Parliament will vote on a resolution which \"deeply deplores the decision of the illegitimate 'Constitutional Tribunal' of 7 October 2021 as an attack on the European community of values and laws as a whole\".  Given the comments of many MEPs, including Government MEPs, I expect that motion will be carried.  That is what the Taoiseach is walking into.  To be honest, I would liked to have heard a little more of his perspective on this matter.  While I am not calling for megaphone diplomacy - there has been far too much of that already - I would still like to hear some clear, straightforward statements, either from the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, in his intervention, on the issue of rule of law in Poland.  My view is that while we must be firm and resolute in our defence of the rule of law, human rights, LGBTI and women's rights, equally, we must not be provoked into any tit-for-tat reaction.  We must continue to seek a common approach at EU level.  There are issues around conditionality of EU funds, which need to be explored.  However, we need to look at them carefully because there are double-edged sword.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the EU protocol, I place on record my appreciation of the work of Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d.  As with Michel Barnier, Mr. &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d's knowledge and deep understanding of the many complex issues surrounding the protocol, the Good Friday Agreement and the context in which they are set have proven invaluable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000042#PP00900","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1634740920,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their statements.  The agenda for this week's meeting of the European Council was discussed yesterday in Luxemburg at the General Affairs Council, GAC, which I attended.  The Taoiseach has outlined his expectations for the European Council's discussions, as Members have also reflected, on Covid-19, digital, energy prices, trade and migration.  Deputies should make no mistake; energy prices will probably be the signature issue of this particular summit.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies mentioned EU-UK relations and Brexit.  These are not on the agenda, but I have no doubt that leaders will consult the Taoiseach and listen to his views on the matter.  If my engagements yesterday or anything to go by, they will be interested in the Irish position and supportive of the European Commission.  I am pleased that the proposals from the European Commission have been well received across the board in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the rule of law has been raised.  I agree with almost everything that Deputies said, as does the Taoiseach.  I have spoken out on this, both publicly and privately, at every opportunity.  The General Affairs Council deals with the rule of law at almost every meeting.  The European Union is a Community of law and values.  Without acceptance of this and consistent implementation, our unity and the functioning of the Union breaks down.  The values in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union underpin everything we do together, including the rule of law.  This must be respected by all member states.  As member states, there is an onus on all of us to comply with the determinations of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  As part of membership of the Union, it is essential that member states accept the primacy of EU law where it applies.  The judgment of the Polish constitutional court is a cause of concern.  It is only the latest development to highlight concerns about the direction of travel in Poland, including as regards judicial independence.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has supported the development of tools, such as the budget conditionality.  In fact, we were party to the case in the European Court of Justice last week in support of the European position.  We want to support the Commission in fulfilling its vital role in ensuring adherence to the obligations of the EU treaty.  We fully welcome and support what President von der Leyen said in the European Parliament on Tuesday.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of anti-Semitism will be on the agenda.  I was proud that the Taoiseach attended the Malm&ouml; conference.  I appeal to Deputies, when speaking about anti-Semitism, to keep that issue and Israel-Palestine separate.  They should not bring Israel-Palestine into discussion.  Anti-Semitism is an evil which needs to be tackled, full stop.

The European Council will discuss preparations for the 13th Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, on 25 and 26 November.  This biannual summit will bring together leaders from the 51 ASEM partner countries along with the institutional leaders from the EU and Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, under the theme of strengthening multilateralism for shared growth.  This year's event is under the chairmanship of Cambodia.  Due to Covid-19, the summit will be held in a virtual format.  It will mark the 25th anniversary of ASEM.  There are two planned outcome documents for the summit, including a chair's statement on the theme of multilateralism and the Phnom Penh statement on post-Covid socioeconomic recovery, a matter of shared interest to European and Asian leaders alike.  The Taoiseach will represent Ireland at the summit.<\/p>  <p>  The Eastern Partnership was launched in 2009 as a framework for co-operation between the EU and six partner countries, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Belarus.  Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine's relations with the EU are based on respective association agreements and the countries aspire to eventual EU membership.  The EU's relationship with Azerbaijan and Armenia is based on partnership agreements.  The Lukashenko regime in Belarus suspended its involvement in the Eastern Partnership in June following our sanctions.  The sixth Eastern Partnership summit will be held at head of state or government level on 15 December 2021, preceded by a ministerial summit in Brussels on 15 November.  On 2 July 2021, the European Commission published a joint staff working document setting out a new framework for the Eastern Partnership, focusing on the themes of reform, recovery and resilience.  This will be accompanied by a &euro;17 billion investment plan to deliver on objectives.  The Commission hopes that the new framework will be endorsed at the December summit.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has three priorities relating to the Eastern Partnership.  We believe in greater economic links and macrofinancial assistance but only to the extent that partner countries make domestic improvements in the areas of gender equality, good governance, human rights, the rule of law and democracy.  Second, on a related matter, Ireland believes that the Eastern Partnership as a framework must be more values-driven.  Third, we support the principles of inclusivity and differentiation within the partnership, tailoring the partnership to the different needs and aspirations of each individual partner.<\/p>  <p>  The COP26 is due to take place in Glasgow from 31 October until 12 November.  COP26 is the five-year COP after the Paris Agreement.  Parties are expected to submit updated and more ambitious nationally determined contributions which articulate the parties' climate policies.  This exercise, which was established by the UN parties, is on track to reach the objective of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to below 2&deg;C and to drive it towards 1.5&deg;C.  The EU has submitted a nationally determined contribution, NDC, on behalf of member states outlining at least a 55% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the achievement of net-zero emissions by 2050.  Ireland is an active member of the EU delegation to COP26, participating in EU expert groups, including financing, adaptation, science and agriculture, and finalising the Paris rulebook which will govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  In line with the EU's position, Ireland will continue to reiterate its strong support for the Paris Agreement as the foremost multilateral mechanism to drive global climate action.<\/p>  <p>  A key issue ahead of COP26, which will influence the outcome of the COP, is climate finance.  The financial commitments made by developed countries party to COP15 in 2009 and COP21 in 2015 have not yet been met.  There is increasing pressure on donor countries, including EU member states, to signal further actions to meet their climate finance commitments, with a particular focus on financing adaptation to climate change.  Ireland has a long track record of providing for balanced shared climate finance for adaptation and grant-based finance for least developed countries and small island developing states.<\/p>  <p>  The first part of the 15th meeting of the UN Biodiversity Conference, COP15, took place from 11 to 15 October.  The second part will reconvene with in-person meetings in Kunming, China, from 25 April to 8 May next year.  Ireland was represented at the high-level segment from 12 to 13 October by the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan.  Reversing the trend of biodiversity loss is a major challenge for the coming decade and should be one of our top priorities.  It is in this context that discussions have taken place on the development of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework, to be agreed in Kunming in 2022.  Ireland is working with EU partners to present a strong, coherent voice for a global biodiversity framework that provides for the transformative change that the biodiversity crisis demands.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, the EU published a strategy for biodiversity to 2030.  The headline goal of the strategy is to transform at least 30% of Europe's lands and seas into effectively managed, protected areas and to bring back at least 10% of agricultural area under high diversity landscape features.  This strategy was endorsed by the European Council in October 2020.  The strategy forms the basis of the negotiation position for the EU and member states at COP15.<\/p>  <p>  I thank members for their active participation in the debate.  This particular format does not allow me to answer questions but I will do so next week.  I thank all Members of the House, both Government and Opposition, for our unified approach to the issue of Brexit.  That gives the country incredible strength when dealing with our European partners, which also show the same unity.  We are grateful for the unity here and within the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000043#QQ01100","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage","time":1634741520,"counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000043#QQ01200"},{"type":"speech","time":1634741520,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Second Stage of this important legislation.

In addition, it is important that critical links and synergies are developed between TESS, AEARS, and other key services under the Department of Education to enhance and develop supports to vulnerable children in the educational context.  Both Government Departments will work closely to support this objective, with the core principle of the best interests of the child.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minster for Education and her officials for their engagement and collaboration with officials in my Department and with Tusla during this process.  I thank the Attorney General for his assistance in drafting the legislation.  I believe the Bill passed with all-party support in the Seanad.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to outline the provisions of this Bill and I look forward to hearing Deputies' views on its contents.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000043#QQ01300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634742120,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Deputies Funchion, Martin Kenny, Ward and &Oacute; Laoghaire are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000044#RR00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1634742120,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I am delighted to see this legislation go through.  The Minister knows I am supportive of it.  I raised this issue in the previous D&aacute;il, from 2016 onwards.<\/p> <p>I will focus my remarks solely on the school completion programme.  Historically, it was an educational programme and then it was transferred out of the Department of Education.  It is great that it is going back there because it has an educational role.  Some people do not fully understand what the school completion programme is.  In fact, I have come across people who think it relates to the building of schools.  When you know the programme, it is amazing.  I love having the opportunity to talk about it.  I have experience with the programme in Kilkenny and I am aware that there are 122 programmes nationwide.  In future, if funding permits, it will be something that should be rolled out to all primary and secondary schools because of the key work it does, that so many other services do not, which is to focus on the child and the child's needs.  It can identify a child who may be struggling or falling behind.  That may be due to a learning difficulty or there may be something going on a home at a particular time in a child's life.  There are many and varied reasons why children struggle at school.  It becomes a vicious cycle.  If you start to struggle at school, then you struggle with your homework and then you do not do your homework, you go into school without your homework done and then one day, you start to think you do not want to go to school.  It is not as bad when children are in primary school because parents drop children to school to a greater extent but as children go into secondary school and into their teenage years, some of the power goes away from parents and children make their own decisions.  Some parents face a battle with their children in school.<\/p> <p> The school completion programme is invaluable, for example, in terms of its homework clubs.  They are not just the standard approach of going there for an hour to do your homework; you get assistance with the homework, which can help with your day-to-day schooling.  Play therapy and counselling are also provided, depending on the age.  The approach taken must be age-appropriate.  I know of families where there was a sudden bereavement that were, ironically, lucky enough to be in a school where the school completion programme was offered, and they were able to access play therapy and counselling.  If they were not in such a school, it would have been a battle.  They would have had to go through the child and adolescent mental health services, CAHMS, process and it would have been a disaster.  Counselling is often done during school time.  You are not putting a big red circle around children, which is so important.  Children often do not even realise they are getting the supports.  One school I am aware of had two homework clubs.  One was provided as part of the school completion programme but no child realised there was any difference between it and the other homework club.  That is invaluable because it breaks the stigma and labelling of children.<\/p> <p> My party leader, Deputy McDonald, met people involved with the school completion programme in Kilkenny over the summer.  We were able to meet people who had gone through the programme, who had finished school and gone into employment.  They were success stories.  The programme is amazing in terms of the work it does for the small amount of money that is provided.  The Department of Education is the right location for the programme.  I wanted to focus my remarks on it because I always take the opportunity to speak about the school completion programme.  I extend an invitation to the Minister to visit the programme's office in Kilkenny.  He would be welcome to visit either of the programme's offices in my constituency, even though the programme's remit is moving from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to the Department of Education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000044#RR00300","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634742720,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Deputy Funchion has already stated that we support the Bill.  There is a logic to educational welfare issues being returned to the Department of Education.  This is probably similar to a conversation I had with the Minister previously about the range of beneficial work that falls within the ambit of Tusla.  However, Tusla has specific pieces of work that make it difficult for certain vulnerable families to deal with it.<\/p><p>I echo what Deputy Function says about the vital work that is done by the school completion programme.  I have seen this in operation for many years.  It fits into the wider conversation when we are talking about family and community supports.  We know we cannot deal with every issue that arises with children and keeping them within the educational fold.  Many children have different issues depending on their background and there are multiple other issues.  I have seen cases where those involved in the school completion programme have gone above and beyond in their engagement with children and have facilitated them and kept them within the process.  No more than others who carry out such work in communities, they end up creating <i>ad hoc<\/i>networks and using other community and voluntary groups and NGOs within the wider community to access some of their funding to carry out joint projects.  It is beneficial and, in fairness, it creates a safe environment in which children can operate.<\/p><p>Deputy Funchion spoke about the necessity of breakfast clubs and after-school supports.  There are obvious benefits that come from them.  It is a piece of the puzzle that we must put properly together because, to a degree, our approach can be <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  We do not necessarily have all the pieces working together and we are not putting the puzzle together as it should be.  I apologise for being a broken record, but I must refer to the difficulties with the national childcare scheme, NCS, especially in terms of after-school care for children in the most deprived areas.  We must find a solution.  In fairness, I appreciate the work the Minister has done and the short-term interim fix that is Tusla.  That includes all the caveats to which I referred, that many families do not want to go near Tusla, as it will frighten them.  I ask the Minister to play his part in making the interim solution as easy as possible for operators.  I refer to the centres such as in Moneymore, and the houses in Cox's Demesne and in Grange Drive in Muirhevnamore.  Last week the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, visited Garda youth diversion programmes and he happened to visit two that were operating out of those two campuses that are providing multiple projects.  We have seen real benefits.  They can also point out the mistakes that have been made previously in terms of community and family support.  I refer to the youth justice strategy that is separate from child support programmes.  Sometimes groups put it together but when the State is putting plans together, we must put in place a plan that gives us the best bang for our buck, in order that we can give the best support we can possibly give to those that need it.  I have seen multiple positive results with school completion programmes and other programmes.  Part of the reason that happens is possibly because they are all connected in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>fashion.  We must facilitate that.<\/p><p>As regards the NCS, like everybody else, I await the report in November which should give us the facility down the line to deal with a better funding model that can deal directly with these types of projects and we can remove them from the work done by the NCS as regards job activation and other such activities.  I support what is being done in the Bill.  It makes sense.  We must revisit the conversation on Tusla and the possibility that early intervention may need to be taken away from the other work Tusla does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000045#SS00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1634742720,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I will speak about school completion and the overly elaborate funding streams that were operated by Tusla.<\/p> <p>Hopefully, this Bill will stop that happening again.  I want to tell the story of the Get Ahead Club, which was a vital service in the north Clondalkin area that offered a wide range of community-based educational initiatives aimed at increasing children's chances of completing school.  It was based in north Clondalkin and Lucan and operated in schools in Neilstown, Rowlagh, Quarryvale and Balgaddy.  Approximately 120 children a year benefited from this programme in the Get Ahead Club.  As I mentioned, these programmes included homework clubs, breakfast clubs and recreational activities.  The children who used this club were from a disadvantaged area with a higher than national average level of early school dropout.  As we all know, early intervention is key to a child's development and key to finishing education.<\/p> <p> The funding stream for this service came from Tusla to the local school completion programme, which then directed the funding to the Get Ahead Club.  Somewhere along the line, a decision was made not to allow the local school completion programme to act as the conduit for the funding.  I met the Minister's predecessor, Katherine Zappone, on this issue just after the by-election.  I was only in the House and it was one of the first things I was working on in the search for a resolution.  Our pleas fell on deaf ears and, ultimately, the Get Ahead Club closed its doors and it is lost to the people of north Clondalkin and Lucan forever - it is gone.  These convoluted funding mechanisms and bureaucratic red tape resulted in the closure of this vital service.  I will be going back to the Minister for Education to ask her to revisit this issue, and I will be happy to send her on all of the information that is needed.  I hope this legislation stops something like that happening again.<\/p> <p> I spoke with the Minister before on child poverty.  One of the basic needs for a child in completing their education is food in the child's belly in order to just get through the day.  We had a very emotive debate that day, if I remember correctly.  I want to talk about eligibility for the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, scheme, DEIS status and how that has worked.  For example, as a child myself, I benefited from the free lunch programme in school.  I was not alone and as all of my friends and family benefited from it, there was no stigma associated with it.  I still remember which sandwich I got on which day and I remember looking forward to the currant bun on a Friday, at the end of the week.  That is what got me through the week and it got a lot of people through the week in the area where I grew up.  It enabled us to take part in school in the best way we could.  My parents and teachers are probably listening to this and will say it did not work but, at the time, it got me through it.<\/p> <p> There are other areas of my constituency that are not traditional areas of disadvantage but which have pockets of poverty within them.  This is due to the fact of housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants living in private housing estates but it also involves people who are not traditionally in poverty but who are renting and paying high levels of rent in these areas.  This is creating food poverty and income poverty because they are paying extortionate rates, and children from these backgrounds are going to school hungry.  Parents from these areas tell me they are accessing the local food bank.  I do a bit of work with the Quarryvale and Clondalkin Cares Food Bank, and they tell me people are accessing their services from areas that are not traditionally disadvantaged.  That needs to be looked at.  DEIS needs to be modernised and brought up to a 2021 level so no child will go to school hungry and come home from school hungry, because that would be a travesty.<\/p> <p> My last point, which is tied into this, is in regard to school completion.  We mentioned food in the belly and the school completion programmes but there is also access to healthcare.  One of the big issues at the moment is in regard to dental care.  A report from the Irish Dental Association states that an increasing number of children are only being offered examinations of dental care for the first time at sixth class instead of at first, second, fourth and sixth class.  When I was in school, it was at first, second, fourth and sixth class that we got dental care.  This should be a priority for either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education, or something needs to be worked on between them in order to provide that.  In my own area of Dublin Mid-West, we have seen a 62% decrease in the number of dental screenings in the last year, which is simply not good enough.  As we know there are strong links between good oral health and good physical health, it is vital that the HSE and the Department of Education develop a contingency plan in order that children can receive this vital service, which will enable them to finish school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000045#SS00300","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634743320,"counter":429,"content":"<p>With regard to the legislation, I believe it makes sense to have these functions within the Department of Education.  It is logical and the feedback I get from school completion projects and from education welfare officers is that it is logical.  There are some issues and concerns that we need to watch but that is not a reason not to do it.  When they were in Tusla, some education welfare officers who had to take, for example, a section 29, felt it was useful, in order to convince parents they were on their side, to say they were not employed by the Department of Education but that they worked for Tusla.  That is certainly not a reason not to proceed with it.  The reasons, by and large, make sense.  A lot of these functions began with the Department of Education in the first place, although I think some of them actually started with the city and county councils.  I know school completion workers, particularly education welfare officers, will function independently because I have confidence in them to do that.  What is important is that the perception is out there and that they have the ability to represent the fact they are independent.<\/p>  <p>  We often talk of education in terms of achievement and results and the biggest story in education in many years is the leaving certificate and everything that goes with it.  However, what can often be forgotten is that for many students, many families and many schools, ensuring that the child finishes school is an enormous achievement in itself.  We need to recognise the fact that for many schools, school completion workers, families and particularly the students themselves, that is a big effort that involves a lot of work, and it does not happen by accident.  That is why we have school completion, namely, to make sure they have the assistance they need.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps we have never needed it more than we need it now.  Covid, for reasons that were in many ways unavoidable, has meant the connection that some students had with education was disrupted.  There are reports that 4,500 young people did not return to school when it reopened following Covid.  That is a significant and worrying number.  For each of those, this is enormously tied in with their future.  We need to invest in it.  While the Covid learning and support scheme which was announced by the Minister is welcome, it does not go far enough to ensure that young people at risk of becoming disengaged are supported and included.  Additional teaching hours are well and good but that is not going to deal with potential regression for people like that.  It is a pity there was no increase in funding for school completion in the budget.<\/p>  <p>  I will talk about DEIS shortly.  There is an argument that every child and every school should have access to a school completion worker, not necessarily that one would be allocated to each school, but that there would be one across a number of schools that are non-DEIS or across a catchment area.  Challenges can happen in a family&rsquo;s life or an individual's life, and disadvantage may be more dispersed than it once was.  There is an argument for that.<\/p>  <p>  We are looking at the expansion of DEIS, which is welcome.  The last time DEIS was expanded, although it was welcome, a huge opportunity was missed in that no DEIS band 2 schools were added.  Schools at DEIS band 2 went up to DEIS band 1 and some schools went straight in at DEIS band 1.  That means schools that might not have the very highest levels of disadvantage to justify the much-reduced pupil-teacher ratios could have qualified for DEIS band 2 had that criteria been used, could have accessed school completion, could have accessed home-school community liaison and could have accessed school meals, and it is much less expensive than DEIS band 1.  This review needs to involve new DEIS band 1 schools but it has to crack that whole area.  It has to ensure that schools that could benefit from those things do benefit.<\/p>  <p>  To give an example, I spoke to a principal in a non-DEIS school this morning.  In recent weeks, it had a family who had a related family in the school.  They arrived in Ireland and they are trying to sort out everything to do with PPS numbers and all the rest of it.  The school had to deal with six additional children from a family with very little money and no place to stay.  It tried to organise uniforms and tried to help them settle in.  That school did not have home-school liaison and school completion, and this was all left on the principal&rsquo;s desk.  That is not how it should be.  Schools facing these challenges need additional support and that includes school completion and home-school liaison.  It is vital this is looked at in the expansion of DEIS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000046#TT00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1634743320,"counter":430,"content":"<p>We must adjourn the debate for the sos.

I  want to begin my contribution by commending and thanking those citizens - the 99 women and men, and the Chair - who gave their time and consideration to developing the 45 recommendations that have come from the citizens' assembly seeking to achieve greater gender equality in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 provided an unexpected and unwelcome interruption to their work.  It is a credit to the chair, Catherine Day, and the team working with her, for innovating and allowing the citizens' assembly to continue in a virtual format.  It is striking that, at such a difficult time in our country's history, the members of the citizens' assembly made time in their lives and homes for this important work, working to create a more equal Ireland.  They have given us an example of citizenship at work, one that we should all hope to emulate.  In as much as we thank them, it is important also to thank the families of those 99 individuals.  As we know, when meetings are held by way of Zoom or Skype, a room is out of play and the family have to help to keep the dog quiet, look after the children or whatever.  Therefore, I recognise the work of those individuals' families.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to particularly thank Catherine Day for taking on the role of chair in this process and leading the citizens' assembly so effectively in the face of the challenges thrown up by Covid-19.  As the Minister with responsibility for gender equality, many of the recommendations relate to my work but a good many others fall under the responsibility of a number of my ministerial colleagues and I will work with them to provide these with the necessary in-depth consideration.<\/p>  <p>  It is illustrative of the need for gender equality mainstreaming across society if we are truly to make a difference in gender equality.  As the members of the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality set out in their open letter to the Oireachtas, \"we looked back into Ireland's history, we looked at present day society and we are now submitting to you a new view of a future Ireland where gender equality is the norm\".  They have set out a vision of how we can achieve gender equality, based on their considerations, and it is now the responsibility of Members of the Oireachtas to consider and respond to those recommendations.  Policy to promote gender equality in Ireland is a key component of the work of my Department.  The national strategy for women and girls provides a framework for the whole-of-government approach to gender equality.  That strategy was brought to a close this year, having been extended by a year in response to the impact of Covid-19, and work will begin to identify the future strategic path for gender equality in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I want to move to address some of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, in particular those which fall under my responsibility.  The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality makes three recommendations for amendment to the Constitution.  The first is to amend Article 40.1o of the Constitution to refer explicitly to gender equality and non-discrimination.  The second is to amend Article 41o of the Constitution so that it would protect private and family life, with the protection afforded to the family not limited to the marital family.  The third is to delete Article 41.2o of the Constitution and replace it with language that is not gender specific and obliges the State to take reasonable measures to support care within the home and across the wider community.  These three recommendations propose significant amendments to the Constitution and will require careful consideration for their legal and policy implications.  Across the House, I think we can agree there is language in the Constitution which does not reflect the country Ireland is today.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations do not contain specific language proposals and this will form part of what the Government must have regard to.  This is not an easy task and it will take time.  I am mindful that consideration of the question of Article 41.2o under the previous Government did not identify language which could be used as a replacement clause to reflect the importance of care work in society.  However, my officials are working with the Department of An Taoiseach to find a way forward.  I am particularly interested to hear the views of Deputies in this debate on what would be suitable language to use in the Constitution to recognise the importance of care in the home but move away from the very gendered language contained in Article 41.2o.<\/p>  <p>  The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality also makes a range of specific recommendations under the broad heading of care, some of which fall under the remit of my Department.  There are specific recommendations made on paid leave for parents.  The provision of family leave has gone through many advancements in recent years, with the extension of unpaid parental leave and the introduction of paid parent's leave since providing flexibility and support to working parents trying to balance work and the important work of caring for their children.  Earlier this year I brought forward the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021, which further extended parent's leave to five weeks for each parent of a child under the age of two.  This leave is available to the parent of a child and their spouse or cohabitant to reflect the complexity of family life in Ireland.  As announced in last week's budget, this leave will be extended to seven weeks for each parent from mid-2022.  I look forward to implementing those provisions next July.  The consequent benefit payment will also be extended for up to seven weeks.<\/p>  <p>  These developments provide a significant amount of leave available to families to care for their child in his or her earliest months and the provisions of the EU work-life balance directive require nine weeks of paid non-transferable leave for each parent by August 2024, the provision of which will be considered in the context of the citizens' assembly recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Other recommendations focus on early learning and childcare and I recognise the provision of affordable, accessible and quality early learning and childcare services is a very important measure in addressing gender equality.  Women are still overwhelmingly responsible for childcare, whether looking after their children themselves at home, organising childcare or working in the early learning and childcare sector.  We need to reduce this burden on mothers by making it easier for families to access affordable, quality early learning and childcare which meets their needs.  We also need to encourage parents to share responsibility for this care.  Recent developments regarding family leave, including paternity leave, parent's leave and parental leave will go way some way to address this, and so too will recent and planned developments in early learning and childcare.<\/p>  <p>  The citizens' assembly has made a number of significant recommendations on this area.  These are to move to a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of quality, affordable early years and out-of-hours childcare over the next decade; to increase the State share of GDP spent on childcare, from the current 0.37% of GDP to at least 1% by no later than 2030 in line with the UNICEF target; and to address the specific needs of lone parents to incentivise and support them in accessing work or education, including provision of child and after-school care.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the assembly's recommendation that we need to take further steps towards a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of quality, affordable early years and out-of-hours childcare over the next decade.  We also need to increase State investment.  We need to address the specific needs of lone parents.  Work is under way in my Department to do just that.  First 5, the whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families, commits to doubling investment in early learning and childcare over the period 2019 to 2028 so that by 2028 investment in the sector will reach some &euro;1 billion per year.<\/p>  <p>  This strategy also commits to developing a new funding model which will be the key vehicle to ensure this additional investment delivers for children, families and the State.  An independently chaired expert group was convened in 2019 to lead on this work.  The work of the group is informed by a significant programme of research, delivered by a research partner, Frontier Economics.<\/p> <p>The expert group has also undertaken extensive consultation and engagement with stakeholders.<\/p> <p> The report reflects the two years of detailed planning, consultation and research that is being finalised and will be submitted in November and it informed my approach to budget 2022.  Budget 2022 has been recognised by advocates in the early learning and childcare sector as historic and a step change for the sector.  Funding for early learning and childcare in 2022 will increase next year by &euro;78 million to a total of &euro;716 million.  This funding will allow my Department to continue: the implementation of the universal early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme for more than 100,000 children for the two years before they begin primary school; the implementation of the access and inclusion model programme of supports that enable more than 5,000 children with a disability participate in the ECCE programme; and the implementation of the national childcare scheme, NCS, which delivers universal and targeted subsidies to up to 80,000 children in line with their income and other circumstances.<\/p> <p> Critically, the additional investment next year will also allow my Department to extend the NCS universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,170 per child per annum to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefiting up to 40,000 children.  It will remove the practice of deducting hours spent in preschool or school from the entitlement to NCS-subsidised hours, benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families, which is an issue we have regularly discussed in this Chamber and that was a change I was pleased to introduce.  It will also introduce a new funding stream with an estimated total cost of &euro;69 million in September 2022 with a full year cost of over &euro;200 million for approximately 4,700 early learning and childcare providers.  Providers will be eligible for this new funding stream to help cover increased operating costs linked to quality improvement measures.  This additional funding will support early learning and childcare providers to attract and retain staff, including degree-qualified staff, and will support the programme for Government commitment to support the drawing up of an employment regulation order for up to 30,000 staff in the sector.  In return for this investment a commitment will be sought from providers not to increase parents' fees.  For the first time, next year the State will have some control over fees charged to parents by childcare providers.<\/p> <p> Budget 2022 will also allow for further enhancements to regulatory and quality supports for the implementation of the national action plan for childminding, a new workforce development plan and the registration and inspection system for the quality of early learning and childcare.  First 5 commitments chime with the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly and progress made on implementing First 5 is significant.  Budget 2022 marks the beginning of a transformative multi-annual investment programme for the early learning and childcare sector, making significant progress on the First 5 commitment to increase spending to &euro;1 billion per year by 2028 and on efforts to improve access, affordability and quality of provision.<\/p> <p> The Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality also makes important recommendations on encouraging women in leadership, including the use of quotas.  It is central to ensuring that our society responds to the challenges of gender equality and that women are encouraged and supported in joining political life and in engaging in leadership.  Targets are a feature of some ongoing existing gender equality measures, including the provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which link the State funding of political parties in the Electoral Acts to the achievement of a gender balance in candidate selection for D&aacute;il general elections.  To receive full State funding under the Electoral Acts, a qualified political party had to have at least 30% women candidates and at least 30% men candidates at the election.  The legislation provides that this quota will rise to 40% in 2023, seven years after the February 2016 general election.<\/p> <p> The Government's long-standing target of 40% gender balance on State boards has had some success, having been met by approximately half of such boards, while the average representation of women among board members is over 40%.  In business leadership, the Balance for Better Business review group is an independent business-led review group established by the Government to improve gender balance in senior business leadership in Ireland.  Balance for Better Business has set actionable and progressive targets for companies listed on Euronext Dublin and for private companies in Ireland to encourage them to address the gender balance issue on their boards and leadership teams as a matter of priority.  The latest data from Balance for Better Business in March 2021 show that the number of women on the boards of Ireland's top 20 listed companies has reached 30%, up from just 18% when the initiative was launched in 2018.  Revised targets in its third report, to be achieved by the end of 2023, include a target of 33% of female representation on boards of ISEQ 20 listed companies and 25% for other listed companies.  Targets of 30% female representation on boards of large Irish-owned private companies and 35% for leadership teams have also been set.<\/p> <p> The Citizen's Assembly also makes a series of recommendations around gender equality in pay and in the workplace.  Gender equality in the workplace, particularly in pay, is also a feature of the national strategy for women and girls.  Earlier this year the Oireachtas passed the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021, which will introduce gender pay gap reporting for the first time.  This is one of the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality.  I look forward to bringing forward regulations on this by the end of this year and to a structure to permit reporting beginning in the coming year.  Having this information available to us about some of our largest employers will enable us to identify where the gender pay gap is most significant and will direct focused efforts to address the gender pay gap across different industries.  It will also be a positive to employers, with those that can demonstrate gender pay equality within their organisations likely to be more attractive to prospective employees.<\/p> <p> The recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly on the gender equality principle in law and policy are particularly pertinent to the work of my Department.  The equality and gender equality policy unit leads on the co-ordination of gender equality policy across Government, including leading the national strategy for women and girls, and developing initiatives to address gender equality.  As the national strategy for women and girls will conclude this year, my Department will lead on examining and developing a successor cross-Government strategic policy on gender equality.  In developing a strategic approach it is vital that we can measure the extent of inequality and how well our initiatives are working.<\/p> <p> The importance of gathering and being able to disaggregate data on the equality grounds is recognised in the national strategy for women and girls and it requires all Departments to identify knowledge gaps on gender inequality and use this as a basis to drive improvements in the data infrastructure and analysis required to close those gaps.  That lack of data is as pertinent in areas to do with race, disability and other areas where there is discrimination as it is in the area of gender.  The anti-racism committee is bringing forward similar recommendations on the need for greater availability of data on race and that is something the Department will be bringing forward.<\/p> <p> In line with an OECD recommendation to develop an equality data strategy, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, completed a data audit, in co-operation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimensions.  A report on this audit was published in October 2020 and my officials are examining the possibility of developing a equality data strategy with the CSO.  Gender budgeting across Government is being developed under the leadership of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and some 12 Departments are reporting equality budgeting metrics.  Earlier this year the Government agreed to the establishment of an interdepartmental group for equality budgeting to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government Departments.  This group will play a key role in guiding the continued progress of equality budgeting.<\/p> <p> I note also the specific recommendations on equality legislation and these are timely in the context of the review of the Equal Status Acts, which has begun in my Department.  At the request of a number of NGOs we have extended the time period for public consultation on the review of equality legislation but that is a significant initiative that the Department is taking on.  Our equality legislation has served us well but it is 20 years since it was originally introduced and now is the right time to ensure it is fit for purpose, to examine the nine grounds and to consider additional grounds.  We have made specific recommendations in the context of the gender ground as well.<\/p> <p> I would like to again thank the members of the Citizen's Assembly for taking the time at a difficult period during Covid-19 to give such in-depth consideration to the issues that came before them.<\/p> <p>I thank the chair of the assembly, Dr. Catherine Day, for steering it through and delivering to the Oireachtas 45 important recommendations.  Some of these are at the level of constitutional amendments and we must bring parties together to consider what is the best language to use in our Constitution to reflect these ideals.  Some measures are being progressed in my Department.  Where others are concerned, we will outline how we will progress them in my Department as well as across other Departments.<\/p> <p> I will reference a line of the open letter sent by the members of the assembly to us in the Oireachtas.  It reads: \"We urge you to match our commitment by accepting our recommendations and implementing them without delay to deliver gender equality for Ireland.\"  This is a challenge to all of us, and one that the Government and my Department are up to tackling.  I look forward to working with Deputies across the Chamber in implementing the recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000047#AAA00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634745120,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Next is Deputy Funchion, who is sharing time with a number of her colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000049#CCC00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1634745120,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  It is important that we use every opportunity to discuss the ways in which we can encourage and create pathways for more women to become involved, be that in civic life or, through greater pay equality, in positions of leadership in the public and private sectors.  In our submission to the assembly, we expressed the view that women themselves must be the ones to determine the solutions to dismantling the barriers they face.  It is equally vital that migrant women, women from the LGBTQI+ community, carers, including those who care for children, women outside the traditional workforce, women with disabilities and Traveller women, to name but a few, be included in this process.<\/p>  <p>  There are practical examples of where Government policy can positively challenge gender stereotypes.  Recently, the Department of Education acknowledged that the gender gap at third level was heavily influenced by subject choices and, as a result, career guidance at second level was undertaken.  This is a perfect example of where the Government can effect positive change.<\/p>  <p>  Despite some progress, we still have a long way to go as a country.  A recent OECD report on equality budgeting found that there was no overarching strategy or set of goals in Ireland and it was difficult to judge if any of the goals being set by Departments independently were having any real impact or meeting needs.  The Minister referred to this in the context of the lack of data, which I hope is something that will change.  The OECD set out clear objectives and I would like to see the Government taking some of them on board.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, we are supportive of the gender pay gap legislation.  I am unsure as to whether it is still before the D&aacute;il.  I recall that we debated it in the convention centre.  We engaged extensively with it at the Committee on Justice and proposed a series of amendments to it.<\/p>  <p>  We believe that the Low Pay Commission has a vital role to play in tackling inequality and in-work poverty, which disproportionately affects women.  We have seen that in the context of Covid over the past year and a half.  Many of the key roles in the early years sector and healthcare are predominantly filled by women.  They are earning very low pay but doing vital work.  Many of us never took them for granted, but everyone has seen over the past 18 months how valuable their roles are.  While it is important that public discourse shifted in the past few decades and women who smashed glass ceilings are celebrated, there must be a greater focus on the struggles that many women face in reaching even junior management levels and on the gaps that negatively impact on career progression, earnings and pension entitlements.  I have often been struck by the issue of pensions in this context, since it is often women who, due to the cost of childcare, must take parental leave for one or two days per week or give up working outside the home entirely.  They only realise afterwards that doing so has affected their pensions.  Generally, none of us thinks about pensions until later in life.  This is something that affects women.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to take a few minutes to discuss three of the assembly's 45 recommendations that recommend constitutional change in the area childcare.  They recommend a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of childcare over the next decade; increasing the State's spend on childcare from the current 0.37% of GDP to at least 1% by no later than 2030; and paid leave for parents to cover the first year of a child's life, be non-transferable, provide lone parents with the same total leave period as a couple, and be incentivised by increasing payment levels to encourage an increased uptake, which would also be important for lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  The early years and childcare sector has been discussed.  We feel strongly about having a publicly funded model, reducing fees for parents and introducing a decent wage scale for those who work in the sector.  Encouraging women back to work or education is often discussed, but there is not always the infrastructure to support that.  In an early years and childcare survey that I conducted last year, an issue for parents, predominantly women, was that they were locked out of work because of the cost of childcare, childcare spaces not being available or both.  I imagine that the issue of cost is the overriding factor.  While the pandemic shone a light on this sector like never before and how vital it was to the economy probably took some men by surprise, I do not believe that many women were surprised.  Doctors, nurses, retail staff, carers and other vital front-line workers could not get to work because of childcare issues.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the extensive work that the assembly's members, including its chair, have undertaken on behalf of their fellow citizens.  The role they have played in changing Ireland into a better, more inclusive and fairer society for women is commendable and I thank them for that.  As the Minister stated, we must match their commitment by accepting their recommendations and implementing them without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000049#CCC00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1634745120,"counter":439,"content":"<p>The Citizens' Assembly makes excellent observations and recommendations on gender equality and women.  I thank Dr. Catherine Day and the other citizens who took park.<\/p><p>I would like to put the assembly's recommendations in context.  If one were to pick up and smell poverty, homelessness, inequality, the climate and biodiversity crises, and the abduction, rape and murder of girls and women, it would all have the same stink, and that stink is given off by an entitled, privileged and patriarchal elite.  As politicians, we are not meant to be keepers of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  As parliamentarians, we are not meant to be apologists for a patriarchy that in this State has instituted inequality, homelessness, crises in health, housing, caring, childcare and mental health, and poverty.  This is especially important for our daughters.  None of us would be willing to accept for our daughters what we had to take in giving up and giving in - giving up our jobs, our independence, our own incomes and, often, our own names.  For decades, we were forced to give up our children because &quot;acceptable&quot; motherhood was dependent on marriage to a man.  Many women were forced to stay in violent marriages because they no longer had jobs or means of providing for themselves and their children.  I am thinking of LGBT mothers who for decades lived in fear for their safety, their identities and their children because of their sexuality.  Many had to live a lie because if they came out or, worse, were outed, they would lose their children.  Thank God, we have since passed the referendum on marriage equality and we are getting somewhat better.<\/p><p>Today, however, women are still giving up in terms of unequal pay and the exorbitant cost of childcare that is often located miles from where they work or live.  That assumes they can get childcare at all, given that there is a shortage.  If women are pregnant, they are being forced to give up having their partners by their side and to give in to intrusive internal exams while in labour, not for any medical reason, but to ensure that labour is established so that they can get access to their partners.  That is unacceptable.  Maybe women should retire to the pubs and night clubs where it is perfectly safe for their partners to have a pint and themselves to have a dose of oxytocin as well as a bit of gas and air with the bags of smoky bacon crisps.<\/p><p>In here, female Deputies have to give up their right to vote on their constituents' behalf while on maternity leave.  Out there, women are having the living daylights kicked and punched out of them, but their right to a response to their 999 calls is being taken away by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>Despite all of the political razzmatazz on the stage in Dublin Castle and the arms linked in the sunshine, we are still waiting for safe access zones to access an abortion.  <\/p> <p> On the recommendations with regard to women in the home, Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see women having a home.  We are all for that because a home is a basic commodity that women need to prosper.  Women do not want to be camped out with their children in their mothers' back rooms and the infantalisation that brings.  With regard to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and the woman's place being in the home, all of us here know that a woman's place is in the revolution, be it political, social, financial, cultural, spiritual or psychological.<\/p> <p> On the topic of the citizens' assembly, we need a citizens' assembly on reuniting our country and on the deep damage that was done to women through partition.  In our country, North and South, we will never have true equality of citizenship until Ireland is united with dignity, respect and care for all, north, south, east and west. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000049#CCC00400","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634745720,"counter":441,"content":"<p>As of yesterday, more than half of the Sinn F&eacute;in representatives in the Assembly in Stormont are women and the lights are still on and the world has not stopped turning.  Indeed, the work will continue.  This can and will happen in this and other Parliaments and it will be a good thing, a positive thing and something that we should celebrate.  We are not nearly there yet.  There is a huge amount of work yet to be done.  When reading the recommendations of the citizens' assembly, I was struck by how much work remains to be done.  Every year, we have statements on International Women's Day.  You try to not be negative because you want to put the best foot forward and not disrespect those campaigners who have come before you and the tremendous work they have done, but every year on International Women's Day I reflect on how much work we have yet to do.  Pandemics and major world events can sometimes push back that work.  There is a need to look not only at the inequalities faced by women, which is really important, but also, within the gender known as female, the inequalities experienced by people of colour, members of the Traveller community, migrants and those who are marginalised within a marginalised group that ironically enough makes up 51% of our population.<\/p>  <p>  A couple of the recommendations jumped out at me.  The first is the legal right to collective bargaining.  I note that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, did not mention that and neither could he have mentioned every recommendation but the reason he did not mention it is that it is not important to him.  I do not believe it is important to people on the Government benches, but I would like to be persuaded otherwise.  For workers, the union is their voice.  When you are a woman in work and a member of a group that experiences inequality that voice is even more important.  It is vital that we legislate for the legal right to collective bargaining.  We have to give workers the strength and capacity to be vocal in their workplace because things will not change in the workplace.  We will be back here again talking about the gender pay gap.  We might have more information on it, but we will keep coming back to it.  <\/p>  <p>  Likewise, the reference to the right to flexible working, and not the right to request remote working, is a nonsense.  We already have the right to flexible working.  Every worker in the State can ask their boss for flexible working, remote working or blended working.  We can all do that.  What we want is a legal right to have that considered and not refused unless it is an unreasonable request.  Again, the emphasis of the Government is very often on placating the employer and not the worker and what he or she needs.  In this instance, we need a legal right underpinning remote working and flexible working.  Women will say, because disproportionately they do most of the caring, that during the pandemic it fell on them, but they also saw the advantages that could come from remote and flexible working.  It worked for people but now people are being asked to return to the office.  We need that legislated for.  We need to reverse it so that we put the worker at the centre of it, not the employer as is often the case with the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Chair and members of the citizens' assembly for their time, dedication and honesty and for the thoughtful way they approached this work.  They have provided us with a plan and a roadmap.  I hope the Government is listening.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000050#DDD00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1634745720,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The 45 recommendations shine a light on the key issues hampering women's full and free access to and participation in all areas of our economy and society.  This should not be so prevalent in 2021.  We have a long way to go yet.  We know that Covid-19 disproportionately impacted women and, unfortunately, that still is the case.  We know too about the feminisation of poverty.  We have heard that we are on the verge of another recessionary chapter in Ireland.  We know the risk of shecession, that women earn less than men and, in terms of the gender pay gap, that Ireland ranks 18th among the EU 27 member states.  Worse than that, we have a 40% gender pension gap in this State.  Enough is enough.  Our women have suffered and they have been punished enough.  The recommendations to resolve these discrepancies must be heeded by Cabinet in the interests of fairness, equality and in the interests of having a decent society of which we can all be proud.<\/p>  <p>  I stand here today as a young woman whose journey to this very House was not the typical route by any standards.  Some have called it the leap from the dole to the D&aacute;il.  I am still in the maternity stage of my life, by which I mean my children are not fully reared and mothering is still very much a part of my every day life.  Through my experience and my work I am aware of the attitudinal barriers faced by young women, disadvantaged women, lone parent mothers, disabled women, Traveller women and refugee women, in terms of being fully valued and recognised in society.<\/p>  <p>  Childcare, adequate supports for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, maternity leave for all elected representatives, State recognition of care work, closure of the gender pay gap and gender quotas, to name but a few, are the very issues that unless progressed allow for gender inequality to persist.  Many are areas on which Sinn F&eacute;in has been leading the way for years now, which, in part, is the reason I am so proud to be a representative for Sinn F&eacute;in.  In terms of representation, one more female Deputy was returned in general election 2020.  That pace of change is far too slow.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the call for gender quotas and it believes that they should be incrementally increased towards 50%.  Fair is fair and equality is equality.  <\/p>  <p>  An area where there are barriers to full and meaningful participation in politics is that of maternity leave for Oireachtas Members on a legislative footing.  If there is a genuine political will to ensure a full and meaningful participation in Parliament barriers need to be removed.  The lack of explicit provision of support for a pregnant woman or new mother essentially excludes that women from holding office or putting herself forward.  Until such time as we have such provisions and a Parliament that is fully representative of our diverse society, people will, unfortunately, remain unrepresented.  <\/p>  <p>  To speak on gender equality is important for me.  I hope the Cabinet will heed the 45 priority recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, which are critical if we are to give real substance to the phrase \"gender equality\".  Sinn F&eacute;in has been paving the way in terms of many of these recommendations.  As mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, as of this week more than 50% of Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs in the North are female.  That is what equality looks like.  I welcome the expertise and comprehensive research represented in these recommendations and I compel and urge the Government to prioritise their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000050#DDD00300","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speech","time":1634745720,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.<\/p> <p>I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech.  It is really good to see us having this debate.  I was delighted to read the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly in April.  What it has done in setting forward the 45 recommendations is present a visionary manifesto for change and for a society genuinely based on gender equality.  The Minister quoted an open letter from assembly members in which they made clear their intent.  It is inspirational and I join him in acknowledging the immense commitment and work done by the 99 citizens and Dr. Day, as chair of the assembly, in carrying out their task through Covid and adapting so swiftly to the move to working online.<\/p> <p> We in the Labour Party very much support the expeditious implementation of the 45 recommendations.  They set out what is really a social democratic, left-of-centre and feminist vision for change on gender equality.  Equality is central to the Labour Party's political philosophy and political belief system.  I should also say we are very supportive in general of the citizens&rsquo; assembly process, as we were of the constitutional convention which predated it, the establishment of which was originally proposed by the Labour Party in government.  I was proud to chair the Labour Party delegation on the constitutional convention in 2012 and 2013, the recommendations of which paved the way for the holding of the marriage equality referendum in 2015, among other things.  It is a valuable deliberative process to have these assemblies established and maintained in this country.<\/p> <p> I wrote earlier this week about the potential for a new human rights culture to take hold in Ireland as we move through this awful and devastating pandemic.  Assemblies like the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and the constitutional convention are a way for us to move towards a new human rights culture in which the language of rights becomes more mainstreamed and accessible and we move to a new vision for rights that are not just first-generation civil and political rights but move beyond those more limited views of rights to a more substantial form of rights, that is, socio-economic rights which place positive obligations on the State to intervene to provide for greater equality.<\/p> <p> In that regard it is very useful to see what the Citizens' Assembly recommended in terms of the amendment of the Constitution.  The Minister focused on those recommendations as well.  The assembly&rsquo;s recommendation to amend Article 40.1 to refer explicitly to gender equality and non-discrimination builds on similar recommendations made by other expert groups.  We might reflect that the Constitution of the Irish Free State had a guarantee of equality that included the words \"without distinction of sex\", so it was more cognisant of gender as a ground of discrimination and the need to provide specifically against gender discrimination.  That would be a very welcome amendment to include.<\/p> <p> The Minister asked specifically for the views of Members of this House on the second recommendation on amendments to the Constitution, that is, the recommendation that Article 41.2 be amended so the language would be rendered gender neutral.  We might reflect on how extraordinary it is that in 2021 our Constitution still speaks of women as having a \"life within the home\" and of mothers as having \"duties in the home\".  Not only is that absurdly discriminatory towards women and reflects, as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has said, a perpetuation of gender stereotypes but it is also discriminatory against men, who do not have any recognition of their paternal role.  We do not see any reference to fathers and that also needs to be changed.<\/p> <p> There have been many different formulas put forward for changing Article 41.2 and the Minister said he is well aware of the variations that have been proposed.  We came close to the holding of a referendum on deletion of the very gender-specific language.  What happened was, I suppose, a disagreement over what should replace it, if anything.  From my experience in practice and taking constitutional cases, I would simply prefer deletion of the language.  The problem is how one constructs a formula to recognise and support care and care work, as IHREC and the assembly again recommended, without setting up a hierarchy of rights.  If we acknowledge the role of carers, what about the rights of those who are cared for?  We must be so careful, in any constitutional reframing, about setting up hierarchies of rights.  This is an issue on which we will, I hope, have more discussion and debate but it is difficult to see how we construct the very necessary recognition for care and the role of care in our community without creating difficulties.  That is the real challenge.  How do we recognise care in a way that is inclusive and not counterproductive?  It is a debate we will continue to have.<\/p> <p> The third recommendation is a more straightforward one.  It proposes we amend Article 41 to protect family life but with the protection not limited to the marital family.  Just yesterday, the Labour Party published a new Seanad Bill to give entitlement for a widow or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension for a surviving cohabitant in recognition of the glaring discrepancy in our law whereby we do not have recognition for cohabiting couples when one partner dies.  That is a serious issue and was highlighted by the very tragic case of John O'Meara who lost his long-time partner Michelle Batey and who, because they were not married, was not entitled to the same supports a married surviving spouse would have been.  Cohabiting couples account for 150,000 households, 75,000 of them with children.  They are unprotected in the event of family tragedy like that which visited Mr. O&rsquo;Meara.  The Labour Party will also put forward a D&aacute;il motion to change this.  I call on colleagues to support the motion, which will call for an expansion of the definition of family in Article 41 to include families that are not based on marriage.  It is very welcome that we have expanded the definition of marriage but we need also to expand the definition of family, as the Citizens' Assembly has recommended.<\/p> <p> I wish to refer very briefly to some of the other very important issues the assembly has made recommendations on, particularly those on women in politics.  If I were to ask for two changes - and I notice the Minister did not commit to these in his speech - to ensure greater numbers of women participating in politics, the first would be to introduce a statutory right to maternity leave for women elected representatives, while the second would be to introduce quotas for local elections.  Let us do that for the next local elections in 2024.  A report I did for the justice committee in 2009 identified five \"Cs\" as obstacles to women&rsquo;s progression politics, namely, lack of cash, an old boys' culture, lack of childcare, lack of confidence and candidate selection procedures.  We sought to tackle at least some of those five Cs through the 2012 Act and the gender quota, which has been somewhat effective in the elections since, but we still see that the numbers of women Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la are very low by international standards.  My election in July, as only the 37th woman in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann increased our proportion of women to 23%, so we still have a shockingly low level of women in politics.  We need to see more positive action measures.  The two changes to which I referred should be made.  They are both key recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p> <p> I will also speak in support of the assembly recommendations on childcare.  It is unfortunate we did not see anything immediate in the budget to address specifically the cost of childcare for parents.  I acknowledge the very important progress the Minister has made since taking up the portfolio and the progress we saw in the budget but it is still not working for parents, professionals, providers or, indeed, children.  Just today, I got an email from a constituent in Dublin Bay South telling me the cr&egrave;che their child was in had raised the fees substantially on the day the budget was announced.  I know the Minister is proposing a new funding model and I very much welcome any move towards a universal public childcare system but it cannot come soon enough for the parents who are paying so much money for places that are so hard to access, as there is a scarcity of places too.  The Labour Party has called for equal early years policy which would be a Donogh O'Malley moment to move us towards a system where every child in Ireland is guaranteed a free place in childcare.  So much inequality stems from that disadvantage in the early years and we need to tackle that.<\/p> <p> As with so many of the 45 recommendations, the Citizens' Assembly has given us a very clear pathway for change in Ireland.  It is a vision of change towards a society in which women and men are genuinely equal and we can say we are a society in which citizens and all of us resident in this Republic are truly valued as equal in our Republic.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case for far too long.<\/p> <p> I see I am running out of time.  I could say a lot more on the gender pay gap, which I am glad to see we are finally tackling, although again legislation introduced by the Labour Party some years ago on this issue should have been passed by now.  We know that women experience poverty to a greater degree than men.  We need to address the lack of socio-economic rights for women and men in order to achieve a truly equal Republic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000050#DDD00400","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634746920,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the report of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  Dr. Catherine Day and the 99 assembly members should be commended on their work on and dedication to producing this report in the most challenging of circumstances.  Their work may have come to an end but this report marks the beginning, or in some areas the continuation, of our efforts to set Ireland on a path to becoming a world leader in challenging gender-based discrimination in all of its forms.  For many decades, Irish women have often been left behind in our society and this report provides a comprehensive pathway to ensuring that this never happens again.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government is clear in its aim of supporting the principle of equality and ensuring that all citizens can achieve their full potential.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to that this evening.  The Minister will recall that I was in touch with him immediately following the publication of this report to suggest that the Oireachtas establish a special committee to examine these proposals in greater detail.  I understand that the Oireachtas Business Committee has discussed this in recent weeks and that a referral has been made to the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform.  I strongly urge the Minister to push these respective committees to issue a final decision on this proposal.  The recommendations are ready to be presented and debated and there is not a further moment to lose.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister will agree that Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is our fundamental law and a statement of our values as a society.  In recent years, the Irish electorate has helped to bring it up to date with our changing values.  However, to this day there remains a number of outdated and legally meaningless provisions within its pages.  That is why the Citizens' Assembly has recommended three symbolically powerful changes to our Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann does not seek to define the place of men and should not, therefore, seek to define the place of women.  Our Constitution should never narrowly define our roles in society.  In today's modern Ireland, both mothers and fathers carry out important family duties in the home, as do grandparents, siblings, carers and others.  While many parents choose to stay at home to raise their families, we should not discriminate against working parents, working mothers in particular, who make an invaluable contribution to Irish society.  Therefore, I would like to see the anachronistic articles consigned to history.  They do not represent the values and lives of modern Irish women and families.  Moreover, Article 41.2 remains out of date and legally meaningless.  We know full well that there was never an economic rationale behind the marriage bar but 47 years after its abolition, it is ludicrous that the backward thinking of that bar remains enshrined in our Constitution.  <\/p>  <p>  I have said previously in this House that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a scourge in our society.  It is oppressive, abhorrent and inhumane.  The Citizens' Assembly has submitted several interesting recommendations related to combating this pernicious evil.  In particular, the assembly should be applauded for its call to develop guidelines and specialist training for judges and lawyers around the treatment of victims of abuse, including the exclusion of the consideration of sexual history, character and certain medical records from court cases.  Women, or indeed anyone who is subjected to any form of abuse, should not be made to feel as though they are responsible for the harm that has been caused to them.  Our criminal justice system needs to reflect our desire to support victims, not to punish them for no wrong of their own.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned that this report represents the continuation of some of our efforts to challenge gender-based discrimination.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021, which was signed into law in July this year, requires certain companies to publish information pertaining to the difference between hourly pay and bonuses paid to men and women in their employ.  Work is also at an advanced stage to introduce a pension enrolment system which will ensure that many employees will be enrolled into a quality-assured retirement savings system.  In recent weeks, my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Emer Higgins, introduced the Irish Corporate Governance (Gender Balance) Bill 2021, on which I commend her.  The Bill will provide for corporate bodies to maintain a minimum of 40% gender balance on their respective boards and governing councils.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that work is being carried out by this Government to address the very many gaps that exist within our society.  However, the pace of filling these gaps needs to hasten.  After all, gender equality is the unfinished business of the 21st century and I intend to play my part in rewriting the rules when they perpetuate injustice.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, I raise what may seem a trivial matter.  It is difficult sometimes as a woman coming into this Chamber if one is wearing a dress because it is absolutely freezing.  I understand that there are Covid regulations involved but I have been saying this consistently every day and have spoken to my female colleagues about it.  We do not wear suits as a general rule.  We often wear dresses but it is absolutely freezing in here.  I wanted to mention that since we are speaking about gender equality.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to take it into account.  Perhaps he could discuss it with the ushers.  Obviously, I know public safety is of paramount importance but I said I would mention it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000052#FFF00100","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1634746920,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I will certainly take up that matter with the Houses of the Oireachtas Service and see what can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000052#FFF00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1634746920,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I wish to go slightly off script at the beginning and commend the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  When we have statements or a discussion in this Chamber, Ministers and Ministers of State do not generally move outside their ministerial area to comment.  However, the Minister of State has every right to lead the discussion here this evening given the immense courage she showed last July when she stood in the convention centre and declared that she had been a victim of sexual harassment and assault.  I commend her on that.  I said that to her privately but I also wanted to say it on the record of the D&aacute;il.  It takes courage to speak out, whether it is a child calling out a bully in a schoolyard or a woman calling out someone who has perpetrated a sexual assault.  It is important that it is called out each and every time.  It takes immense courage and I say that in all sincerity.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Dr. Catherine Day and all the members of the Citizens' Assembly.  I was very sceptical about the assembly when it was first set up.  I felt that these Houses, the body politic, were where we debate and propose new legislation and act on it.  I felt the assembly was an exercise in kicking the can down the road but it has excelled and done a great job.  I hope it will look at more bodies of work.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak about a number of issues that have not been referenced yet, the first of which is gender poverty.  This is a recurring theme when I hold clinics throughout my county.  A lot of women come to me and tell me they have been left holding the children.  Their husband, boyfriend or partner is gone and pays no maintenance.  I am sure Deputies from all over the country can relate to this.  So many of these women have tried to go through the courts.  They have tried the nice way and the hard way but they are left in a position of gendered poverty because their partner is not paying up.<\/p>  <p>  On the other side of the equation, there are many dads who are not given access to their children.  The child is held back in order to try to leverage money.  It should not happen either way.  There should be a God-given right for a parents to see their child, as long as they do not pose a threat to that child or the other parent but there is also an undisputable moral and legal obligation to support one's child through life until he or she reaches adulthood.  The D&aacute;il needs to do more in that regard because it is still a huge gender issue that has not been dealt with properly by successive Governments.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn now to the issue of political under-representation of women.  I was in a classroom 18 months ago, before I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  There were many girls sitting in front of me each day in fourth class in Parteen National School, many of whom would do a far better job than me in this Chamber in terms of speaking up for themselves, for their gender and for young people overall.  Something happens in the adolescent years.  I do not know if it is a societal or cultural issue but their natural ability recedes.  I do not know how it is dumbed down.  I do not know if it happens within the peer grouping or the education system.  I am not quite sure.  Perhaps it is a cultural issue but sometimes I meet very confident 12-year-olds but they lack that confidence when they get to 18 or 19.  They have dropped out of sport and other activities.  Some of them would make fantastic politicians - far better than me.  I do not want to criticise the other Deputies in Clare but they would probably do a better job than all of us combined, yet they do not engage in public life.  I have long been sceptical of imposed gender quotas and believe there are other barriers we need to remove along the way.<\/p>  <p>  We are very good as a nation at speaking to other countries.  When our Government representatives speak to their counterparts in the Middle East, for example, they reference women's rights.  The time has come when we can no longer shy away from the fact that in some sectors of Irish society, culturally, the woman is still servile in the home.  That is a fact, culturally, in some parts of Irish society.  We need to address what is happening on the home front as well.  Of course, we need to speak up about what is happening in the Middle East but we need to have the backs of Irish women too, of all ethnic groupings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000052#FFF00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1634746920,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I was just thinking as Deputy Cathal Crowe was speaking that the issue of gender equality crosses into so many areas of our lives.  When I was Dublin spokesperson for my party in the previous D&aacute;il, I took a particular interest in cycling.  There is quite a body of literature that shows that particular innovations and infrastructure have to be put in place to enable and encourage more women to cycle.<\/p> <p>It goes to Deputy Cathal Crowe's point that some research indicates that when young girls are cycling it can be seen as more of a male pursuit so they fall out of the habit.  There are things we can do infrastructurally to address this, specifically by separating cycle tracks from the main road.  Women certainly feel an awful lot safer and experience far fewer catcalls and less abuse when that kind of infrastructure is put in place.  I did not think I was going to come in today and talk about cycle lanes in relation to this issue but it gives an indication that to make the experience of cycling in a city equal for everybody, certain things have to be done and certain innovations have to be implemented.<\/p> <p> I must give credit where credit is due.  Some taoisigh pass through their office and leave very little imprint on the public mind.  One of the legacies of former Taoiseach Enda Kenny is the citizens' assembly model.  That was his innovation and it was looked at in a jaundiced way by some Members, although certainly not by myself.  They wondered was the D&aacute;il not a citizens' assembly.  We know that sometimes, the D&aacute;il finds it incredibly difficult to make challenging decisions.  The Citizens' Assembly has enabled the D&aacute;il to do just that on two or three occasions and I hope we follow through as regards the report of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  I also pay tribute to its chairperson, Catherine Day.<\/p> <p> Each of us can ask what have we done to further gender equality.  The issue of political representation has come up.  I am particularly proud to have done everything in my power in my own constituency to promote women at local electoral area level, which is the first step into national politics.  I note that, as a result of me having gone out directly seeking female candidates to run and represent the party at local level, 50% of my party grouping on South Dublin County Council are women.  I do not think my party has replicated that in any other constituency in the country so I am particularly proud of that.<\/p> <p> I am a member of the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight and in the previous D&aacute;il, we recommended including a gender statement in each budget, which the Minister for Finance is now implementing.  We recommended that be done because some of the decisions taken by previous Governments had disproportionate effects on women.  Most notably, some of the measures brought in by the former Minister for Social Protection in 2011 disproportionately affected women over men.  The whole idea behind gender budgeting and equality budgeting is to ensure that, in the future, no measure or policy decision taken by a Minister for Finance can do such a thing.  Every decision on budgets has to be assessed from a gender and equality perspective across the spectrum before they are implemented.<\/p> <p> The issue of universal childcare was mentioned by Deputy Bacik and others.  I agree wholeheartedly with them.  In order for women to access the workplace, and therefore access all the different hierarchical structures in the workplace, universal childcare must be in place.  As part of the next challenge, that must include children with special needs.  Their parents should be afforded exactly the same opportunity as parents of children with no specific special needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000052#FFF00400","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634747520,"counter":450,"content":"<p>The work that was done by the Citizens' Assembly is to be welcomed and its members are to be congratulated for the work they did.  Sinn F&eacute;in made a lengthy submission to the Citizens' Assembly and some of our ideas were represented in the final report.  In the justice portfolio, I come across the issue of gender inequality very regularly, sometimes in relation to people who are before the courts charged with a crime but more often, unfortunately, as victims of crime.  Many women in this city and in many urban areas fear going out after dark.  That is a reflection of our society and is a way in which we have failed women.  They should be encouraged and supported in every way possible to have the freedom of the streets the same as everyone else.  That is something we need to do more about and ensure we put the provisions in place.  There must be sufficient garda numbers to protect and police and ensure that everyone has freedom of movement across our city and everywhere else as well.<\/p>  <p>  Issues of healthcare are regularly mentioned in relation to women's rights and equality, and salary scales and family care arrangements have also been mentioned.  Childcare is something that we have failed with for many years.  For generations it has been accepted that when it comes to caring in our society for some reason or other, whether that be care of the elderly or the young, women are put on the front line and are never rewarded for that or appreciated for it nearly enough.  That is something we need to reflect on and we must change how we work and how we resolve those issues.  While I am sure the Citizens' Assembly's work is going to kick-start some movement, for as long as I can remember we have been getting reports about equality, gender equality, gender rights and women's rights and yet we still have this issue and this problem.  It is very clear that there has to be positive discrimination to ensure we put the resources in place and give the opportunity where it is needed.  Indeed, this is often talked about within politics and there are quotas at the moment for elections to ensure more women get involved in politics and run for election.  I would suggest that they be put up for election in constituencies where they have a chance of winning rather than just being put on the ticket.  That is one of the things that has happened in the past.  Our own party leader is an example of the success of women in politics, and there are many other women in other parties across this House who are strong, authentic voices, not just for women but for the entire society and community.  The work of the Citizens' Assembly is moving us in the right direction and I certainly hope we see the fruitful gains of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000053#GGG00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1634747520,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I also welcome the budget allocation of &euro;500,000 to increase access to community-based drug and alcohol services for women, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community.  However, I ask myself if this Government really understands the depth of the issues facing women in addiction and recovery.  Once again women, the LGBTI community and ethnic minorities are all grouped in together, despite the very different and stark challenges that each of these communities face.  I hope the Government is familiar with the Supporting Women to Access Appropriate Treatment, SWAAT, survey but just in case it is not, it shows that there is a steady rise in the number of women reporting drug and alcohol problems and there are serious concerns about the fact that women are less likely than men to attend treatment services.  Almost all of the women surveyed reported experiencing significant trauma at some point in their lives, including domestic violence, and the report highlighted the lack of supports for women in addiction experiencing domestic violence and other traumas.  Some 82% of the women surveyed were mothers and they feared losing their children.  The barriers these women face will not be addressed by this Government's budget.  The Minister seems to have no plan to begin to remove some of the stigmas or difficulties faced by women in addiction or recovery in this State.  There are community groups doing wonderful work in addressing this but the Government did not listen to these groups, never mind the women themselves.  I am asking the Government to specifically produce a strategy aimed at tackling barriers experienced by women in addiction and recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000053#GGG00300","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1634747520,"counter":452,"content":"<p>The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality has done incredible work cataloguing and making recommendations on a suite of issues that impact on inequity and discrimination concerning gender.  It is important to note at the outset that this is a discussion about how gender affects individuals and groups in society.<\/p> <p>It is not a discussion about women and girls.  However, the patriarchal nature of our society means that it is women and girls who are most frequently disadvantaged.<br\/><br\/>The assembly&rsquo;s report is an outline of many of the key matters that are consistently raised in this House, from the needs of people with disabilities to the cost of childcare and harmful and abusive content on social media.  It should also be noted that there was overwhelming agreement on most of the issues, with many of the recommendations passing by over 90%.  This level of agreement shows that when people are given the time to examine these topics, there is a strong consensus for a fairer society in which public services play a vital role.<br\/><br\/>This report confirmed something that I have often said, which is that most Irish people are social democrats, by which I mean they value the principles of a social democracy that strives for a more equitable society and locates the State as the primary actor to help achieve this in conjunction with civil society.  This report is basically a manifesto for a living wage, publicly funded childcare, improved conditions for carers, better social protection, home care packages for older people and people with disabilities and gender balance in politics, public life and workplaces.  This is a clear, independent barometer for this and future Governments.  It is the yardstick by which actions on equality can be judged.<br\/><br\/>Successive Governments have a mixed track record with following up on the recommendations of citizens&rsquo; assemblies or constitutional conventions.  They have helped progress some of our recent social referendums but equally, the findings on economic, social and cultural rights and extending voting franchises have really been left to individual Oireachtas Members to pursue.  We need, therefore, the Government commitment to act on these recommendations and those of previous assemblies.<br\/><br\/>In my remaining time, I will focus on three of the many items raised in the recommendations, although there are many I would like to discuss.<br\/><br\/>First, on childcare, the assembly recommends that over the next decade, we should move to a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of quality, affordable early years and out of hours childcare, which will be achieved by increasing the State share of GDP spent on childcare from the current 0.37% of GDP to at least 1% by no later than 2030, in line with the UNICEF target.  This funding will make a substantial difference to hundreds of thousands of families across the country.  This is an issue that disproportionately impacts on women who tend either to be childcare professionals or to spend more time at home caring for children.  A SIPTU survey of the childcare sector released earlier this year showed that 90% of childcare workers struggle to make ends meet, 77% have no work sick pay scheme and just 10% received paid maternity leave from their employer.  Many people, primarily women, who are employed in this sector are actively seeking other work.<br\/><br\/>There is a real need to increase the direct State funding to the childcare sector to help improve staff pay and working conditions and increase affordability for parents.  We all know that we will not achieve equality in terms of gender until there is a fully accessible childcare system in this country.<br\/><br\/>The assembly has strong recommendations regarding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It calls for sufficient publicly funded provision of beds, shelters and accommodation for victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and their dependants across the country, in line with the Istanbul Convention.  I have repeatedly raised this exact point.  Under the Istanbul Convention, the State is required to provide one refuge space for every 10,000 people in Ireland.  However, we only provide one refuge space per 10,000 women.  That is, therefore, 50% less than what is recommended to be the bare minimum.  The Department seems content to provide half that amount of refuge spaces due to a clause that refers to other supports.  Clearly, however, its interpretation is incorrect.  The assembly reinforces the need for the proper number of refuge spaces and the report states:<\/p><blockquote>\tnearly 99% were in favour of ensuring that there is sufficient housing and accommodation for victims\/survivors.  The Istanbul Convention recommends one shelter space to every 10,000 people in Ireland. <\/blockquote> <p>It is unambiguous.  We need the Government to fulfil our obligations under the Istanbul Convention immediately.<br\/><br\/>A related recommendation calls for a Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for implementation of a national strategy to prevent and counter domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This reflects the complexity of domestic abuse, which has relevance for the Departments of Health and Housing, Local Government and Heritage just as much as the Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It is one of those cross-cutting issues that needs targeted attention, probably driven by a single person.<br\/><br\/>On this point, I am guided by support organisations and advocates, which have repeatedly called for a dedicated Minister with reach across all those Departments and agencies, with which a survivor may interact, in addition to a Cabinet standing committee.  We need this leadership to drive the necessary transformative change to provide integrated support, on-the-ground specialists and preventative strategies.  I suggest that the new committee looking at these recommendations would focus on this role, which may be a Minister of State - I am not sure - but someone whose sole responsibility is driving a far-reaching strategy on domestic and sexual violence.<br\/><br\/>It is also important to say that a number of sub-recommendations on victim support and reforms of our court systems are under way.  This is incredibly welcome but we must still be aware of the considerable barriers that victims and survivors face in even considering reporting these crimes.  Two weeks ago, Rape Crisis Network Ireland revealed that there has been a 22% increase in helpline calls during the pandemic and that over the past decade, there was a 100% increase in calls.  Women, children and men are all reaching out.  The assembly&rsquo;s findings are a fresh call to re-double our efforts in response.<br\/><br\/>Third, there are direct recommendations on stereotypes in education and the media, highlighting the need for our education system and media advertising to promote gender diversity.  I am a strong believer in the idea that you have to see it to be it.  We need to ensure that children and young people have a selection of role models to help them develop.<br\/><br\/>As the assembly recommends, this means strengthening existing programmes to encourage women into male-dominated careers and developing initiatives to encourage men into female-dominated careers.  The latter point is often overlooked.  We probably all know men who would have been incredible nurses, therapists or secretaries and perhaps would have been, had social norms facilitated them in pursuing these careers.<br\/><br\/>The conclusions on media and advertising are also significant as this is an incredibly influential area with little oversight.  The assembly has called for stronger regulations to promote gender equality and avoid gender discrimination and stereotyping and take action where discriminatory behaviours occur.  This is very relevant when we consider the work of the Why Not Her collective, of which I am sure the Minister has heard.  This work has shown that up until recently, a person is more than five times more likely to hear an Irish male artist than an Irish female artist on Irish radio.  The collective's monitoring of gender disparity on Irish radio revealed that issue and, even more importantly than revealing the issue, its work has resulted in some of the stations consciously changing this pattern.  Over the past year, therefore, for the top 20 most played songs by Irish artists, some stations have gone from 0% women on the top 20 most played list, to be specific, to more than 20%.  Therefore, we need this trend to continue.  When similar research was conducted in the UK, stations changed their practices and confronted their bias.  Like I said, some Irish radio stations have begun to consciously support Irish women artists and we need the rest to follow.  We need the industry and the Government to work together to give these talented artists airplay.<br\/><br\/>Representation matters.  What we see online, on television and in schoolbooks really shapes our understanding of the world.  For children, it influences career choices.  We need to make more opportunities available to more young people.<br\/><br\/>In closing, I note that this item is being covered today due to the determination of a number of Members, mainly Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  The recommendations were published in June and these matters should have been discussed long before the budget.<br\/><br\/>I call for the forthcoming new committee on gender equality to have members from all political groupings given the importance of matters it will consider.  I request that all groups, especially the larger parties, ensure that they have sufficient numbers of male representatives on the committee.  As I said, gender does not mean it is just a women and girls issue.  There are distinct gender patterns on our Oireachtas committees at the moment reflecting those kinds of societal stereotypes, from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which have only one female member - there are no female Deputies on the agriculture committee - to the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which has a majority of female members.  It is somewhat similar on the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<br\/><br\/>In terms of gender equality in Ireland in general, one of the sad realities is that when we gained independence as a country, that is when things really went south for women for gender equality.  I did not actually mean the pun when I said, &quot;going south&quot;.  I cannot speak for all women but I know that most of us are also proud to be Irish and to have that independence.  It is kind of a horrible feeling when one thinks about the reality of happened for us when we got independence.  It really is time to change that.  We have the Citizens' Assembly report now.  What we require is the political will to change this and I really hope that exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000053#GGG00400","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634748720,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to highlight some of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  Gender equality is often mislabelled as a woman's issue, but it is not.  It is a societal issue and a goal on which every Member of this House ought to be focused.  The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality makes a number of recommendations, spanning from politics and childcare to pay and media and each recommendation has weight and possibility for change behind it.<\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly is to enact gender quota legislation which requires private companies to have at least 40% gender balance on their boards.  I am pleased to say this is a recommendation I have set in motion.  Earlier this month, I introduced the Irish Corporate Governance (Gender Balance) Bill 2021, which will seek to introduce a 40% gender balance quota in the boardroom.  Last year, women accounted for just 22.4% of board members in Irish listed companies.  That is shocking when the evidence shows gender balance is better for business.  It is better when it comes to performing financially.  It is my ambition that this Bill will deliver on the Citizens' Assembly recommendation; become landmark legislation and create opportunity for both men and women to be fairly represented at the top table of business and ultimately, to achieve better balance in the boardroom.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for her comments, for endorsing my Bill and for all she has done to shine a light on victims of sexual assault.  The Citizens' Assembly made a number of recommendations on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  These included appointing a victims and survivors commissioner; covering power dynamics, consent and domestic violence within a revised relationship and sexuality curriculum and developing guidelines and specialist training for judges and lawyers on the treatment of victims, including the exclusion of sexual history, character, attire and counselling or medical records in cases.<\/p>  <p>  We already know that since the beginning of the pandemic, incidences of domestic violence have spiralled and last week, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, confirmed the sharp rise last year in case files concerning domestic violence has continued into this year.  The Citizens' Assembly's recommendations on the treatment of victims or survivors in a courtroom setting is especially relevant.  Of course, we need to make sure we are preventing sexual, domestic and gender-based violence through increased education and I support a revised relationship and sexuality commitment.  However, when sexual assaults come before a judge, which is a long road in itself, we must ensure - we owe it to survivors of these crimes - that their character, relationship history, personal medical records or indeed their wardrobe are not subjected to offensive and damaging scrutiny.  It is time these factors, which are still often used in court cases dealing with sexual offences, are ended.  When someone's wallet is stolen, we do not think it relevant to ask the person what he or she was wearing when it happened.  Survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based crimes should be afforded that same dignity.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the recommendation to set targets in legislation to reduce the hourly gender pay gap.  The gender pay gap in Ireland is 14%, which effectively means women are working for free from the beginning of November until the end of each year.  It is a reflection of how we value men and women in society but it is not a reflection of the value women bring to the workplace.  The Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021 will begin to address this systemic problem.<\/p>  <p>  Introducing maternity leave for all elected representatives is also a recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly and this is an issue the Government was forced to face earlier this year when the Minister, Deputy McEntee, had her baby boy.  We all agree it is wholly unsuitable to be rushing decisions to make these kinds of important topics relevant.  It is a knee-jerk reaction and it sends the wrong message about the place of women in government and the heights they should expect to reach in their political career.  All elected representatives need the security of knowing they will be able to take maternity leave should they need it.<\/p>  <p>  This should be a priority of the Government, because, it speaks to the lack of women entering politics and the lack of women in this Chamber.  Safety, be that online, on our streets or outside our own homes, can be a real concern for both women and men in politics and we have an opportunity to act cross-party and united to tackle and change that and prevent it from escalating in order that it does not put women off entering politics.  Greater gender balance in politics would have a positive impact on every recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.  Simply by having more women in the room where policy and legislative decisions are being made, we can make better decisions and have more inclusive impacts on our society as whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000055#JJJ00100","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1634748720,"counter":455,"content":"<p>We are rightly proud of much of the progress we have made in Ireland over the past several decades and especially in the past decade.  We have seen positive and inclusive social progress made and at a pace which has surprised many.  However, despite this progress, we face a continued battle to achieve full inclusivity and equality within our society.  This is true of many minorities and groups but also applies to the largest population group in the country which is, of course, women.  The regrettable truth is sexism and gender bias has been allowed to fester and spread throughout every aspect of our society for far too long.<\/p>  <p>  The pervasive and insidious nature of sexism has resulted in a situation in which every woman in Ireland can recount multiple experiences in which they felt physically or verbally harassed or were made to feel uncomfortable in their working environment; took a longer route home for fear of their personal safety or avoided public transport at night.  This happens on a daily basis.  It is happening in workplaces, restaurants and pubs.  It is happening in the home and has happened on the street.  The tragic reality is it happens far too often, so that many women do not even report it or speak of it and choose not to follow up on it.  No one should have to endure these unsolicited and unacceptable encounters in this way.<\/p>  <p>  To tackle the scourge of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, we must build a broad coalition.  Men, especially, must do better and must call out this behaviour when they see it.  We, as men, must not tolerate the casual harassment or comments passed by other men about women.  These women are mothers, daughters, sisters and wives.  They should not have to tolerate the behaviour of men who act in a way which is abhorrent to the decency within society.<\/p>  <p>  Education will play an important role in this effort.  Introducing extensive education programmes on consent, harassment and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be a positive step.  I am pleased the Citizens' Assembly has recommended this form part of the review of the relationship and sexual education curriculum in schools.  In quarter 1 of next year, we will begin with the junior cycle.  Some universities have already begun such models on campuses.  This should be increased throughout all levels of higher education.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is working to ensure these programmes become a regular part of university life.<\/p>  <p>  The assembly has also highlighted the importance of other recommendations, among them, the removal of Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, commonly referred to as the women in the home article.  Section 2 of this article refers to the need for the State to ensure mothers shall not engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.  It is jarring that in 2021 such a sentiment remains in our Constitution.  While the removal of this article will not act as a silver bullet for this problem, it is yet another example of the casual and everyday sexism to which women are subjected.<\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased the role of technology companies has been highlighted in the recommendations.  The spreading of private images and the malicious nature of persistent harassment, bullying and other forms of abusive behaviour have no place on the Internet nor in society.  These activities must be removed without delay by the technology companies involved and we in this House must hold those companies to account and ensure they are doing all they can to remove content such as this and indeed social media users who engage in this sort of activity.<\/p> <p>The assembly has called for specialist training of judges and lawyers with regard to the treatment of victims which includes the exclusion of their sexual history, their clothing or, indeed, their character, as Deputy Higgins so eloquently put it.<\/p> <p> While there are positive developments being led by Government, such as the forthcoming publication of these third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, the Gender Pay Gap Information Act and, indeed, the recently introduced and mentioned Private Members&rsquo; Bill by my colleague, Deputy Higgins, are reminders that there is a considerable body of work that remains to be done.  It will take years to complete, but it must be done.  We must be bold and consistent in our efforts to root out gender inequality and everyday sexism in our society.<\/p> <p> The scourge of domestic violence tears at the fabric of our society and has profound ramifications for the victims and those close to victims.  In 2020, there was a 17% increase in the number of domestic violence calls to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This constitutes an average of 120 calls per day, totalling 43,500 calls over 2020 alone.  Sadly, this number does not represent the full extent of domestic violence, as many cases go unreported and victims suffer in silence and in despair.<\/p> <p> Similarly, a report carried out last year by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, highlighted the experience of women on public transport.  It showed that one in three has been physically harassed on public transport; 55% of women avoid public transport at night; and 47% of women take a longer route home while walking due to safety concerns.  The report is filled with statistics such as these.  It is a damning look at an issue that has been too long ignored by society as a whole.  I recently witnessed vile comments being used on a DART one evening.  A group of young men used language aimed at a woman who was leaving the train which had no place in either private or public discourse.  It is a disturbing event that should not have taken place.  The individual who chanted these phrases did so in the safety of his own group of friends, and with a sense of impunity.  It was the truest form of toxic masculinity aimed at a lone woman.  While this is an overt scenario, it speaks to the attitude of acceptance of some men - too many men - with regard to this kind of behaviour.  I refer to the quiet language of the nod and wink, or a whistle as a woman passes, or worse still the cat-call from scaffolding at a college student on her way to a lecture in the morning, when dressed in jeans and a hooded top, heard the words, \"Walk of shame, love\" as she passed.  There is a resulting feeling of uncomfortableness and fear for those women.  That instance, incidentally, was not in this jurisdiction but it is still valid. <\/p> <p> I have spoken many times on the need to build an inclusive, progressive and sustainable society.  We can do this if all people feel safe and if everyone, regardless of their race, orientation or gender are treated equally.  We must do all that we can to realise a truly modern Ireland and to build on the progress of the past.  We must support women and minorities to rise up in business, politics, education and every other aspect of society, so that they can live the lives they choose without undue barriers being placed in their way for no other reason but the gender they were born as.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000055#JJJ00200","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634749320,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I welcome this report and its recommendations.  Many of the recommendations reflect what we in Sinn F&eacute;in have calling for on a range of issues.  First, I welcome the decision to delete Article 41 and to replace it with non-gender specific references to care.  It is estimated today that family carers in Ireland number in excess of 500,000 people.  Our carers do incredible work looking after family members who are elderly, ill or who have a disability.  It is estimated that they save the State &euro;20 billion every year and yet they often feel forgotten about, ignored or taken for granted and, in many cases, worthless.  Any recommendation that would oblige the State to take reasonable measures to support care in the home and in the community is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with and welcome the many other recommendations around carers, such that paid carers should have proper pay scale, pension entitlements, and a career structure.  The income disregard for the carers&rsquo; allowance needs to be increased.  An important clause recommends the reimbursement of the costs associated with caring, which is pertinent.  The number of hours that a carer can work or pursue education in conjunction with caring should be increased, as recommended here.  In fact, carers should be trusted to police this provision themselves.  The report also recommends improved respite provision for carers.  It is important that we care for the carers.  Many of them are suffering with mental health issues due to a lack of support and adequate breaks.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations on childcare again echo our policy.  It puts forward proposals that there should be a publicly funded form of childcare.  This will not cannot happen unless the State starts to invest in childcare and spends at least 1% of GDP on childcare provision.  Older people and disabled people need to be supported to live in their community independently.  There should be personalised budgets based on the individual&rsquo;s level of need.  People need to be able to make choices about how to live their lives.  They must be treated with respect and listened to.  A statutory right to home care is essential.  While it is included in the programme for Government, it needs to be implemented without delay.  <\/p>  <p>  The idea that somebody is still referred to as a &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo; today is archaic.  The fact that 90% of qualified adults are women comes as no surprise.  Women account for only 33% of those in receipt of full State contributory pension, even though women outnumber men among the over 65s.  Only 28% of women of pension age have an occupational private pension compared to 55% of men.  Older, rural-based women are even less likely to have an occupational or contributory pension.  On average, women have 29% less pension income than men.  Approaches that tie the pension system more closely to employment and earnings exacerbates, rather than mitigates, gender inequalities, as well as intersecting with inequalities and discriminations experienced by disabled women, carers, lone parents, Traveller women, and other women who encounter barriers to the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the State has a responsibility to remedy the inequality experienced by women affected by the marriage bar, as supported in the recommendations of the citizens&rsquo; assembly.  It is past time that any adult, male or female, should be described as a &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo;.  Every individual should be entitled to a social protection payment in their own right in this day and age, especially when awareness of domestic violence and coercive control should be commonplace.  Every effort needs to be made to ensure that all adults have independent means.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo; payment is generally paid the primary claimant, unless the claimant and the qualified adult agree otherwise.  This increases the qualified adult&rsquo;s financial dependency.  In the case of qualified adults living with an abusive partner, this financial dependency makes it harder for women to seek support or access services and possibly leads to violence.  Moreover, the lack of access to independent income contributes to the ongoing financial abuse of the woman and any children while in that relationship.<\/p>  <p>  A universal basic income scheme where no one is living below the poverty line is an excellent recommendation.  It should be taken seriously.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the figures on female participation in politics and on boards in Ireland are startling.  While I support gender quotas in politics, until certain political parties take it seriously, nothing is going to change.  However, some parties are no longer as dominant as they were, so the problem may be overcome anyway.  It is unbelievable that 38% of Irish companies have no females on their leadership teams.  I believe sporting organisations need to do a lot more.  They are making some effort to promote women in sport.  Things have improved but they have a long way to go.  I commend the report and its recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000056#KKK00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1634749320,"counter":458,"content":"<p>We now move to People Before Profit-Solidarity.

She was told that it was a case of boy meets girl and that there was nothing to investigate.  We know that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, was of little use, and so far the Taoiseach has also been of no help.  This pattern of State harassment and State violence against women, and minimising and ignoring it, is not an isolated incident.  A well-known US study found that police officers are 15 times more likely to be perpetrators of domestic violence than the general population.  An incredible 40% of them self-reported as having perpetrated domestic violence in the previous year.  For some, it is a small step or not a step at all from enforcing the legal violence used by the capitalist state to protect the private property of the rich, mostly against marginalised groups such as those suffering from addiction or homelessness, to taking the step to beating their partner in the home, or even to preying on women in the course of their police work as we saw in the brutal murder of Sarah Everard.  Channel 4 News in England recently reported that one woman a week is now coming forward with complaints of domestic abuse by police officers.  Every woman spoken to by Channel 4 said that the police failed to investigate their own.  Perhaps that is not surprising for a police force in which the murderer of Sarah Everard was casually nicknamed &quot;The Rapist&quot; by his colleagues.<\/p><p>What is the situation here?  In the past few months, we have learned the barring orders have been taken out against at least 21 serving garda&iacute; since 2019.  Nine of those garda&iacute; are under investigation for alleged breaches of the barring orders and five for alleged coercive control.  This follows from revelations that garda&iacute; cancelled more than 3,000 999 calls from women in distress, seeking assistance from the State to protect them from domestic violence in their own homes.  Even in instances where victims of domestic violence got a response, an internal Garda investigation found that in some cases they failed to follow procedures for dealing with such cases and that they did not make further checks, either phone calls or visits, to the victim in the days that followed.  This is the Irish version of <i>A Rapist in Your Path<\/i>where agents of the State, the ones who are supposed to protect women from violence, are often the worst perpetrators of gender-based violence and are complicit in covering it up.<\/p><p>I have some brief points on the abortion law review.  The fundamental right of bodily autonomy is a necessary starting point for any possibility of gender equality.  Until recently, that was completely denied to women in Ireland, courtesy of the eighth amendment.  The magnificent mass movement for repeal culminated in a resounding two thirds majority vote in favour of legislating for access to abortion on 25 May 2018.  Since then, thousands of pregnant people have legally accessed abortion care in this country but it remains the case that a substantial minority of women are still forced to travel to Britain.  Last year, at the height of the Covid pandemic, almost 200 women were forced to travel and 375 were forced to travel the year before.  One third had received a devastating diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality but were refused abortion care here.  One of the main reasons it is still happening is that section 23 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 criminalises doctors who get a diagnosis wrong and perform an abortion outside the provisions of the Act, with a prison sentence of up to 14 years.  This draconian clause is having a serious chilling effect.  <i>The Journal<\/i>reported earlier in the year that 85% of pregnancy people who came to the advocacy group for help with terminations for medical reasons still ended up having to travel for a termination, many of them for abnormalities commonly recognised as fatal.<\/p><p>The forthcoming review of the Act must address this injustice by decriminalising abortion, removing the chilling effect on doctors, and legislating for the right to choose, in full, without any term limits.  One of the mottos of the repeal campaign was &quot;Trust Women&quot;.  We need to do this not only as the best way of assisting pregnant people faced with devastating decisions about fatal foetal abnormalities and foetal anomalies but to help all women who need abortion care.  Only they can make the right decision for them.<\/p><p>A second major issue with the 2018 Act is the ridiculous, patronising and damaging three-day wait period for abortion care.  It treats women like airheads incapable of knowing their own minds from one day to the next.  Its sole reason for existing is as a sop for misogynistic anti-choicers.  It must go in the review.  As with all restrictions on abortion, this has the worst impact on marginalised women who may struggle to attend repeated, unnecessary medical appointments.  This includes women suffering domestic violence, migrant women, young women, single parents with no one to mind their kids, and women living in many areas in this country without abortion access.<\/p><p>A final issue is the failure of the Government to introduce promised legislation on safe access zones to prevent the harassment by anti-choice zealots of women accessing abortion services and of women simply attending GPs or maternity hospitals.  Earlier this week, I stood with activists from Together for Safety, along with many others, to demand that this legislation proceed as a matter of urgency.  That must also be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000057#LLL00100","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1634749920,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I will start by saying a few words about femicide.  In Northern Ireland, 11 women have been murdered since the lockdown in March 2020.  Imagine if there had been 11 sectarian murders in the same period.  It would be all over the news and, having been all over the news, the whole island would be talking about it.  If it was because of which community you came from, it would be a significant news item, but when it is because of your gender, it is a different story.  There is talk about violence against women being the shadow pandemic, hiding in the shadows and in plain sight.  The corporate media have a role to play here.  Why is there not more of a light being shone on this?  For example, we recently saw an edition of the television show \"Living With Lucy\", featuring Paul Gascoigne, Gazza, a great footballer.  I admired his skills with my mouth open on many occasions.  He is one of the most talented of his generation anywhere in the world.  Gazza was also responsible for years of violence against his ex-wife.  The television show featured his life after football, his battle with alcohol, and his use of Botox.  There was nothing about the years of violence.  Should it have dominated the programme?  No, I do not think so.  Should it have featured somewhere?  Yes.  It cannot have been that the programmers were not aware of that history.  His ex-wife Sheryl is a well-known campaigner on the issue.  It is an example of how the media fail to shine a spotlight on these issues.  I support the recommendations from the assembly regarding violence against women, including about relationships and sexuality education, RSE, training and so on.  When will the Government implement them?<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I have a word for the woke capitalists on the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party benches.  When are we going to have a new sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report?  The last sexual abuse and violence in Ireland report was in 2002, 19 years ago.

The assembly has become an important part of our democratic process.  Yet again, it has produced a nuanced representation of the state of gender inequality.  I thank everybody who was involved in the assembly vote, both men and women.  Sometimes men feel excluded from this debate or they feel that we need to be defensive in responding to the debate.  This is an issue, like all inequality issues, which disproportionately impacts women.  It eats away at all of society like all inequality does.  Very few men have felt unsafe walking home at night or been widely discriminated against with regard to opportunities.  That male privilege sometimes needs to be set aside in reacting.  It also needs to be harnessed in order to deliver the change that is needed.  Representation and political participation were key recommendations.  There are so many in this that you could have a debate on each one of the recommendations.  As the Fianna F&aacute;il councillor liaison, I want to talk specifically about local government.<\/p> <p>There are ten constituencies in the D&aacute;il that are represented entirely by male Deputies.  At local authority level, women make up only one quarter of all councillors and the level of mismatch between male and female representation varies widely between different geographic areas.  That is bad for politics and unfair for women.  The recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality provide a pathway to removing some of those big barriers.<\/p> <p> Maternity and paternity leave need to be more available, particularly to local elected councillors.  Many female councillors have contacted me on this and have made a keen effort to resolve it.  Currently, a councillor requires their local authority to pass a resolution to allow them an absence based on illness.  We know pregnancy is not an illness and this is unacceptable, inadequate and insulting to women.  Female and male partners of councillors who are having a child also have no right to extended leave without taking a similar hit in their income.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, report.  It has done huge work on this issue.  The proposals for paid paternity leave it published earlier this year will inform the ongoing work of the Government.  I urge the Government to implement this legislation as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> The introduction of leave for parents is only one part of the wider change which is needed in local government.  Remote attendance and hybrid meetings should become a permanent feature as we enter post-pandemic life.  This has been a transformative measure for parents of young children in attending council meetings, as it has in all walks of life.  We need to be far more ambitious in regard to remote working and home working, both for climate action and for the societal benefits they deliver.  The potential of remote work must be harnessed and facilitated where possible and I welcome the steps the Government has taken with the national remote working strategy and the incentives provided in budget 2022.  Actually, they are not incentives but a recognition of the costs.  Perhaps there should be greater incentives.<\/p> <p> The area of childcare is vital in encouraging full participation of women.  The cost of childcare is crippling many families.  It limits the choices of both parents, who each have responsibilities, if childcare arrangements are not in place.  Fees regularly cost more than a mortgage and present a significant barrier to both parents being able to work. <\/p> <p> My children are now ten and 12 and for almost the entire time I served in local government we had to arrange for different forms of childcare.  I have calculated that we must have spent more than &euro;100,000 of post-tax income to facilitate childcare.  My brother reckons he spent north of &euro;120,000 over that decade.  It is an incredible cost.  No amount of tax incentives will be able to meet that but a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of childcare will.  I welcome the investment in the sector in the recent budget and I believe it is the beginning of realising what this report talks about, the targets set out in it for childcare and the contribution it can make to ending inequality.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the childcare system and create one that supports the staff working in it.  In many cases, those staff are disproportionately women and the low pay levels have an impact on them.  The introduction of a universal childcare scheme is welcome but we have a long way to go.<\/p> <p> This report is incredibly ambitious and needs to be met with a similar level of ambition from Government, public agencies and public life.  I encourage all those watching the debate to examine the report and see how they can take up the challenge of ending gender inequality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021102000057#LLL00300","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1634750520,"counter":467,"content":"<p>In her inaugural address in December 1990, Mary Robinson declared: &quot;As a woman, I want women who have felt themselves outside history to be written back into history, in the words of Eavan Boland, 'finding a voice where they found a vision'&quot;.  President Robinson was acknowledging that her landmark election owed a great deal to stalwarts of feminism like Eavan Boland and M&aacute;ire Mhac an tSaoi, people who had been writing women back into history and the female experience back into Irish society.  In a week when we have lost extraordinary figures in Irish culture, we would do well to acknowledge the role of the feminist pen in the line drawn from the election of Ireland first woman President to the work completed by the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality.  As a result of that work, we have 45 clear recommendations to better our society for all our citizens.  Just as gender inequality shadows all aspects of our society, these recommendations span sectors with key recommendations for leadership and politics, social protection and education, and tackling pay disparity and domestic violence.<\/p><p>I offer my thanks to the members of the citizens' assembly for their work.  They have proved again, through the power of the process, the value of deliberative democracy.  As with the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Climate Change, informed and nuanced discussion can and should underpin policy-informed decision-making in the work of Government.  As we face a range of enormous challenges in housing, pension reform, social inequalities and our climate and biodiversity emergency, this deliberative democracy model can help us plot a path forward, regardless of where Twitter polls or newspaper surveys with leading questions may try to deflect.  Where social media and clickbait headlines serve to polarise, inclusive and informed debate serves to unify.  If we are to address and overcome the enormous challenges ahead and bring our citizens with us on that arduous road, that in-depth and considered engagement is essential. <\/p><p>The carefully considered recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality provide us with clear directions towards a better and fairer society.  While a special Oireachtas committee is being set up to comprehensively address the recommendations, it is worth noting work has already begun.  In the short life of this Government, we have begun to take some of the necessary steps to address gender inequality, reflecting a number of the key recommendations from the citizens' assembly.  In the recent budget, the Minister introduced ground-breaking funding for the childcare sector, designed to deliver quality and affordable childcare for children and their parents and stability for childcare providers.  It is the start of a multi-annual investment programme, which will achieve real and practical improvements in people's lives.  There will be an extension of the universal subsidy available under the national childcare scheme to all children under 15, which will allow all children availing of early learning and childcare to receive a subsidy to offset the often eye-watering childcare fees.  It will also see a cessation of the practice of deducting hours spent in preschool or school from the entitlement to the national childcare scheme subsidised hours.  This is of particular benefit to children from low income families whose parents are not in work or study.  The Minister also announced an additional two weeks' leave and benefit to the current five weeks of parent's benefit, which can be taken during the first two years of a child's life or, in the case of adoption, within two years of the placement of the child with family. <\/p><p>These steps forward demonstrate this Government's commitment to improving access to childcare, barriers which compound existing gender inequalities in our society.  They are steps forward on a path to gender inequality and achieving one of the key recommendations of the citizens' assembly to move to a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of childcare over the next decade.  <\/p><p>  I have spoken numerous times in this House on the United Nations sustainable development goals, SDGs, and how they set out a path to a more just sustainable and better future for us all.  Goal 5 is particularly germane to this debate in that it focuses on gender equality.  However, progress on this goal requires strong progress for girls and women across every SDG, including those related to quality education, reduced inequalities, decent work and economic growth and others.  Similarly, the key recommendations of the citizens' assembly recognises the need to ensure our societal structures provide a level playing field for all genders.<\/p><p>Another key recommendation in the report is in the area of leadership in the workplace.
