The suspension was based on the protection of local communities as well as that of the peacekeepers during the Covid pandemic.     <\/p>  <p>  The UN directed that only in certain very limited and extenuating circumstances would any exemption be allowed. This was only where a rotation was vital to maintain a critical operational capability and where the requisite quarantine requirements for incoming and rotating contingents required by the UN and the host state can also be guaranteed.  Any such exemption was subject to a decision by the UN Headquarters in New York on a proposal from the Force Commander.  <\/p>  <p>  Immediately upon the direction of the UN Secretary General, the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and the Department Foreign Affairs and Trade engaged with the UN in the mission areas and at UN Headquarters, though both informal and formal contacts to ensure that the rotation of Irish personnel would be achieved as close as possible to the scheduled dates.  <\/p>  <p>  On foot of these efforts, rotations to UNDOF, MINUSMA, KFOR and EUTM Mali have been successfully concluded to date. The Department and the Defence Forces are currently progressing options to rotate 2 personnel deployed to the MONUSCO mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<\/p>  <p>   However, from the outset, the key focus has been on UNIFIL. As our largest mission, it involves the rotation of a significant number of personnel in two stages, is thus more complex, and requires approvals and permissions from both the UN and from the Host State, not least in terms of their health status and that of the local population in a time of a global pandemic health restrictions.   <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the process laid down by the UN Secretary General, a submission was made by the Defence Forces through the Senior Irish Officer to the UNIFIL Force Commander seeking an exemption.  The Chief of Staff both wrote to and spoke to the Force Commander.  In tandem with this, the Department of Foreign Affairs through our Permanent Mission in New York engaged with UN Headquarters at senior level.  <\/p>  <p>  I can now advise that the UN has agreed to an exemption of the suspension for Ireland which will allow Ireland to rotate its full contingent to UNIFIL during the UN moratorium.  The first rotation has now been confirmed by the UN for 21 June and the second for 29 June.<\/p>  <p>  As the dates for the rotations have now been confirmed by the UN, I hope that this will now ease the impact of the delayed reunion with families.  The confirmed dates have been communicated by the military authorities to Defence Forces personnel coming home and those going out to Lebanon to commence their deployment.   <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with agreed arrangements, the United Nations will be responsible for making the transport arrangements for the rotation of UNIFIL troops in June.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700112#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1619"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Equipment","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700112#WRB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[7120\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700112#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the estimated full year cost of purchasing 15 extra combat support service armoured 8 x 8 drop vehicles for the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>My priority as Minister with Responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The capital allocation for Defence is &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million on the National Development Plan 2019 allocation.  The NDP - Project Ireland 2040 - provides financial allocations for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that Ireland's ongoing active participation in a range of peacekeeping and crisis management missions is a key policy requirement. While each mission has elements of danger, it is the Government's position that all actions should be taken to minimise threats to the safety of personnel. Armoured vehicles provide essential force protection and, in this context in accordance with the equipment planning process, the fleet of armoured vehicles is subject to regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  Twenty four (24) 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in late 2017. A multi-year mid-life upgrade of the Army's fleet of MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers is underway which will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. To date, thirty eight (38) upgraded vehicles have been delivered, with the remainder due by early 2022. In addition in 2018 the Defence Forces took delivery of ten (10) new armoured logistic vehicles at a cost of &euro;7.1m including VAT. These measures will provide essential force protection for personnel overseas. <\/p>  <p>  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a requirement for additional 4x4 armoured utility vehicles has been identified and subject to consideration of a business case and assessment of associated cost, funding will be made available.

As such, it is not possible to estimate accurately the cost of such vehicles in the absence of a relevant specification and market assessment which, as indicated, does not currently arise<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700112#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1619"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700112#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[7316\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700112#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the Napoleonic battery fortress on Carrig Island, Ballylongford, County Kerry was taken into the ownership of his Department after independence (details supplied) in view of the fact the land on which it is situated is not registered with the Property Registration Authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 28 of 20 May 2020.

However, the impact of the virus is likely to fall hardest on communities already experiencing humanitarian crises, displacement, or weak health systems. <\/p>  <p>  The situation in Syria is particularly worrying. Nine years of civil war have decimated the country&rsquo;s health care system and left Syria poorly equipped to face COVID-19. Testing capacities are limited and there are significant shortages of personal protective equipment. <\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 requires a collective, coordinated, global response.  Ireland's priority is to provide vital support to the multilateral system's efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the most vulnerable countries, on the basis that &ldquo;nobody is safe until everybody is safe.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organisation, part of the UN system, is at the centre of that global response, working to control the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact. Recognising the WHO's important role, Ireland was the first country to contribute to the WHO COVID-19 appeal.  This appeal has since been rolled into the UN Global Humanitarian Response Plan, which aims at a coherent response across the UN system to COVID-19.  Ireland is also part of Team Europe, the EU's response to the pandemic.  That collective response, focusing on global leadership and unity, remains at the heart of Ireland's approach.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s funding to the WHO&rsquo;s COVID-19 appeal has been allocated at the global level, allowing the WHO to prioritise additional resources wherever needs are greatest. As with all humanitarian funding, Ireland and other donors insist that these resources are allocated on the basis of need alone, and in line with the humanitarian principles of independence, impartiality, neutrality and humanity. This means that in Syria, those in need should receive assistance, whether they are in Government or opposition controlled areas. <\/p>  <p>  As well as the additional needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is vital for donors to continue to support the millions of people who remain in need of humanitarian assistance, and those needs are acute in Syria. Ireland will provide over &euro;24 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis in 2020. This will bring our overall contribution to more than &euro;168 million since 2012, our largest response to any single crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[7408\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding renewing passports; if there are delays; the average waiting times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>With the commencement of the COVID-19 public health emergency and the introduction of widespread travel restrictions both nationally and internationally, Irish citizens have ceased nearly all non-essential travel.

The European Commission is expected to present proposals for a revised MFF and a Recovery Fund linked to the MFF shortly. This revised MFF with a Recovery Fund will be the fourth pillar of the EU&rsquo;s economic response to the pandemic. The first three pillars agreed by the Eurogroup and endorsed by the European Council on 23 April are the SURE guarantee for unemployment, the EIB guarantee fund for SMEs and ESM credit lines for Member States. At their meeting on 23 April, the European Heads of State and Government agreed to work towards establishing a Recovery Fund which &ldquo;shall be of a sufficient magnitude, targeted towards the sectors and geographical parts of Europe most affected, and be dedicated to dealing with this unprecedented crisis&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  In her speech to the European Parliament on 13 May, Commission President von der Leyen set out the Commission thinking on the Recovery Fund which suggests that recovery planning will need to include massive public and private investment at European and national level. The entirety of the Recovery Fund will be channelled through EU programmes, both new and existing programmes which work well. President von der Leyen has also been consulting with EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, on the proposed Recovery Fund. It is not clear at this stage exactly how the Recovery Fund will be allocated to the different Member States, including Ireland, or which precise sectors will be covered. However, in her speech to the Parliament, the Commission President indicated that the Fund would be channelled through 3 pillars: a new Recovery and Resilience tool, plus top-ups to Cohesion, allocated based on the severity of the economic and social impacts of the crisis; a strengthened InvestEU and a new Strategic Investment Facility; and strengthened key programmes to address the COVID-19 crisis as well as a new health programme. <\/p>  <p>  France and Germany also made a joint proposal for the design of the Fund based on the Commission borrowing &euro;500 billion raised using the EU budget.

Ireland contributes humanitarian assistance to alleviate the worst of this suffering, including through our support for UNRWA, which is a key provider of public services, health and education in Gaza. I have initiated an Irish-funded solar power project in Gaza, which will help improve water quality in the area. More recently, my Department allocated additional funding to support the medical response to COVID 19 in the Gaza Strip. <\/p>  <p>  However, the roots of the problem in Gaza are political and cannot be solved by funding alone. What is needed is the lifting of the blockade, so that normal life and normal economic activity can resume. Gaza faces other challenges, including oppressive rule by Hamas, but the blockade dominates peoples&rsquo; lives in Gaza to such an extent that it is difficult to address other issues.

This is a statutory requirement contained in sections 3 and 16 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).  Section 2 of the Act defines the \"liability date\" of a given year as the 1 November of the preceding year. <\/p>  <p>  Liability for Local Property Tax (LPT) arises where a person owns a residential property on a liability date, which for 2014 and subsequent years is 1 November. Thus, liability for the year 2020 was established on 1 November 2019 and the person who was the liable person in relation to a property on this date is required to pay the LPT liability for the full year 2020, regardless of whether the ownership of the property changes during that year and before the following liability date of 1 November 2020 (for the year 2021). However, while liability is to be established on 1 November in a year, the LPT does not have to be paid until the following year. <\/p>  <p>  There are good reasons why liability is established before the start of the relevant year and why the tax charge is not apportioned over a year between two different owners where a property is sold during a year. Having a single liability date provides certainty about who is responsible for payment and avoids disputes about the number of days for which different property owners might be liable.  The period between the liability date at the beginning of November and the end of a year, allows the taxpayer time to put different types of phased payment arrangements in place for the following year such as direct debit or deduction at source from a person&rsquo;s salary or occupational pension.  <\/p>  <p>  In many cases where a property is being sold, the seller is also purchasing a replacement property around the same time. While such a person may end up having to pay LPT in respect of the property being sold, the LPT for the property being purchased is likely, depending on the date of sale, to end up being paid by the previous owner. The net result for each party to the sale is the payment of LPT on a single property.  Furthermore, now that LPT has become an established tax it has become common practice, as part of sale\/purchase negotiations, for sellers and purchasers of residential properties to take the ongoing LPT liability of the seller into account and to adjust the sales price accordingly so that, in effect, the purchaser ends up paying the LPT liability for the part of the year for which he or she owns the property. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[7352\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if changes will be made to the wage subsidy scheme in order to grant the payment to mothers on maternity leave and due to return to work in view of the fact those who were not on payroll in March 2020 are not entitled to the payment;

In that regard, it is noted that, as of 25 May, almost 56,300 employers and over 482,800 employees have thus far benefited from the measure.  <\/p>  <p>  It ultimately gives a sum to employers to cover a portion of their wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions that have had to be introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  The sum the employer receives is based on the employees who were on their payroll on 29 February 2020, the net salary such employees received in January and February 2020, as well as the extent to which the employer remains able to continue to discharge their legal obligation to pay their employees&rsquo; salaries.<\/p>  <p>  The TWSS is built upon historic PAYE returns made to Revenue.  One of the core principles of the scheme that is necessary to prevent abuse is the requirement that the employees for which a claim is submitted must be on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after 29 February 2020, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, whether maternity related or otherwise, that salary cannot be included in the calculation of the sum that is available to the employer under the TWSS.<\/p>  <p>  The 29 February payroll decision has consequences for many groups, however, the scheme is being administered in a manner that is fully compliant with all relevant legislation and no discriminatory treatment of workers arises.  <\/p>  <p>  Further, the position in relation to the TWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay.  The question of an individual&rsquo;s employment entitlements following their resumption of work after a period of leave, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters between the employee and the employer &ndash; and the entire period of pregnancy and maternity leave is a special protected period under the law.  <\/p>  <p>  It is understood that although the employer may not be able to claim the TWSS for a person who has not been on the payroll on 29 February but is entitled to return to work after this date, they remain obliged to honour their obligations as an employer as the full suite of employment rights legislation continues to apply in relation to all employees and their employers for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the operation of the TWSS, I am aware of the matter that has been raised by the Deputies and I have instructed officials to re-examine whether such workers may be accommodated at this time within the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC06400"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[7450\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC06500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) in relation to property insurance during Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>I appreciate that many people with premises due to re-open in the current environment have genuine concerns regarding whether they will have insurance cover for claims relating to COVID-19, including those involved in tourism such as guesthouses or other forms of accommodation. Whether a person&rsquo;s property insurance provides cover for such claims will depend on the specifics of his\/her insurance policy, and it is possible that some policies may cover such claims, but it is also likely that others will not. In addition, on renewal it is possible that many insurers will change their terms and conditions to exclude any claims for COVID-19. It should be noted however that neither I, nor the Central Bank, have any influence over the decisions of insurers in relation to the provision of such cover.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to the Deputy&rsquo;s point that individuals may claim against property owners if they allege that they have contracted COVID-19 on their property, the only comment I would make is that it may be difficult to prove where a person caught the virus in the first place, therefore taking such actions may not be straightforward, and even if initiated, there can be no guarantee of a successful outcome. For now, I believe that the best way that a business can protect itself from litigation is to follow public health guidelines and implement social distancing measures.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been some suggestions that the State should provide an indemnity to re-opening businesses for COVID-19 claims in circumstances where they have not been able to get any insurance cover. However, I believe that it would be financially unsustainable for the State to provide such a blanket indemnity for all litigation relating to COVID-19 outbreaks, there would also be a significant moral hazard in doing so and could also be wider unintended consequences in the insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on insurance issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank of Ireland, Insurance Ireland and the sector on an ongoing basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700113#WRC06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700114#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[7609\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700114#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if childminders will continue to be able to access the childminders tax credit if they provide care in the home of the child on a temporary basis as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.","asker":"1484","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>Childcare services relief is an income tax exemption that is available to individuals who provide childminding services in their own homes.

On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on the 27th of March and indicated amongst other things the following:<\/p><p>(i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  <\/p><p>(ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed, as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.<\/p><p>Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on the 3rd of April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close. <\/p><p>Following on from my correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on the 17th of April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly. I also discussed a range of other insurance related matters on the teleconference, including motor insurance premium refunds, and a statement outlining the nature of my engagement with Insurance Ireland was issued by the Department and can be found here: <\/p><p>In addition, the Deputy should note that the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. The key messages that the Bank conveyed are as follows:<\/p><p>- Insurers must put forward consumer-focussed solutions on policy payment breaks, rebates and claims. <\/p><p>- While most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. <\/p><p>- The Central Bank expects the CEOs of Irish authorised firms to take responsibility for the oversight of how their firm is managing determinations of whether claims are covered or not in the context of COVID-19. <\/p><p>The CBI is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I have set out already to the House that I strongly believe that insurers should treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally and honour those elements of the policies covered including business interruption claims in line with the CBI&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  However, I cannot compel insurers to pay business interruption claims and neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank, have any role in adjudicating on such matters.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. bringing the matter to the attention of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or seeking to go down the litigation route.  In this regard, I note that a number of legal actions have been initiated by some publicans.  Notwithstanding these constraints, my officials are maintaining regular contact with Insurance Ireland on this and other issues and are keeping me updated on developments.  Furthermore, I have also recently indicated in the Dail, that I intend engaging again directly with Insurance Ireland in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700114#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700114#WRD04000"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[7328\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700114#WRD04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied) relating to the temporary wage subsidy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was legislated for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and that the TWSS is an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.

The underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed having regard to the Government objective of providing assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the Covid 19 pandemic and the restrictions which were introduced as a result. The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector.

The sector to which the Deputy refers is no different in this regard. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s priority in so far as the TWSS is concerned was and is to ensure that all employers experiencing significant negative economic disruption from COVID-19 can register for and start to receive payment quickly. The objective of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once the crisis has passed.  <\/p><p>A key eligibility criterion for the scheme requires that where a business is experiencing a significant negative economic disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the employer must make a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, as a result of disruption to the business caused (or to be caused) by the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic; and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully, but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.  <\/p><p>An employer that has been hit by a significant decline in business but has strong cash reserves, which are not required to fund debt, may still qualify for the scheme, but the Government would expect such an employer to continue to pay some element of employees&rsquo; wages.

This was provided for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. The core principles of the scheme are that:<\/p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,<\/p><p>- the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, <\/p><p>- the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and  <\/p><p>- the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020. <\/p><p>The TWSS is predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020.Regarding the subsidy amount, no distinction is made based on whether the business has closed due to Government restrictions or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work part-time or full-time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>As regards the personal tax liability of dentists or other self-employed individuals, a self-assessed income taxpayer is required to pay preliminary tax by 31 October in a year, or later if paying online via the Revenue Online Service (ROS).  The amount of the payment is<\/p><p>- 90% of the current year&rsquo;s liability;<\/p><p>- 100% of the prior year&rsquo;s liability; or<\/p><p>- 105% of the tax due for the tax year preceding the immediately previous tax year (often called the &lsquo;pre-preceding year&rsquo;).  <\/p><p>The &ldquo;pre-preceding year&rdquo; option only applies to taxpayers paying by direct debit.

The scheme builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, that the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020 and that the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020.  The latter two requirements in particular were critical safeguards against abuse of the scheme.    <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that following a review of cases since the TWSS commenced, it became apparent that a number of employers had been unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and are otherwise tax compliant.  Given the purpose and objectives of the scheme, Revenue announced on 24 April 2020, under its care and management provisions, that it would allow such employers access the scheme provided: <\/p>  <p>  - the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, <\/p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and  <\/p>  <p>  - the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Where a business qualifies for the scheme under the revised criteria and makes the necessary declaration that it is significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, the wage subsidies under the scheme will be payable for eligible employees in respect of payroll submissions made on or after 24 April 2020, with a pay date on or after 24 April 2020. These revised arrangements cannot be made retrospective.  Where a business fails to meet the revised qualifying criteria for TWSS but wishes to further engage with Revenue on the matter, it must provide supporting evidence setting out the rationale for why it should be included in the scheme. This supporting documentation should be provided via Revenue&rsquo;s myEnquiries system.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have indicated, the PAYE reporting obligations built into the eligibility criteria for the TWSS were designed in particular to prevent abuse of the scheme.

In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  <\/p>  <p>  The key prescribed conditions of the scheme are that &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative  economic impact due to the pandemic and is unable to pay normal wages to employees, but wishes to continue to employ the employees and is making best efforts to continue to pay some wages to the employees, <\/p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and<\/p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but recently extended to before the 1 April 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The amount of the temporary wage subsidy payable in relation to eligible employees is based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020 for each employee.  <\/p>  <p>  I clarified in my letter of 16 April 2020 to Revenue, which set out my determinations of the amounts of wage subsidy to be payable in relation to different classes of employees, that for the purposes of the operation of the TWSS, the Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay is the employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay for January and February 2020 based on the payroll submissions made by the employer concerned to Revenue.  It is a matter for each employer concerned to decide what amount of normal wages should be paid to employees in addition to the wage subsidy amounts, and whether to try match the employees&rsquo; previous gross or net pay.  Ultimately, what employees are most concerned about is how near the aggregate of the wage subsidy amount plus whatever amount of normal wages is being paid net to them by employers is to their normal take home pay.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it has now implemented the revised rates of wage subsidy as determined by me on 16 April 2020, with the remainder to be implemented shortly. The revised rates apply as respects payroll notifications received by Revenue on or after 4 May 2020 in respect of payroll runs to be made on or after that date. The revised rate now implemented include:<\/p>  <p>  - the 85% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay does not exceed &euro;412,<\/p>  <p>  - non-tapering of the 85% subsidy where an employer contribution of more than 15% of the employees net weekly pay results in a salary payment of up to &euro;350 per week,<\/p>  <p>  - the flat rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;412 but less than &euro;500,<\/p>  <p>  - the 70% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;500 but less than &euro;586, with a maximum subsidy of &euro;410 applying,<\/p>  <p>  - a maximum payment of &euro;350 per week for employees whose average net weekly pay is greater than &euro;586 per week but not more than &euro;960 per week, subject to specific tapering reductions based on the employer contribution to the net weekly earnings. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the TWSS is operated in real-time by employers through the normal payroll process. To ensure that subsidy amounts are paid to employees on a timely basis as part of the relevant payroll run, it is necessary to calculate the amount of the subsidy due to an employee based on the employee&rsquo;s gross pay. This is necessary as an employee&rsquo;s net pay cannot be fully determined before the actual payroll is run. Revenue is aware that, in effect, this means that for some employees where the employer pays between (net weekly) &euro;586 and &euro;960, the full amount of the subsidy due to an employee may not be paid through the payroll run concerned.  However, Revenue has confirmed it will be implementing a system development to ensure that any subsidy amounts that remain due to such employees will be calculated, by Revenue, following the submission of the actual payroll or payrolls. Arrangements will then be made by Revenue to pay any outstanding subsidy amount directly to the employees concerned. The necessary system development to achieve this will be implemented shortly and will be applied retrospectively from 4 May 2020 to any impacted weekly, fortnightly or monthly paid employees. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE00600"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[7426\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an impact assessment has been carried out on the status of credit unions here in view of the Covid-19 pandemic; the supports that can be offered to credit unions; his views on the future of credit unions here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1563","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>First of all, I wish to inform the Deputy that both I and my officials have engaged extensively with the credit union representative bodies since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  I spoke with the credit union representative bodies, by conference call on 23 March 2020 and again on 22 April 2020 to discuss the challenges and emerging issues facing the credit union sector as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. I welcomed the ongoing work of the credit union sector to support members in difficulties due to COVID-19 and acknowledged the health and safety risk front line staff are facing every day to ensure continuity of services to members. I noted the vital work the credit union sector is carrying out, which builds on the government&rsquo;s call for solidarity and community spirit which is synonymous with credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my officials have had weekly calls with the credit union representative bodies and weekly engagement sessions with the Registry of Credit Unions in the Central Bank to review any emerging issues in the sector resulting from the pandemic, and to ensure smooth information flow between the sector and Government. The Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) is also meeting weekly.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the key role that credit unions play in the delivery of financial services in local communities across Ireland, the need for which is heightened at this time. Credit unions account for approximately one third of the consumer credit market and are well positioned to provide access to credit to support the recovery from the current crisis.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the overall financial position of the sector, credit unions have come into this crisis with a strong reserves position, with a sector average reserve ratio of 16% as at 31 December 2019. This highlights that many individual credit union boards have chosen to prudently maintain additional reserves over the 10% regulatory minimum requirement. Credit unions have also maintained high levels of liquidity, with a sector average liquidity ratio of 39% as at 31 December 2019. Notwithstanding the strong financial position of the sector at December 2019, sustainability is a challenge for many credit unions.<\/p>  <p>  Generally speaking, the current business model of Irish credit unions is suffering from low growth rates in loan demand over recent years (outpaced by stronger savings growth). Surplus funds not lent out to members are appropriately not exposed to undue risk, and they yield limited investment returns reflective of the current low interest rate environment. The operational business model lacks scale efficiencies and suffers from high operating costs. This has translated into low loan to asset ratios (sector average 28%), low return on assets (sector average 0.6%) and high cost income ratios (sector average 82%).<\/p>  <p>  The economic outlook arising by virtue of COVID-19, including reduced demand for new lending, has increased the challenges the sector is already facing. As a result it was agreed that the CUAC would report to me by 30 June on challenges and opportunities for the sector, incorporating implications of COVID-19, the role credit unions could play in the economic recovery and any relevant recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Building Finance Ireland","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE00900"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[7446\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for loans to Home Building Finance Ireland since its establishment; the number of loan approvals; the number of loan drawdowns; the cash value of the applications, approvals and drawdowns; and the number of units of accommodation involved in the applications, approvals and drawdowns to date.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The details sought by the Deputy are set out in the following table for the period 28 January 2019 to 19 May 2020.  <\/p><p>In relation to the cash value and the number of units of accommodation identified at the applications stage, for a variety of reasons these numbers can vary significantly from the applications finally considered by HBFI and therefore I am advised by HBFI they are not in a position to provide these numbers as they could be considered as a comparator to the approved numbers when in many cases they will not accurately represent the final application considered. <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th><div>Data for the period 28\/01\/2019 to 19\/05\/2020<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number   of Applications for loans<\/td>       <td>70<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number   of Loan Approvals<\/td>       <td>23<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number   of Loan Drawdowns<\/td>       <td>7 drawn loans (36 individual drawdown requests within these 7 loans)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cash Value of Approvals<\/td>       <td>&euro;134m*<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cash Value of Drawdowns<\/td>       <td>&euro;12m*<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of units involved in the Approvals<\/td>       <td>743<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of units involved in the Drawdowns<\/td>       <td>247 units either under construction or already completed (based on the 7 drawn loans)<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>* Rounded to the nearest million<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Tax","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[7535\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when VRT applications will commence.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[7678\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700115#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider allowing a company (details supplied) to reopen immediately.","asker":"1513","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 69 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in respect of registrations and examinations carried out in the National Car Testing Service Centres, a resumption proposal has been submitted by the Road Safety Authority to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that would see a limited number of Centres resume on 8 June 2020 for NCT testing.

Last month, the members of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) announced their intention to extend these payment breaks to six months for households and businesses which require it.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and in line with regulatory requirements.

These options may result in an increase in monthly repayments due to the overall increase in the cost of credit  and this should be fully explained to the borrower.

The European Commission is expected to publish their proposals on 27<sup>th<\/sup>May. <\/p><p>On the 13<sup>th<\/sup>May, the President of the European Commission, President von der Leyen, made an address to the European Parliament in which she outlined that the Commission&rsquo;s proposed recovery package would consist of two parts; firstly, the EU Budget\/the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and secondly, on top of the MFF, a recovery instrument to be funded through a larger headroom within the EU Budget. We await the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  <\/p><p>In the meantime, a number of Member States have published their views on what should be included in the Recovery Plan, how and where the expenditure should be targeted, whether support should be provided through loans and\/or grants, whether conditions should be applied to Member States availing of the funding and how the recovery fund should be financed.<\/p><p>On 18<sup>th<\/sup>May, Chancellor Merkel and President Macron presented joint French and German proposals for European Recovery.

One of the main aims of the policy underpinning the design of HTB was to help encourage the building of additional new properties.

This said, I am aware that there have been many concerns expressed about how the insurance industry is responding to the needs of its business policyholders in these difficult times, particularly in terms of forbearance and other flexible measures  being offered to them. My officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much needed certainty for business policyholders.<\/p><p>I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March requesting that it press its members to provide some reliefs to their customers to alleviate the pressures brought on as a result of the current situation, and for insurers to have a common approach on how they are supporting their business customers in this difficult time.  The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on 10 April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - will apply the following common measures which will be available to their business customers:<\/p><p><b>Forbearance<\/b><\/p><p>- Insurers will reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability\/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor.<\/p><p>- Insurers will allow up to 28 days after renewal for payment.<\/p><p><b>Business Premises<\/b><\/p><p>- Insurers will maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings\/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days). Appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required.<\/p><p>- Insurers will support requests for a change of property use during the crisis.<\/p><p>I believe that it is imperative that insurers implement these measures wholeheartedly and without causing difficulties to their customers.  The focus of my engagement to date has been with Insurance Ireland, noting that a number of its members have UK-based parent companies including one particular company who cover play centres. Despite my Department actively engaging with Insurance Ireland on that matter, the company has not signed up to this agreement.  My Department continues to engage with Insurance Ireland on this matter.<\/p><p>In relation to those insurers who are not members of Insurance Ireland including UK insurers, my understanding is that they are aware of this forbearance arrangement, however have made the decision not to apply it  for their own particular reasons. It should be noted that I have no influence over these companies in relation to their day to day commercial decisions, however I have asked my officials to consider how best they could engage with such companies to see if they could reconsider their position and participate in the forbearance arrangement or a similar arrangement that would assist their Irish customers.<\/p><p>In terms of the role of the Central Bank on this matter, the Deputy should note that the Central Bank has written to insurance firms with Irish consumers, irrespective of where the firms are prudentially regulated. The Bank requires firms to have processes in place to engage positively with customers who are experiencing difficulties in the payment of premiums because of COVID-19. The Bank also expects insurance firms to take account of the difficult and challenging situation in which many customers find themselves. The Bank has also stated that, as a matter of urgency, firms should develop consumer-centric solutions to the handling of insurance payment breaks and policy rebates in light of the COVID-19 emergency.<\/p><p>As stated at the outset, the Central Bank has no mandate to instruct insurers to issue rebates. Additionally, the Central Bank does not have a mandate for investigating individual policyholder complaints or making determinations on the interpretation of policy wordings; these powers belong to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (where appropriate) and ultimately the courts. Nonetheless, as part of a wider programme of supervision which commenced in March, the Central Bank is continuing to engage with the larger insurance firms to ascertain their approach to dealing with specific elements of COVID-19.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on these issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank, Insurance Ireland and others, as appropriate, on an ongoing basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700116#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700116#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[8008\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700116#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of businesses that have availed of each of the Covid-19 supports put in place by his Department; the number of employees that have availed of each scheme; the cost to date of each scheme in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1459","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, Revenue has worked with my Department to introduce a series of measures and supports to help businesses deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I have absolute confidence that Revenue will respond appropriately to tax issues faced by taxpayers as a consequence of the COVID 19 situation and will keep taxpayers fully informed of decisions in this area.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT), I am advised by Revenue that the date on which CAT is payable is determined by the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; on which the market value of the property included in a gift or an inheritance must be established. Where this date is between 1 January and 31 August, CAT is payable by 31 October in the same year. Where this date is between 1 September and 31 December, CAT is payable by 31 October in the following year.<\/p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 contains the rules for determining the valuation date. The valuation date depends on the circumstances particular to a case and is not a fixed date in relation to all gifts and inheritances. In the case of a gift, the valuation date is generally the date on which the property is given to a beneficiary. In the case of an inheritance, however, it can be earlier as it is the date on which the executors of the will become entitled to retain the property for the benefit of a beneficiary. Generally, this is the date on which probate or administration is granted.<\/p>  <p>  Where the benefit consists of property, it may well be the case that CAT is payable before a beneficiary has received the property due to a delay in completing the administration of an estate. Equally, where a beneficiary has actually received the property, CAT may be payable before a beneficiary has had the opportunity to sell that property and pay the tax liability.<\/p>  <p>  Outside of the current COVID-19 circumstances, the length of the conveyancing process is such that it is often the case that a CAT liability arises before a property can be sold to pay that liability. To provide for such situation, taxpayers have a statutory entitlement to payment by instalments in certain circumstances.  Monthly instalment payments for up to five years may be allowed subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8%. However, Revenue has discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship. In such circumstances, Revenue also has discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the gift or inheritance involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700116#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycle to Work Scheme","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700116#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[8015\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700116#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider changes to the cycle to work scheme to facilitate employees purchasing new bicycles and electric bicycles (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>Section 118(5G) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the cycle to work scheme.

The law affords taxpayers options on how to calculate their preliminary tax payments, including in most cases allowing the taxpayer to base the payment, either on their estimated liability for the current year, or period, or on their final tax liability for a previous year, or period.  This gives the taxpayer the flexibility to choose the option that, having regard to their own circumstances, including fluctuations in taxable income between years, gives rise to the lowest preliminary tax payment.<\/p><p>A self-assessed income taxpayer can base their preliminary tax payment on the lower of either <\/p><p>- 90% of the current year&rsquo;s liability; or<\/p><p>- 100% of the prior year&rsquo;s liability.<\/p><p>Individuals who pay their tax by direct debit have the additional option of basing their preliminary tax payment on 105% of their liability for the pre-preceding year.<\/p><p>A company that is a &ldquo;small company&rdquo; &ndash; broadly, a company whose corporation tax liability in the preceding accounting period did not exceed &euro;200,000 &ndash;  also has the option of basing their preliminary tax payment on either 90% of its liability for the current accounting period or 100% of its liability in the preceding accounting period. <\/p><p>A company that is not a &lsquo;small company&rsquo; - because its corporation tax liability in the preceding accounting period exceeded &euro;200,000 - is required to pay preliminary tax in two instalments.

The welfare of students and that of their families is front and centre in all decision making. My Department has worked closely with the Department of Health and the HSE on the In This Together campaign which aims to help everyone in Ireland to Stay Connected, Stay Active, and look after their Mental Wellbeing throughout the Covid-19 Emergency. The In This Together campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the InThis Together site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by NEPS. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department has worked with the Department of Health and HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. A planning group has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, and the NGO sector, in recognition of the fact that prior to, during and following national emergencies there is a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs. <\/p>  <p>  The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  These services augment the work of NEPS and assist students who may be feeling anxious at this time. In addition, additional support services have been identified for the general population that can assist students and their families at this time. <\/p>  <p>  During this challenging time the school building may be closed but schools have structures in place to support students. It has often been the case, that the first port of call for Leaving Certificate students who are experiencing distress has been their school. Schools have developed excellent and flexible systems of support. Many schools have a designated Student Support Team, while other schools have equivalent systems and structures, but may use different terminology to describe their arrangements, such as &lsquo;Care Team&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pastoral Care Team&rsquo;. Either way, the structures schools have in place will continue to have a key role identifying issues and students for discussion by the Student Support Team with appropriate action\/ follow-up. In these uncertain times, the familiarity of these school structures and personnel will offer continuity and reassurance to students. A guidance document for Post-Primary Schools on supporting the wellbeing of students and the role of Student Support Teams was  written by NEPS and has been published by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers, students, parents. NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for students with identified difficulties, and in signposting to more specialist support, when needed, including onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.  <\/p>  <p>  NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to school communities at this time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700117#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700117#WRG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[7077\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700117#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the school transport scheme for pupils will be reassessed in view of the difficulties facing parents in getting their children accepted into their nearest school (details supplied).","asker":"1519","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.<\/p><p>In the current school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, are transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. <\/p><p>In general children are eligible for school transport if they meet the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school. <\/p><p>Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.

The document sets out information on the process of estimating marks for students to receive calculated grades, and this has been sent to all schools. The document, together with Frequently Asked Questions, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Further guidance and resources are being developed to support the implementation of Calculated Grades. These include an instructional video for teachers and information leaflets for schools and for parents\/guardians.<\/p>  <p>  Teachers are asked to use their professional judgement, drawing on existing records and available evidence to arrive at an estimated mark for each student. <\/p>  <p>  If a student is new to a class or school, then the teacher should consult the previous teacher to obtain any relevant documentation.

In the normal course of events, the majority of children with disabilities access multidisciplinary therapy services through the HSE. Many of these services have been scaled down during the Covid-19 emergency situation as staff are redeployed. The reduction in these services, combined with school closures are putting substantial demands on children with disabilities and their families. It is intended that the temporary assignment of SNAs to support children&rsquo;s disability services during this public health emergency will help to alleviate the stress being experienced by these vulnerable families. <\/p><p>My Department's &lsquo;<i>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs&rsquo;<\/i>document provides a framework for SEN Teachers and SNAs to maintain contact with SEN students and to provide appropriate learning support.  It is acknowledged and welcomed that many SNAs have been engaged in such work through their schools since the closure period began.  It has been confirmed to school management that, in the interim period pending the assignment of an individual SNA to the HSE, that SNA is available to support their allocated students through their school. <\/p><p>The HSE has now finalised the details of a new service which SNAs will provide during the school closure period.  The HSE has started assigning SNAs to families and children identified in their services.<\/p><p>There has been close cooperation between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE in establishing and managing the scheme to date. The Departments and the HSE hold weekly meetings with the Education Division of F&oacute;rsa (the trade union representing SNAs) to resolve any issues of concern. <\/p><p>SNAs will be asked to provide support to those students in receipt of HSE Disability services by way of remote working through the use of telephones, smart phones or laptops. They will work under the guidance and direction of the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;key point of contact&rsquo; who will be a clinician such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. The key point of contact will provide strategies for working with the child \/ family and will signpost the SNA towards any resources required.  Communication channels between the school and the SNA will be facilitated where appropriate to ensure that SNAs can receive guidance where educational issues arise during the course of the suite of supports being provided by the HSE teams during this period. <\/p><p>SNAs will be matched with students, and wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s). If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.<\/p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  <\/p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.<\/p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service.

In PISA 2018, 5,577 Irish students completed the assessment in Ireland.

The report concludes:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;In this moment of crisis, digital technology holds great promise to provide learners with access to high quality learning. However, most education systems need to pay close attention to ensure that technology does not amplify existing inequalities in access and quality of learning further. This is not only a matter of providing access to technology and open learning resources, but will also require maintaining effective social relationships between families, teachers and students, particularly for those students who lack the resilience, learning strategies or engagement to learn on their own. Technology can amplify the work of great teachers, but it will not replace them.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Digital Strategy for Schools outlines my Department's vision to realise the potential of digital technologies to enhance teaching, learning and assessment so that Ireland's young people become engaged thinkers, active learners, knowledge constructors and global citizens to participate fully in society and the economy. A central theme of the Strategy is Teacher Professional Development, and a Digital Learning Framework, supported by an extensive programme of CPD, is now available. This Framework will enable teachers and schools to progress in their usage of digital technologies depending on their own circumstances and to identify their particular support requirements. My Department recognises that the embedding of digital technologies can enhance teaching and learning, through appropriate supports grounded in informed pedagogical best practice.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of school closure,s required under Covid-19 measures, schools and teachers were advised of the requirement to effectively engage with parents and learners to ensure continuity of teaching and learning for all their students. To enable this, extensive support material on distance learning has been made available through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including the delivery of Webinars on relevant topics. My Department has published guidance for schools and teachers, to support remote learning and the continuity of teaching and learning for all students including students with special education needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage. Guidance has also been published for parents and is available on my Departments website in 12 languages. Schools are advised to ensure that in their approach to providing for the continuity of learning due consideration is given to put in place alternative arrangements where solutions involving digital technology may not be appropriate or available, to the learner. Key to this guidance is the requirement for ongoing engagement between schools, teachers, parents and learners. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;50m ICT grant funding has now issued to schools, and this can be used by schools to prioritise requirements arising out of the Covid-19 school closures, to support remote learning. This can include arrangements to loan school computing devices to teachers and learners who experience difficulties in accessing appropriate devices as well as putting in place appropriate learning platforms to deliver remote learning. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with stakeholders including management bodies, teacher representatives, parent and students representatives during the current period of school closures to provide supports to enable the continuation of teaching and learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700119#WRJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[7228\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700119#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the monitoring undertaken by his Department of the number of children that do not have access to broadband or to high enough quality broadband to engage in digital learning initiatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1503","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>Since the announcement that schools would close and the extension of that closure, my Department has provided guidance to schools and teachers in the education sector to ensure that they continue to work and to engage with their students to continue the delivery of education.

My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school. <\/p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.<\/p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.  <\/p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved<\/p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  <\/p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.<\/p><p>The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.<\/p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes.<\/p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.<\/p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020\/21.  <\/p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.<\/p><p>On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.<\/p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.<\/p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.<\/p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open addtional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an addtional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.<\/p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.<\/p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.<\/p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.<\/p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.  <\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, on individual children is not provided by the NCSE to my Department<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700122#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700122#WRO01600"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[7630\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700122#WRO01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated full year cost of recruiting 50 additional school principal posts in primary and post-primary schools.","asker":"1621","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":591,"content":"<p>The salary of a Principal teacher is determined by the teacher&rsquo;s years of service, qualifications in the case of a teacher first recruited prior to 2011, the size of the school and the sector where appointed. <\/p><p>The teacher&rsquo;s basic salary scale at both Primary and Post Primary levels range from &euro;35,088 to &euro;64,302 for teachers appointed prior to 2011 and from &euro;36,953 to &euro;69,407 for teachers appointed post 2011. <\/p><p>The minimum qualification for a Primary teacher is a primary degree.

In the normal course of events, the majority of children with disabilities access multidisciplinary therapy services through the HSE. Many of these services have been scaled down during the Covid-19 emergency situation as staff are redeployed. The reduction in these services, combined with school closures are putting substantial demands on children with disabilities and their families. It is intended that the temporary assignment of SNAs to support children&rsquo;s disability services during this public health emergency will help to alleviate the stress being experienced by these vulnerable families. <\/p><p>My Department's &lsquo;<i>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs&rsquo;<\/i>document provides a framework for SEN Teachers and SNAs to maintain contact with SEN students and to provide appropriate learning support.  It is acknowledged and welcomed that many SNAs have been engaged in such work through their schools since the closure period began.  It has been confirmed to school management that, in the interim period pending the assignment of an individual SNA to the HSE, that SNA is available to support their allocated students through their school. <\/p><p>The HSE has now finalised the details of a new service which SNAs will provide during the school closure period.The HSE has started assigning SNAs to families and children identified in their services.<\/p><p>There has been close cooperation between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE in establishing and managing the scheme to date. The Departments and the HSE hold weekly meetings with the Education Division of F&oacute;rsa (the trade union representing SNAs) to resolve any issues of concern. <\/p><p>SNAs will be asked to provide support to those students in receipt of HSE Disability services by way of remote working through the use of telephones, smart phones or laptops. They will work under the guidance and direction of the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;key point of contact&rsquo; who will be a clinician such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. The key point of contact will provide strategies for working with the child \/ family and will signpost the SNA towards any resources required.  Communication channels between the school and the SNA will be facilitated where appropriate to ensure that SNAs can receive guidance where educational issues arise during the course of the suite of supports being provided by the HSE teams during this period. <\/p><p>SNAs will be matched with students, and wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s). If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.<\/p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  <\/p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.<\/p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service. Where possible they will ask SNAs to attend one of their offices to do this but where SNAs are self-isolating, have underlying health conditions or have childcare or other caring responsibilities, the induction can be done remotely.<\/p><p>The HSE are providing a dedicated IT platform which will allow the HSE to match SNAs to children \/ families.

A working group on mitigating educational disadvantage is supporting on-going responses to what is an evolving situation, to ensure the continuation of crucial funding sources such as SUSI grants, the 1916 Bursary Scheme, the Student Assistant Fund, Fund for Students with a disability and other allowances. All stakeholders in this group have worked to support learners without access to sufficient technology and to ensure the continuation of services offered by access and disability offices, guidance counsellors and counselling services. <\/p><p>My Department is conscious of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education. <\/p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020\/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. Students are advised to submit their renewal student grant application as soon as possible.

The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. <\/p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).<\/p><p>The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018 a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020.<\/p><p>Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.<\/p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The <i>In This Together<\/i>campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the <i>InThis Together<\/i>site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by NEPS. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department has worked with the Department of Health and HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. A planning group has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, and the NGO sector, in recognition of the fact that prior to, during and following national emergencies there is a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs. <\/p><p>The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help, and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  These services augment the work of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department and assist students who may be feeling anxious at this time. In addition, additional support services have been identified for the general population that can assist students and their families at this time. <\/p><p>During this challenging time the school building may be closed but schools have structures in place to support students. It has often been the case, that the first port of call for Leaving Certificate students who are experiencing distress has been their school. Schools have developed excellent and flexible systems of support. Many schools have a designated Student Support Team, while other schools have equivalent systems and structures, but may use different terminology to describe their arrangements, such as &lsquo;Care Team&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pastoral Care Team&rsquo;. Either way, the structures schools have in place will continue to have a key role identifying issues and students for discussion by the Student Support Team with appropriate action\/ follow-up. In these uncertain times, the familiarity of these school structures and personnel will offer continuity and reassurance to students. A guidance document for Post-Primary Schools on supporting the wellbeing of students and the role of Student Support Teams has been developed by NEPS and published by my Department. <\/p><p>NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers and school communities. NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for students with identified difficulties, and in signposting to more specialist support, when needed, including onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.  NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to schools at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700125#WRR03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":751,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700125#WRR03700"},{"type":"question","counter":752,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[7965\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700125#WRR03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the specific measures introduced to ensure continuity of learning for primary school children during the Covid-19 pandemic in view of the fact that teaching has moved from the classroom to online; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":753,"content":"<p>My Department is taking a number of actions to ensure continuity of teaching and learning for primary school children due to the Covid 19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  A range of guidance has been published to assist schools and teachers to ensure continuity of learning to support students while out of school.

In the normal course of events, the majority of children with disabilities access multidisciplinary therapy services through the HSE. Many of these services have been scaled down during the Covid-19 emergency situation as staff are redeployed. The reduction in these services, combined with school closures are putting substantial demands on children with disabilities and their families. It is intended that the temporary assignment of SNAs to support children&rsquo;s disability services during this public health emergency will help to alleviate the stress being experienced by these vulnerable families. <\/p><p>My Department's &lsquo;<i>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs&rsquo;<\/i>document provides a framework for SEN Teachers and SNAs to maintain contact with SEN students and to provide appropriate learning support.  It is acknowledged and welcomed that many SNAs have been engaged in such work through their schools since the closure period began.  It has been confirmed to school management that, in the interim period pending the assignment of an individual SNA to the HSE, that SNA is available to support their allocated students through their school. <\/p><p>The HSE has now finalised the details of a new service which SNAs will provide during the school closure period.The HSE has started assigning SNAs to families and children identified in their services.<\/p><p>There has been close cooperation between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE in establishing and managing the scheme to date. The Departments and the HSE hold weekly meetings with the Education Division of F&oacute;rsa (the trade union representing SNAs) to resolve any issues of concern. <\/p><p>SNAs will be asked to provide support to those students in receipt of HSE Disability services by way of remote working through the use of telephones, smart phones or laptops. They will work under the guidance and direction of the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;key point of contact&rsquo; who will be a clinician such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. The key point of contact will provide strategies for working with the child \/ family and will signpost the SNA towards any resources required.  Communication channels between the school and the SNA will be facilitated where appropriate to ensure that SNAs can receive guidance where educational issues arise during the course of the suite of supports being provided by the HSE teams during this period. <\/p><p>SNAs will be matched with students, and wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s). If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.<\/p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  <\/p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.<\/p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service. Where possible they will ask SNAs to attend one of their offices to do this but where SNAs are self-isolating, have underlying health conditions or have childcare or other caring responsibilities, the induction can be done remotely.<\/p><p>The HSE are providing a dedicated IT platform which will allow the HSE to match SNAs to children \/ families.

Many of these services have been scaled down during the Covid-19 emergency situation as staff are redeployed. The reduction in these services, combined with school closures are putting substantial demands on children with disabilities and their families. It is intended that the temporary assignment of SNAs to support children&rsquo;s disability services during this public health emergency will help to alleviate the stress being experienced by these vulnerable families. <\/p><p>My Department's &lsquo;<i>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs&rsquo;<\/i>document provides a framework for SEN Teachers and SNAs to maintain contact with SEN students and to provide appropriate learning support.

They will work under the guidance and direction of the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;key point of contact&rsquo; who will be a clinician such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. The key point of contact will provide strategies for working with the child \/ family and will signpost the SNA towards any resources required.  Communication channels between the school and the SNA will be facilitated where appropriate to ensure that SNAs can receive guidance where educational issues arise during the course of the suite of supports being provided by the HSE teams during this period. <\/p><p>SNAs will be matched with students, and wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s). If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.<\/p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  <\/p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.<\/p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service.

Part 3 is the core of the personal insolvency legislation, dealing with the operation in practice of the three personal insolvency mechanisms &ndash; Debt Relief Notices, Debt Settlement Arrangements, and Personal Insolvency Arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  In practice, the insolvency legislation has already been extensively reviewed and developed since 2012. Key reforms introduced include the section 115A court review process (which removed the so-called &lsquo;bank veto&rsquo;) enacted in 2015, interlocking reforms to bankruptcy also enacted in 2015, and the establishment in 2016, and extension in 2019, of the Abhaile Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (which in effect ensures that borrowers at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears can access free independent expert financial and legal advice to get solutions into place, and can access legal aid to support a section 115A court review application or appeal).  <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we have always said that we will keep this important legislation under review, and will take any further action needed to ensure that it operates effectively.   <\/p>  <p>  In the course of the public consultation, a range of detailed submissions was received. These have been carefully analysed, and a number of follow-up discussions have been held with the stakeholders concerned.   <\/p>  <p>  The submission from the Insolvency Service of Ireland highlighted a number of points where it believes legislative amendments would be beneficial. Given the ISI&rsquo;s statutory role in monitoring the operation of the personal insolvency system and advising me on matters related to their functions, their suggestions are particularly important for the review. Subsequent discussions with the ISI have highlighted additional possible changes to the Personal Insolvency Acts. <\/p>  <p>  The ISI&rsquo;s Consultative Forum, which brings together a variety of stakeholders involved in personal insolvency, made a separate submission to the review, which indicated a strong level of consensus between representatives of debtors and creditors in support of specified measures to streamline the personal insolvency process. <\/p>  <p>  Submissions received also suggested measures to extend access to personal insolvency options to a wider cohort of borrowers, and to encourage more constructive engagement with the legislation by both creditors and debtors, with a view to supporting and accelerating the agreement of sustainable statutory personal insolvency options. <\/p>  <p>  All of these proposals are being considered as part of the review.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the closing date for submissions, some additional issues emerged, and the timeframe for the review was extended to allow these to be taken into account. Most of these have since been resolved by a series of important court judgments under the Personal Insolvency Acts. A small number of remaining points are likely to be the subject of recommendations by the review. <\/p>  <p>  The finalisation of the review, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Finance, has been delayed by other urgent legislative priorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains an active priority for completion. As the Deputy is aware from my replies to his recent questions (D&aacute;il Question No. 486 of 20 May 2020 and Covid-19 PQ 5.709 of 5 May 2020), those priorities include consideration of certain specific formal or procedural statutory requirements which may be difficult or impracticable to comply with, due to COVID-19 restrictions, including a small number of requirements under the Personal Insolvency Acts, so that any necessary amendments could be addressed in an urgent forthcoming Bill. <\/p>  <p>  I expect the review report to be finalised by September, following further consultations with the Department of Finance, as required by s. 141 of the Acts, and with the  Office of the Attorney General. That timetable, as the Deputy will appreciate, is of course subject to the legislative priorities that will be decided in the new Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700129#WRV03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Probation and Welfare Service","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700129#WRV03600"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[7407\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700129#WRV03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the changes have been made to the community return scheme; the reason persons that had their applications made to the Probation Service before the change had their cases investigated under the old scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":933,"content":"<p>The Community Return Scheme is an incentivised early release scheme co-managed by the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service. The Community Return Scheme was introduced in 2011 as a means of ensuring that where appropriate, prisoners released on Temporary Release engaged in structured activities within their communities, under the supervision of the Probation Service. Prisoners released on the Community Return Scheme contribute to their local communities by engaging in activities such as working in charity shops, maintenance of public areas, sports facilities etc. I am informed by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that all prisoners considered for early release under the Scheme are subject to a rigorous assessment process with the primary consideration being that of public safety.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme has been a positive development since its inception. As well as allowing prisoners to complete their sentence by way of performing a service to the community, it has significantly helped these prisoners to successfully resettle in their communities. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was evaluated in 2014 with that evaluation pointing to very high levels of compliance among prisoners at a rate of 89%.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was further reviewed in 2019 and, acting upon the advice of my officials in both the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service, I broadened the eligibility criteria for the Scheme with a view to identifying further numbers of prisoners who could be released safely into the community in response to capacity issues across the prisons estate arising from rising prisoner numbers. The change in criteria was also linked to increasing the cohort of prisoners who could avail of the rehabilitative effects of participation in the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Those changes to the eligibility criteria were introduced in August 2019. I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that it has recently emerged that a misinterpretation of the eligibility criteria resulted in a very small number of prisoners (three) having their cases assessed for eligibility under the old criteria.

That has always been our priority. <\/p>  <p>  I do appreciate that the circumstances in which the Skellig Accommodation Centre was opened did not allow for full engagement with local representatives, communities and services; to inform and reassure them and to answer their questions. That is certainly something that I, Minister Flanagan and our officials regret. But, during a public health emergency the decision to move people to a dedicated accommodation centre was seen as an appropriate positive response.  <\/p>  <p>  All centres are following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at its website www.hpsc.ie.  That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic. My Department is working closely with the HSE in doing so. <\/p>  <p>  At the very outset of the crisis, my Department discussed with the HSE the fact that we were accommodating some people in commercial hotels that the Department did not have exclusive use of. This was seen as higher risk at that time in the early stages of the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  For that reason, we needed to move people to dedicated accommodation centres where they could receive the full set of State supports and services. To do this, we needed to open more accommodation. The Skellig Star hotel in Cahersiveen had been offered to us and was available for immediate occupancy. <\/p>  <p>  We also opened new centres in Rosslare Harbour and Tullamore and temporary accommodation in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. <\/p>  <p>  In total, 600 people were relocated to support social and physical distancing including just over 100 people to the new centre in Cahersiveen. <\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of the residents arrived in Cahersiveen on March 18 and 19.   Some of them did come from a hotel in Dublin at which a case of COVID-19 was subsequently confirmed in an unrelated guest.  My Department was not told of that confirmed case until it was brought to Minister Flanagan&rsquo;s attention by Deputy Catherine Murphy on 6 April 2020. <\/p>  <p>  From subsequent discussions with management at the hotel, our understanding is that the guest involved had only stayed at the hotel for one night in early March when they fell ill. The guest was removed to hospital and their close contacts were asked by the HSE to self-isolate for 14 days as is the norm. No one that we were accommodating in the hotel was approached as a traced contact, and there was no indication whatsoever that anyone we relocated from that hotel was in any way unwell, was awaiting a test or a test result.  In fact, it was well over a fortnight after they arrived before any of our residents in Cahersiveen were confirmed as positive for COVID 19. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, medical information such as testing, test results and the release of data relating to same are matters for the HSE in a public health context. We can confirm that, in line with our agreed policy with the HSE, anyone who has tested positive has been moved to a dedicated self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. Everyone else in the centre was asked to self-isolate while the HSE continued to monitor the situation. Thankfully, the HSE has confirmed that that period of self-isolation ended on 20 May 2020 and all residents are now subject to the same restrictions as anyone else under Phase 1 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.   <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 69 residents (including 9 children) onsite in the centre, which has capacity for 150 residents, and 56 bedrooms. Residents are a mix of single people and small sized families. All single residents have been offered their own bedroom and all bedrooms in the centre are en suite. Some residents have declined this offer and have indicated that they wish to self-isolate with their roommate as a family unit. We continue to encourage these residents to accept the offer of their own room at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Guidance has been provided by the HSE to centre management on the enhanced cleaning arrangements required at this time including through an onsite visit by a HSE infection control specialist. This applies to bedrooms, corridors, staircases, the dining room, kitchen, laundry room, lift, public toilets and reception and public areas. This is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the HSE and centre management to provide additional supports for residents during this time. There has been a HSE Community Development Worker onsite at the Centre seven days a week to monitor the health of residents.  This person is supported by a wider healthcare team.  Now that the outbreak has been declared over, he will remain at the centre until the end of May to support residents. Additional outdoor space has been opened up with some seating provided and, exercise equipment has been set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. This outdoor equipment has been installed with the knowledge and support of HSE public health, and will be operated under their direction for safe use. <\/p>  <p>  The residents are currently provided with three meals and snacks daily. However, in line with the overall policy objectives for accommodation centres, the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period. In the meantime, the chefs in the centre are working with the residents to find out about preferred meals and staff have been asked to source and provide ethnic snacks for residents. Kettles have been provided in rooms so that residents can make refreshments throughout the day rather than using communal facilities and meals are also being delivered to rooms. The centre has a good Wi-Fi service and phone credit has also been provided for residents so that they can keep in touch with family and friends. <\/p>  <p>  The current restrictions are especially difficult for children. In addition to the upgrades to the outdoor space, toys, puzzles and tablets have been being provided for children and laptops have also been provided for residents&rsquo; use. The Tusla official seconded to work with my Department has contacted the families to see what additional supports they need and to discuss any concerns they might have. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have held virtual clinics with residents and a telephone support service for residents across all centres, run by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS), was launched on 20 May. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to work with accommodation centre management, health agencies and NGOs to provide every support possible to residents at this unprecedented and difficult time for all. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700129#WRV05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"question","counter":951,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[7553\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700129#WRV05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a rigorous testing and tracing system will be implemented in a direct provision centre (details supplied) to address the spread of Covid-19 in the setting.","asker":"1567","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":952,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, medical information such as testing, test results and the release of data relating to same, are matters for the HSE in a public health context. <\/p>  <p>  However, I can confirm that testing of residents and staff has already been completed in Cahersiveen by HSE Public Health.

My Department is working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  At the very outset of the crisis, my Department discussed with the HSE the fact that we were accommodating some people in commercial hotels that the Department did not have exclusive use of. This was seen as higher risk at that time in the early stages of the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  For that reason, we needed to move people to dedicated accommodation centres where they could receive the full set of State supports and services. To do this, we needed to open more accommodation. The Skellig Star hotel in Cahersiveen had been offered to us and was available for immediate occupancy. <\/p>  <p>  We also opened new centres in Rosslare Harbour and Tullamore and temporary accommodation in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. <\/p>  <p>  In total, 600 people were relocated to support social and physical distancing including just over 100 people to the new centre in Cahersiveen. <\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of the residents arrived in Cahersiveen on March 18 and 19.   Some of them did come from a hotel in Dublin at which a case of COVID-19 was subsequently confirmed in an unrelated guest.  My Department was not told of that confirmed case until it was brought to Minister Flanagan&rsquo;s attention by Deputy Catherine Murphy on 6 April 2020. <\/p>  <p>  From subsequent discussions with management at the hotel, our understanding is that the guest involved had only stayed at the hotel for one night in early March when they fell ill. The guest was removed to hospital and their close contacts were asked by the HSE to self-isolate for 14 days as is the norm. No one that we were accommodating in the hotel was approached as a traced contact, and there was no indication whatsoever that anyone we relocated from that hotel was in any way unwell, was awaiting a test or a test result.  In fact, it was well over a fortnight after they arrived before any of our residents in Cahersiveen were confirmed as positive for COVID 19. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, medical information such as testing, test results and the release of data relating to same are matters for the HSE in a public health context. We can confirm that, in line with our agreed policy with the HSE, anyone who has tested positive has been moved to a dedicated self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. Everyone else in the centre was asked to self-isolate while the HSE continued to monitor the situation. Thankfully, the HSE has confirmed that that period of self-isolation ended on 20 May 2020 and all residents are now subject to the same restrictions as anyone else under Phase 1 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.   <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 69 residents (including 9 children) onsite in the centre, which has capacity for 150 residents, and 56 bedrooms. Residents are a mix of single people and small sized families. All single residents have been offered their own bedroom and all bedrooms in the centre are en suite. Some residents have declined this offer and have indicated that they wish to self-isolate with their roommate as a family unit. We continue to encourage these residents to accept the offer of their own room at this time. <\/p>  <p>  Guidance has been provided by the HSE to centre management on the enhanced cleaning arrangements required at this time including through an onsite visit by a HSE infection control specialist. This applies to bedrooms, corridors, staircases, the dining room, kitchen, laundry room, lift, public toilets and reception and public areas. This is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the HSE and centre management to provide additional supports for residents during this time. There has been a HSE Community Development Worker onsite at the Centre seven days a week to monitor the health of residents.  This person is supported by a wider healthcare team.  Now that the outbreak has been declared over, he will remain at the centre until the end of May to support residents. Additional outdoor space has been opened up with some seating provided and, exercise equipment has been set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. This outdoor equipment has been installed with the knowledge and support of HSE public health, and will be operated under their direction for safe use. <\/p>  <p>  The residents are currently provided with three meals and snacks daily. However, in line with the overall policy objectives for accommodation centres, the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period. In the meantime, the chefs in the centre are working with the residents to find out about preferred meals and staff have been asked to source and provide ethnic snacks for residents. Kettles have been provided in rooms so that residents can make refreshments throughout the day rather than using communal facilities and meals are also being delivered to rooms. The centre has a good Wi-Fi service and phone credit has also been provided for residents so that they can keep in touch with family and friends. <\/p>  <p>  The current restrictions are especially difficult for children. In addition to the upgrades to the outdoor space, toys, puzzles and tablets have been being provided for children and laptops have also been provided for residents&rsquo; use. The Tusla official seconded to work with my Department has contacted the families to see what additional supports they need and to discuss any concerns they might have. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have held virtual clinics with residents and a telephone support service for residents across all centres, run by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS), was launched on 20 May. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to work with accommodation centre management, health agencies and NGOs to provide every support possible to residents at this unprecedented and difficult time for all. The support shown by the local community to the residents is greatly appreciated and I hope that once our centres are open to visitors again they will come and visit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700130#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Inquiries","counter":960,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700130#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":961,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[7619\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700130#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the statutory inquiry in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":962,"content":"<p>The Inquiry referred to by the Deputy is ongoing. <\/p><p>In November 2019, I granted an extension of time until June 2020 for the Inquiry.

It reflects the commitment in the Programme for Government to create an equal, fair and inclusive society for all, to target discrimination and to enable LGBTI+ people to overcome the barriers they face. <\/p>  <p>  The development of this Strategy was underpinned by a robust consultation process from October 2018 until February 2019 including a series of regional and thematically focused workshops. Specific workshop sessions were organised for international protection applicants, migrants and refugees.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Strategy recognises the vulnerability of LGBTI+ people within the International Protection process and commits to measures to ensure they are treated sensitively and provided with appropriate supports over the course of the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  These measures include the introduction of new National Standards for our accommodation centres.  The National Standards, published last August last year, were developed with UNHCR Ireland and members of the NGO community. The Standards are being implemented in new centres that are being contracted at present. <\/p>  <p>  One of the Standards, which will benefit members of the LGBTI+ community in our accommodation centres, will be the need for continuous training to improve the service for all living in the centre, and confidential information provision through leaflets and posters in order to promote dignity. <\/p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy of some current measures in place in our centres.<\/p>  <p>  A Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment is implemented in our accommodation centres, which includes safeguarding residents from harassment or violence based on their sexual orientation. <\/p>  <p>  The International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department  (IPAS ) have staff present at the International Protection Office when a person first applies for International Protection. Should an applicant require accommodation or other services, IPAS determines the most suitable accommodation based on the needs of each individual or family group.  Where a person discloses their self-determined identity to IPAS, they are, in so far as is possible and practicable, assigned accommodation based on their needs. This determination may include the provision of shared accommodation with a partner who is also seeking accommodation or being accommodated within the Direct Provision system.  This would, of course, only apply where this information is disclosed.  <\/p>  <p>  At any time during their stay in an accommodation centre, a resident has the option to request a transfer to a more suitable centre.  The policy of the IPAS is to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of all residents. Staff working in accommodation centres receive regular training to equip them with the skills to support all residents.  <\/p>  <p>  The IPAS liaises with State and NGO support agencies to assist our residents who may need guidance or support.  In this regard, LGBT Ireland work with residents in our centres who identify as LGBTI. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2018, LGBT Ireland has facilitated a monthly peer support group for LGBTI+ people in the International Protection process.  Is Rainbow Muid continues to be active and provide vital supports to LGBTI+ people living in our accommodation centres at this time.<\/p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that IPAS together with the Inclusion, Equality and Gender Equality Unit of my Department are in the process of developing a broad LGBTI+ policy, which will include a transgender accommodation policy to promote equality, take account of people's self-determined identity and ensure that the safety and wellbeing of all residents is also promoted. It had been hoped that the LGBTI+ policy for IPAS would be finalised by the end of the first quarter of this year. Unfortunately, this was not possible due to the Covid-19 crisis. However, important contacts have been made between IPAS and support agencies in the LGBTI community and a meeting between LGBT Ireland and IPAS took place at the beginning of March 2020. Further meetings with TENI and BelongTo will be arranged  as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700130#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":966,"content":"<p>Question No. 348 answered with Question No. 341.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":967,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700130#WRW01500"},{"type":"question","counter":968,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[7629\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700130#WRW01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; by rank attached to the Wexford Garda division drugs unit as of 31 December 2018 and 15 May 2020, in tabular form.","asker":"1621","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":969,"content":"<p>The Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.

In order to be of assistance, I have had enquiries made and a list of Commissioners for Oaths in the Meath area has been provided.  <\/p><p>As I have previously outlined in relation to the information provided on Peace Commissioners, while every effort is made to maintain accuracy, I must caution that this list of Commissioners for Oaths is not always up to date in taking account of changes in the personal circumstances of individual Commissioners for Oaths since their appointment. The Supreme Court Office is reliant on the Commissioners of Oaths to inform them of such changes in circumstances. Moreover, I understand that the list provided is very likely to contain the names of Commissioners for Oaths who have passed away.  In providing the Deputy with this information, therefore, I would be anxious that the information be handled sensitively and that it would not be a source of upset to family members of a Commissioner of Oaths (or indeed a Peace Commissioner) within the lists who have since passed away.  Due to the nature of the Commissioner of Oaths records , some of which are paper based and contained in ledger books while more recently moving to the electronic recording of this information, the Courts Service have advised that there is a small margin of error when creating a list to cover a full county area spanning many decades as this one does.  <\/p><p><b>Commissioners for Oaths in Meath<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Names<\/th>       <th>Names<\/th>       <th>Names<\/th>       <th>Names<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mary Farnan<\/td>       <td>Michael Cooney<\/td>       <td>Annette Kelly<\/td>       <td>Vincent O&rsquo;Reilly<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Rachel Ginnity <\/td>       <td>Frank Dunne<\/td>       <td>Louis Noonan<\/td>       <td>Thomas Kelly<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Norbert Smith<\/td>       <td>Michael Weldon<\/td>       <td>Thomas Noonan<\/td>       <td>Dermot Morris<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Seamus Murphy<\/td>       <td>James Carolan<\/td>       <td>Edward Rogers<\/td>       <td>Thomas Daniel<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>PJ McKenna<\/td>       <td>Mary Connell<\/td>       <td>William F.

MEI have confirmed that most colleges are now offering on-line courses, and students should contact their college directly to make any necessary arrangements.<\/p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that I understand and recognise the difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on all immigrants, and in particular our international student population. <\/p><p>I announced yesterday, 26 May, that students who are still in the State and who have completed their maximum 2 years language study, but due to COVID-19 are unable to return home at this time, may remain as students until the end of the year provided they re-enrol in an online course of study for the remainder of the year. They will have to register the permission as usual once the Registration Offices reopen.<\/p><p>I also announced that language students who left the State before completion of their studies<b><\/b>due to COVID-19, may resume their studies and the duration of their absence will not count towards the maximum period of study allowed.<\/p><p>I hope these new measures will provide some welcome assurance and certainty for the coming months and we will continue to keep the situation under active review as matters evolve in our national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These new measures are in addition to the previously announced, temporary arrangements put in place for students awaiting first time registrations, students who wish to change their permission and students who wish to avail of the Third Level Graduate Programme.<\/p><p>In previous announcements I also amended the rules around working hours and provided that where a school or college is physically closed due to COVID-19 students can work 40 hours per week instead of the previous 20 hours. However, as I announced on 13 May, it is a requirement that anyone seeking to remain in the State as a student has to re-enrol in an online course of study. <\/p><p>It should be noted that visa required students will be required to apply for a visa before returning to the State if the validity period of the visa has expired.  While the Immigration Service has temporarily ceased accepting new visa applications, persons legally resident in the State are included in the categories of Priority\/Emergency cases, which will continue to be processed.  Visa required students are advised to consult the Immigration Service website for the required documentation - <i>www.inis.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>Additionally, my Department is considering alternative arrangements for renewal of registrations and priority will be given initially to those whose Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card has expired. Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage all students to regularly consult our updates on the Immigration Service website at:<\/p><p><i><\/i>.<\/p><p>A detailed Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document is available on this website on the impact of COVID-19 on immigration and international protection.

I understand that, as of 26 May 2020, there has been no positive prisoner case of Covid-19 within the Irish prison service. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Irish Prison Service continues to manage the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines.  In doing so, it maintains a close working relationship with my Department, relevant criminal justice authorities, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the classification of prisoners as a vulnerable group by the NPHET means that the Irish Prison Service must exercise an abundance of caution in relation to the unwinding of the measures which are currently in place to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading in our prisons. <\/p>  <p>  I am assured by the Irish Prison Service that its Emergency Response Planning Team is continually updating contingency plans in relation to Covid-19.  I am further informed that these contingency plans are, by their nature, highly operational and are subject to change given the multiple scenarios that are possible.  I am assured that the Irish Prison Service will publicise changes and plans in a timely manner, as the situation develops. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query on risk assessments, I am informed that, in the context of declining rates of infection in the community, the Irish Prison Service is currently carrying out a risk assessment to determine when and how the restrictions put in place in recent months may be eased, while also ensuring that it maintains control of the risk of the spread of infection and ensures good order and security in the prisons.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the risk assessment currently being undertaken includes the following elements:<\/p>  <p>  - Reviewing the physical access in-reach services provided to the prisons, including psychology, education, chaplaincy and addiction counsellors. In terms of current arrangements it may be noted that to mitigate against the impact of these services not being available in a traditional manner, I understand the Prison Service has put in place a dedicated phone service for prisoners to reach out to chaplains, psychologists and addiction counsellors and that it has increased the use of technology to ensure these essential services continue.  <\/p>  <p>  - Reviewing at what stage and how physical visits with families may resume, while maintaining controls at point-of-entry to screen for the infection; maintaining social distancing in the waiting rooms and during visits.  Pending any change and as the Deputy may be aware, additional phone calls have been provided to prisoners and a facility for family video-link calls has also been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  - Reviewing the regime management plans in place, which restrict the movement of prisoners around the prison and impacts out-of-cell and yard time. Again it should be noted that to mitigate against the negative impact of the more restricted regimes in place during the current Covid-19 pandemic, I am informed that the Prison Service has ensured that gym facilities for prisoners remain opened, albeit on a reduced schedule and has taken a range of other measures including for example installation of additional TV channels for prisoners in their cells and issuance of a weekly newsletter to prisoners providing information on what the Irish Prison Service is doing and why. <\/p>  <p>  - I am also informed that the Prison Service is working with the HSE to put in place a process that will facilitate the testing of all new committals to the prisons at an early stage, which will allow for the prisoner to exit quarantine and enter the general population at an earlier stage, provided test results are negative. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the Irish Prison Service has assured me that it is at all times cognisant of the impact of its decisions on people in custody. This impact is taken into account at all times, including at every stage of the planning process and the implementing of actions necessary to control and mitigate against the risk of Covid-19 in the prison environment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700131#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"question","counter":1027,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[8132\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700131#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reduction in the prison population needed to ensure there are adequate facilities available to deal with a possible outbreak of Covid-19 in the prison system; the criteria being used to determine Covid-19 related early releases to reduce overcrowding in the prison system; if this is purely risk based; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1028,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, Covid-19 provides unique challenges to custodial institutions, including our prisons.

Subsequently, prisoners assessed as low risk who had less than 6 months to serve were also granted temporary release from some prisons.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that all prisoners granted temporary release were assessed on a case-by-case basis, utilising the existing criteria for temporary release. The primary factor in the consideration of any prisoner for early release remains public safety. Risks assessed included any convictions for domestic abuse, such as breach of barring orders which present significant risks at the present time. I am informed that other criteria taken into account include the nature and gravity of the offence, length of sentence served to date, prior record on temporary release, behaviour while in custody and previous criminal history.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the size of the prison population changes on a daily basis, as new committals and remands are made by the courts and releases occur as prisoners reach the end of their sentences. However, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the prison population has reduced from a total of 4,214 on 12 March 2020 to a total of 3,755 on 26 May 2020.  This represents a reduction of 459 or approximately 11% over the period. The range of measures introduced has therefore meant that the occupancy in many prisons has been reduced in order to support infection control and isolation measures as much as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, prisoners are considered a particularly vulnerable group and an outbreak of Covid-19 would present significant challenges for prison management in terms of controlling the spread among other inmates and prison staff.  However the strategy employed by the Irish Prison Service to control the risks arising during this pandemic has to date been successful, thanks to the detailed planning carried out and the cooperation and understanding of all concerned, including both staff and prisoners.

I am informed that to date feedback from prisoners and families that have used the system successfully has been very positive. I am also informed that, as with any new system and process, and especially one that is implemented within a very short time frame, there have been a number of challenges and technical issues with some calls but that the Prison Service continues to work on any issues to solve them.  I understand that there have been particular difficulties in recent days, following a video phone software update which resulted in system crashes on a number of occasions in the past week. Resolution of this IT difficulty required temporary suspension of visits for a short time, but I understand that the system has now been restored.  It is also the case that some issues may arise due to factors outside the control of the Irish Prison Service, which may include for example poor broadband coverage impacting connectivity for some visitors.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that useful &ldquo;how to&rdquo; guides are published on the Irish Prison Service website at for the information of people using the remote visit facilities.  In addition, I understand that the Irish Prison Service has set up a dedicated helpline for the families of prisoners who may experience difficulty in connecting to a scheduled video call.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that where a scheduled video-call does not take place due to a technical problem, every effort is made to ensure that the prisoner is provided with the opportunity to have a normal phone call with their family member instead. <\/p><p>I am further informed that all new initiatives introduced have been risk assessed, to ensure there are measures in place to prevent the virus from spreading through prisoners sharing handsets or other equipment, and to ensure the maintenance of good order and security. <\/p><p>In the absence of direct contact from people in the outside community, I understand that the Irish Prison Service is at the same time taking steps to maintain good communication with prisoners and staff; and to allow prisoners to maintain human contact during these difficult times. I am informed that the Irish Prison Service has set up a dedicated team to co-ordinate the communication of information about the pandemic and its impact to prisoners. <\/p><p>I understand that two prisoner newsletters are published weekly, on a collaborative basis between the IPS, the Education and Training Board and the Irish Red Cross. Tailored regular communications with regular Covid-19 information leaflets for prisoners (developed by the prison Red Cross Prisoner Volunteers) and Covid-19 information newsletters for staff are being distributed to raise awareness of the particular risks the virus poses in a prison environment and to provide accessible updates on the necessary actions being taken. There is also a special newsletter for prisoners who are in quarantine or cocooning with tailored messaging for them. Prisoners who are in quarantine or cocooning can use the prisoner phone system to access prisoner services from Psychology, Chaplaincy, resettlement or Merchants Quay. <\/p><p>I understand that this system is being reviewed to ensure that it meets requirements and to assess if the service can be improved further.  Further and in general, I understand that the Irish Prison Service continues to manage the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines.

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).  <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provided for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the DSS in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018).    <\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Act which relates to Enduring Powers of Attorney has not yet been commenced. At present, enduring powers of attorney are created under the Powers of Attorney Act 1996. When Part 7 of the Act is fully commenced, new enduring powers of attorney will be created under the 2015 Act and registered by the Director of the DSS.  The implementation of the Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the registration of enduring powers of attorney when the Act is fully commenced.   A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.   <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group has given detailed consideration to the feasibility of commencing the remaining uncommenced provisions of the Act (including Part 7) however, due to the complexity of the Act and the interconnectivity of its provisions, it is not possible to make any further commencement orders until the DSS is operational. The DSS, led by its Director, is working tirelessly to put in place the necessary infra-structure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS.  These key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed to enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. The Department is committed to seek further funding through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021 but this will of course be subject to available exchequer funding through that process. In the interim, and subject to the funding allocation, the Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan which anticipates commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including for example the Courts Service and the HSE, Departments of Health and Justice and Equality, amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group comprised of all of these stakeholders is meeting regularly to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700132#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":1078,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700132#WRY01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700132#WRY01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[7068\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700132#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to include social work on the general employment permit.","asker":"1476","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1079,"content":"<p>Ireland operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.

I am conscious that, for practical reasons, the impact on some businesses has been particularly severe. On Wednesday, 20 May I had a meeting via conference call with representatives of the hair and beauty and barber industry to discuss the implications of Covid-19 for their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  With specific regard to queries around cashflow and working capital, the SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme opened for eligibility applications on 23 March and currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. <\/p>  <p>  Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.<\/p>  <p>  Funding under this scheme is offered at favourable terms and at a lower interest rate than other similar SME lending available in the market. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Applicants may also be able to avail of a three-month interest-only payment period (depending on your lender&rsquo;s assessment of your application).<\/p>  <p>  There are significant advantages to operating these loan guarantee schemes through participating financial providers. This allows the Government to leverage existing commercial lending infrastructure to provide an efficient mechanism for making competitive lending products available to Covid-19-impacted businesses. The guarantee structure ensures that eligible applicants to the schemes represents a reduced risk to the participating lender, which in turn ensures access to appropriate financing for more businesses. <\/p>  <p>  However, the operation of these loan schemes through the financial providers also means that interest is a feature of the loans, as some interest must be charged by the lenders to cover overheads and capital costs if they are to continue to work with Government.<\/p>  <p>  For micro-enterprises (businesses with fewer than 10 employees), the Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), has been introduced as a support to help businesses affected by the Covid-19 crisis to access funding. <\/p>  <p>  These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six-month interest-free and repayment-free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. These loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the network of Local Enterprise Offices around the country, or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committee.  An interest rate of 5.5% is applied to loans sought directly through MFI.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of new supports, on 2 May, I announced a &euro;2billion Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years. Loans under the scheme will be offered at below market interest rates, and the scheme will support a variety of credit facilities.<\/p>  <p>  A number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted were also outlined on 2 May. These included:<\/p>  <p>  - A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;<\/p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt;<\/p>  <p>  - A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue to provide full services to the public.<\/p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a new &euro;250m Restart Fund, which will be a critically important tool in supporting small businesses as they begin to reopen. This fund will provide up to &euro;10,000 to micro and small businesses and will be implemented either through a rebate or waiver scheme based on rates payment for 2019, and will be targeted more widely at micro and small enterprises that have suffered large falls in revenue as a result of the crisis.

Compliance with the COVID-19 Return to Work Safely Protocol will become part of the normal inspection regime.

The details are being finalised at present. The HSA will carry a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSA's Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline. If, following contact from a worker, and follow-up engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit. Importantly, if, on foot of an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action - up to and including the closure of a workplace - will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.<\/p>  <p>  However, even with the support of resources from other Government Departments, the inspectorate cannot be expected to go into every business in the country.

I am conscious that, for practical reasons, the impact on some businesses has been particularly severe. On Wednesday, 20 May I had a meeting via conference call with representatives of the hair and beauty and barber industry to discuss the implications of Covid-19 for their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  With specific regard to queries around cashflow and working capital, the SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme opened for eligibility applications on 23 March and currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. <\/p>  <p>  Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.<\/p>  <p>  I would stress that the application process for these SBCI schemes is not onerous. Businesses need only confirm their eligibility for the scheme by application through the SBCI website. After a successful application, they will be issued an eligibility reference number, which they can use to make an application for a loan from one of the participating finance providers. <\/p>  <p>  As of 21 May, of the 2,591 applicants for eligibility under the scheme, only 13 had so far been found to be ineligible. The SBCI has also put in place a helpdesk that responds to any queries arising around the application process.<\/p>  <p>  Funding under this scheme is offered at favourable terms and at a lower interest rate than other similar SME lending available in the market. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Applicants may also be able to avail of a three-month interest-only payment period (depending on your lender&rsquo;s assessment of your application).<\/p>  <p>  For micro-enterprises (businesses with fewer than 10 employees), the Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), has been introduced as a support to help businesses affected by the Covid-19 crisis to access funding. <\/p>  <p>  These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six-month interest-free and repayment-free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. These loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the network of Local Enterprise Offices around the country, or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committee.  An interest rate of 5.5% is applied to loans sought directly through MFI.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of new supports, on 2 May, I announced a &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years. Loans under the scheme will be offered at below market interest rates. <\/p>  <p>  Across the EU, different member states have prioritised different features of their respective liquidity supports to businesses, and so a direct comparison may not be appropriate. However, from the data available, Ireland&rsquo;s loan guarantee schemes appear to be in line with many countries: they cover 80% of the loan value, at commercial or slightly lower rates.<\/p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a new &euro;250m Restart Fund, which will be a critically important tool in supporting small businesses as they begin to reopen. This fund will provide up to &euro;10,000 to micro and small businesses and will be implemented either through a rebate or waiver scheme based on rates payment for 2019, and will be targeted more widely at micro and small enterprises that have suffered large falls in revenue as a result of the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700133#WRZ06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700133#WRZ06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1162,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[7327\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700133#WRZ06600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will address a matter regarding the hairdressing and beauty industry (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1163,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out five stages for unlocking the restrictions put in place to contain the Coronavirus, at three week intervals.

The NOTC is working to address the issue of outbreaks in meat processing plants and has input from professionals in public health, environmental health, animal health and the Health and Safety Authority, in relation to occupational health and safety.  The National Outbreak Control Team and local Outbreak Control Teams are in place to address outbreaks of COVID-19 and to recommend steps and measures to ensure that current and future outbreaks can be managed and brought under control as quickly as possible.

I understand that a number of claims by owners of diesel vehicles affected by cheat devices, or defeat devices as they are also known, are currently before the courts in Ireland. In some cases, actions are being taken on behalf of a number of car owners. <\/p>  <p>  While car manufacturers have contested these claims, there have been important recent developments in response to claims for compensation in other European countries. In Germany, Volkswagen reached a settlement in late February 2020 with the Federal Association of Consumers following an action taken by the Association on behalf of 400,000 car owners. In the course of the proceedings, the State court hearing the case advised the parties to seek a settlement. Under the settlement, Volkswagen agreed to pay compensation totalling &euro;830 million to the car owners concerned. The compensation to be paid to individual owners ranges from &euro;1,350 to &euro;6,250 depending on the age of the vehicle.  On 25 May 2020, Germany&rsquo;s highest civil court, the Federal Court of Justice, ruled in a landmark judgment that the owner of a Volkswagen diesel minivan purchased in 2014 was entitled to return the vehicle to the manufacturer and receive a refund of approximately 80 per cent of the payment price. The judgment held that the vehicle&rsquo;s mileage should be taken into account in calculating the compensation payable to the owner. In a statement issued in response to the judgment, the company indicated that it would seek to bring compensation claims by a further 60,000 car owners in Germany to a prompt conclusion and would be making appropriate settlement proposals to these claimants. It is relevant to note that neither the German government nor the consumer protection authorities in Germany have had any direct involvement in either the compensation settlement with the Federal Association of Consumers or the compensation claims taken by individual car owners. <\/p>  <p>  In a significant preliminary judgment in a group action taken by 90,000 car owners, the High Court of England and Wales ruled on 6 April 2020 that the software installed in diesel cars manufactured by the Volkswagen Group was a defeat device under the relevant EU regulations. In an Opinion of 30 April 2020 in a case referred to the European Court of Justice, the Advocate General noted that the use of defeat devices that reduce the effectiveness of emission controls systems is prohibited under EU law and may be authorised only in exceptional circumstances where, for example, their use is justified to protect the engine against damage or accident and for the safe operation of the vehicle. This exception must however be interpreted strictly and is limited to protecting the engine against the occurrence of immediate and sudden damage and not against more long-term effects such as wear and tear or depreciation. Though the Opinion of the Advocate General is not binding on the European Court of Justice, it is followed by the Court in the majority of cases. <\/p>  <p>  I fully support the claims of car owners whose vehicles have been affected by cheat devices installed by car manufacturers to appropriate compensation for the detriment caused by these devices. In view in particular of the settlement reached with the Federal Association of Consumers in Germany and of the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice in Germany, it is now time for Volkswagen and other car manufacturers whose vehicles had cheat devices installed in them to come forward with fair proposals to compensate affected car owners in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700134#WRAA07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1245,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[7858\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700134#WRAA07400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the measures that will be taken to ensure that consumer rights are protected and that no excessive charging for products such as handwash and sanitiser take place during the Covid-19 crisis period; and the recourse consumers have for the excessive charging for such products (details supplied).","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1246,"content":"<p>The power for Government under section 62 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to fix by order the maximum price at which a product can be supplied to consumers applies only where an emergency order is in force in relation to that product under section 61 of the Act.

The Protocol should be used by all workplaces to adapt their workplaces procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE and the Department of Health. It is operating in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I would emphasise that, in the first instance, employers and workers have a responsibility to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying, and adhering to, the procedures and practices set out in the Protocol designed to protect the health and safety of all concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has full powers to oversee compliance with the health, safety and wellbeing of workers in their place of work.  While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through human contact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs at this time. <\/p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol. It is ensuring compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate and as set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. <\/p>  <p>  The HSA is carrying out a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSA Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline, tel: 1890 289 389 and email wcu@hsa.ie. If, following contact from a worker, and engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit. However, if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is satisfied that in terms of overseeing adherence to the Protocol, there are sufficient legislative powers under the Health and Safety at work legislation, as well as existing and enhanced public health powers and the suite of employment rights legislation, to ensure, and enforce, if necessary, full compliance with the Protocol.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1256,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[7918\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will provide a bespoke support scheme for private bus and coach operators affected by the Covid-19 lockdown; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1257,"content":"<p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. <\/p><p>These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead<i>.<\/i>For a full list of supports for business please see .<\/p><p>The full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. <\/p><p>In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.<\/p><p>The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme was announced on 11 March and opened for eligibility applications on 23 March.

The report includes analyses by the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform which makes clear that the most-heavily impacted sectors are Accommodation and Food, Construction, Administrative and Support Services, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade, and other Personal Services. Other sectors where the impacts are significant but somewhat less severe include the Manufacturing sector, and Transport and Storage. This pattern of sectoral impacts is similar to that observed in other countries. In terms of employment, the report observes that the Department of Finance&rsquo;s &lsquo;central&rsquo; scenario in its Stability Programme Update projects employment to fall substantially in 2020, with approximately 220,000 jobs being lost. The unemployment rate is projected to dramatically rise over the first half of the year, with an average rate in the mid 20% range during the second quarter, before falling over the second half of the year, as containment measures are gradually eased.<\/p><p>The CSO has conducted surveys on the business impacts of COVID-19 with the most recent release of 18th May last presenting findings of the second wave of the exercise. The Business Impact of COVID-19 Survey (BICS) has been created to measure and report quickly on the impact of COVID-19 on business in Ireland. A total of 3,000 enterprises were surveyed online for BICS Wave Two, with 24.5% of sampled enterprises completing the survey. The survey reports:<\/p><p>- Nearly one in four (23.9%) enterprises had ceased trading either temporarily or permanently on 3 May 2020.<\/p><p>- Almost a quarter (23.0%) of enterprises closed temporarily while 0.9% closed permanently.<\/p><p>- More than three in four (76.0%) of responding enterprises were continuing to trade in some capacity on 3rd May 2020. <\/p><p>- Among the enterprises who responded to both waves of the survey, one in six of those who had ceased trading temporarily by 19 April indicated that they had recommenced trading by 3 May.<\/p><p>Of note also is that:<\/p><p>- Two-thirds of Construction enterprises ceased trading either temporarily or permanently. Again, one would expect this to decrease arising from the return of construction activities in Phase 1 of the Roadmap.<\/p><p>- Seven in ten enterprises had lower turnover due to COVID-19 over the two-week period from 20 April to 3 May 2020.<\/p><p>- Exports decreased for over half of responding enterprises.<\/p><p>- Almost half of responding enterprises expressed confidence in having financial resources to continue operating for longer than six months.<\/p><p>- Over half of enterprises availed of Government supports schemes.<\/p><p>- Social distancing in the workplace implemented by over half of respondents. Over half (53.2%) of responding enterprises had implemented working arrangements to facilitate social distancing in the workplace at some point during the COVID-19 crisis. This rose to 77.4% of enterprises in the Manufacturing sector.<\/p><p>Turning to the issue of inspection and enforcement, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the national Return to Work Safely Protocol. It will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate and as provided for in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.<\/p><p>The HSA is deploying all of its available field inspectors across all sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol. However, the Government will ensure that the HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace\/business inspection responsibilities. <\/p><p>While details of these additional resources are currently being finalised, the numbers working with the HSA will be in the hundreds, from across the system.  These will be specialist officials who already have sectoral business inspection responsibilities. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has given a commitment that inspectors from his Department will work with the HSA to ensure the implementation of the Protocol in workplaces. Compliance with the COVID-19 Return to Work Safely Protocol will become part of the normal inspection regime. It will start shortly with around 200 officials from the Environmental Health Service, and this number will increase steadily as officials from other parts of the system, with varying sectoral inspection and oversight responsibilities are brought on board, in line with the Government Roadmap. The details are being finalised at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1265,"content":"<p>Question No. 451 answered with Question No. 442.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1267,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[7986\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if businesses selling hemp products are excluded from the range of Covid-19 business grants available through Enterprise Ireland; if so, the reason for such an exclusion; if she will reconsider the eligibility for the grant in view of the fact these companies are also negatively affected by Covid-19; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1268,"content":"<p>I understand that Enterprise Ireland is currently not in a position to support companies active in the area of cannabis-based products.

Therefore an analysis of the type referred to in the question, including as regards impacts on the housing market, has not been undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  One area of involvement, through Enterprise Ireland, is in he promotion and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise. In this regard, Enterprise Ireland supports a limited number of firms (approximately 750 out of a total of 50,000 construction enterprises) with construction products and services looking to engage with international markets. <\/p>  <p>  In an effort to realise the potential of digital tools and processes within Ireland&rsquo;s construction sector and improve productivity, Enterprise Ireland has played a lead role in supporting the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in recent years &ndash; including its initial convening of the National BIM Council in 2016. This has largely been driven by the increasing requirement for BIM in international markets, and the need to equip the Enterprise Ireland client base, as well as potential exporters, with the competencies necessary to engage with markets in which BIM adoption is standard.<\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out a gradual easing of restrictions with Phase 1 including a phased return of outdoor workers including construction workers. The roadmap suggests a gradual reopening of sites with a focus in Phase 1 on site preparation and outdoor work with indoor work accommodated in Phase 2. Social distancing requirements will continue to apply. The construction industry is largely not public facing and can adopt safe work practices in a controlled environment, ensuring all public health guidelines are adhered to. <\/p>  <p>  The reliance of the construction sector on foreign-national labour means there is potential for labour supply shortages as activity recommences if a share of the workforce has left Ireland during the COVID-19 restrictions. The sector also relies heavily on material inputs such as concrete, steel and other building materials and as such it will be important that supply chain issues (e.g. manufacturing, mining\/quarrying, freight transport) do not prevent projects from progressing. Construction activity is also reliant on a functioning planning system (especially important for some strategic projects underway in the multinational sector) and use real estate services as the primary route to market. These interdependent activities, which are components of other sectors, would also need to be active in order to minimise disruptions. Ensuring that bottlenecks in the supply of labour, raw materials and supporting sectors are swiftly addressed will minimise the potential impact on productivity in the construction sector as activity restarts.<\/p>  <p>  In support of the work of the Construction Sector Group - composed of the key Construction stakeholders in the public and private sectors to support the delivery of Project Ireland 2040, and which includes representation from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation - the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform commissioned an international benchmarking and economic analysis of the causes of productivity trends in the construction sector in Ireland. This was prior to the impact of Covid-19 on the Irish and global economies. <\/p>  <p>  This analysis, which is now complete, contains a series of recommendations for enhancing the productivity performance of the Irish Construction sector, and the membership of the Construction Sector Group has approved an action plan to deliver these actions.

If there is no response, or the response is not satisfactory or in the event of receipt of multiple or serious allegations at any one time, an inspector will follow up with the employer. The inspector may then decide that a pre-arranged or unannounced inspection is warranted.  <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that complaints received by the Health and Safety Authority have been followed up and addressed with the employer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1297,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[8022\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB05100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of inspections carried out by the Health and Safety Authority on foot of Covid-19 complaints, inspection requests or other similar correspondence since 12 March 2020.","asker":"1497","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1298,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[8075\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700135#WRBB05200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the number of workplace inspections that have taken place by the Health and Safety Authority since the Covid-19 emergency emerged in March 2020 to ensure worker protection from the virus.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1299,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 462 and 466 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the national Return to Work Safely Protocol.

However, the issues around any possible Irish mechanism are currently under active consideration. <\/p>  <p>  An EU Regulation on Investment Screening is due to take effect from 11 October 2020. The aim of the Regulation is to establish a cooperation framework within the European Union for the screening of foreign direct investments.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulation is a response to growing concerns within Europe about the potential acquisition of, and investment in, strategic European companies by foreign-owned firms that may undermine a Member State&rsquo;s security or public order.   <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes, Investment Screening has recently assumed greater political focus both globally and within Europe as a result of Covid-19. The EU is concerned that strategic European investments are currently experiencing severe economic vulnerability and low share prices and could be vulnerable to being acquired by third countries. As such, Investment Screening has been the subject of recent Guidance from the Commission calling upon Member States that already have an existing screening mechanism in place to make full use of tools available to them under EU and national law to prevent capital flows from non-EU countries that could undermine Europe's security or public order. In the Guidance, the Commission also calls on the remaining Member States to look at establishing a fully-fledged screening mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  While the EU Regulation provides a framework for cooperation through which Member States and the European Commission can exchange information and raise specific concerns about a potential foreign investment, it does not require Member States to adopt or maintain a screening mechanism for foreign direct investment.  It does, however, contain a number of mandatory requirements - including a requirement to nominate national contact points in each Member State and to comply with certain annual reporting requirements. <\/p>  <p>  As I indicated in my response to the Deputy's earlier question on Investment Screening on 27 April last, in advance of the Regulation taking effect in October, my Department has already established a dedicated Unit, the Investment Screening Unit comprising of 2.5 staff members. This Unit has been notified to the European Commission as the designated national contact point for Ireland. The Unit will undertake and fulfil the cooperation and reporting obligations under the Regulation and is also developing a range of policy options for consideration by Government.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this ongoing work on investment screening, my Department has established and chairs an interdepartmental group comprising key Departments that are likely to have an interest in the screening of Investments. A range of bilateral consultations on Investment Screening have also been held with key stakeholders and Government agencies, and the models employed in range of other countries are being examined by officials.<\/p>  <p>  Any formal screening mechanism would need to be designed and tailored so that is appropriate to Ireland&rsquo;s needs while also meeting our obligations under the EU Regulation.  In particular, any mechanism would need to balance Ireland&rsquo;s continued attractiveness as a location for inward investment, with a robust, but proportionate Investment Screening Mechanism that protects security and public order.<\/p>  <p>  A proposal to introduce a screening mechanism would require a Government decision and would also require the introduction of domestic legislation in this regard. As noted, it is intended to bring proposals in this regard before a new Government, when formed, outlining the policy options and the legislative requirements needed to introduce any formal Screening mechanism. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, to further build on our analysis and research, and to ensure that the policy options presented to Government are as comprehensive as possible, my Department undertook a public consultation on Investment Screening. This consultation affords an opportunity to all interested stakeholders to contribute to the development of policy in this area.

It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.<\/p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.

The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th<\/sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grant is equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.<\/p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.

I am keenly aware that some businesses are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.<\/p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank \/ lender will accept.

He referenced this in his announcement of 18<sup>th<\/sup>March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants.

I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.<\/p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants.<\/p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I received a response on 13<sup>th<\/sup>May in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.<\/p><p>I would like to point out that, on 2<sup>nd<\/sup>May, the Government announced an additional suite of measures to further support small, medium and larger business that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. These included:<\/p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver \/ rebate from 2019 (see further information below);<\/p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;<\/p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;<\/p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; and<\/p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.<\/p><p>The issue of supporting fixed costs, including commercial rents, was very much to the fore of our minds when the Government recently introduced the Restart Grant which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with re-opening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. This grant will provide funding to enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business.<\/p><p>The Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th<\/sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.<\/p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at www.gov.ie or on my Department&rsquo;s website ().<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700136#WRCC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700136#WRCC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1348,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[8225\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700136#WRCC03200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she has met an organisation (details supplied) to discuss the way in which its industry will safely reopen; and if not, her plans to do so in the near future.","asker":"1560","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1349,"content":"<p>I met with the organisation concerned by way of Conference Call today, Wednesday 20 May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700136#WRCC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700136#WRCC03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1351,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[8226\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700136#WRCC03500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on the reluctance of banks to loan to SMEs in order for them to commence the process of reopening their businesses in accordance with social distancing guidelines; and the grants that will be made available to the hospitality sector to ensure the industry can maintain itself as the Covid-19 crisis abates while the economic conditions remain precarious.","asker":"1560","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1352,"content":"<p>The Government has worked to put in place a suite of supports to encourage lending through the banks to SMEs, the following supports are available to all eligible business, including the hospitality sector. <\/p><p>The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme both leverage counter-guarantees through the European Investment Bank to provide a significant guarantee to banks on loans to eligible businesses, reducing the risk associated with such lending. On 8 April I announced significant expansions to both schemes.<\/p><p>On 2 May, I announced a new &euro;2bn Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment. It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year. The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of six years. The guarantee structure will reduce the risk exposure to the bank and open up lending which banks may otherwise have considered to be too high a risk.<\/p><p>The Pillar Banks have assured me that they will support businesses through the Covid-19 Crisis, and I continue to meet with them regularly to make sure they are delivering as such. The banks have had to deal with an overwhelming increase in activity since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and this may have caused some delays in dealing with new business loans leading to a perceived reluctance to lend. While the State supported loan guarantee schemes provide risk coverage to the banks, banks do have an obligation to undertake credit assessment of the loans applied for according to their own policy and procedures. In these uncertain times, this poses many complexities. <\/p><p>I must highlight also that for micro-enterprises that have not achieved lending through the banks, application for a loan through Micro Finance Ireland could be considered. Microenterprises can access COVID-19 Business Loans of up to &euro;50,000 from Microfinance Ireland. The terms include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.<\/p><p>In addition, the newly launched &euro;250m Restart Grant allows for direct grant aid to micro and small businesses of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;10,000.

In addition, a significant increase in the number of cases in Ireland as a result of importation could have an impact on public compliance with public health guidance and restrictions.

Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.

As a new virus, the world has been learning as the situation with the virus has evolved and new evidence becomes available.  <\/p><p>The very infectious nature of the COVID-19 virus makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings - an experience replicated internationally. Interrupting transmission of the COVID-19 virus is the main goal of public health measures and it is clear from our experience that the scale of effect of interruption of transmission is influenced by a number of factors. The most important way to protect our older population, whether living at home or in a LTRC setting, has been to reduce the amount of disease present in our community. If we can keep the rate of disease low this means that we protect both the staff and residents in LTRC. The transmission of the virus, particularly in respect of LTRCs is multifactorial and its introduction into any setting could be the result of a number of factors, including it being introduced unknowingly by asymptomatic residents or staff.

A testing and tracing process with sufficient capacity and quick turnaround is one of a number of core criteria in determining when it is safe for countries to reduce restrictive public health measures. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE, together with the Department of Health and other bodies, has worked hard in the last two months to develop Ireland&rsquo;s testing and tracing process, to expand capacity and to reduce turnaround times. <\/p>  <p>  A designated team, led by a senior manager reporting directly to the CEO, has been established in the HSE to oversee the development, management and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s testing and contact tracing process. This includes responsibility for the scaling up of capacity and the speeding up of turnaround times with a clear focus on achieving ambitious targets and continuous improvement. On 14 May the HSE launched its Roadmap for testing and tracing with clear targets and a range of actions to achieve these targets.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made over the last two months. 47 community testing centres have been established; over 40 laboratories are processing tests; 9 new contact tracing centres have been set up and some 1,700 public servants have been trained in contact tracing to support the work of public health departments. A quick testing referral pathway for GPs is in place, and new IT systems have been developed or modified. The HSE advise that it now has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day and median turnaround times have continued to improve.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise these systems and capacity have been developed from a standing start and to recognise the tremendous work which has gone into getting us to the point we are now at. It is also important to recognise the context in which this is happening: Ireland is already testing at a higher rate than most countries and our targets are ambitious. Data published on 18 May shows Ireland ranks 4th highest out of 25 EU+UK countries in terms of tests completed as a percentage of the overall population.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's testing strategy has evolved as our testing capacity has grown. A number of changes have been made to the case definition so that anyone presenting with acute respiratory infection comprising the sudden onset of least one of the following symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) can be referred for testing. A mass testing programme across nursing homes, mental health and disability facilities is nearing completion, and, as of last week, all close contacts of someone with Covid-19 will be automatically referred for testing.

The guidance based on the best available information at the time set out the various procedures to be followed, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Patients with COVID-19 should not be transferred to a LTRC until they had two consecutive tests indicating virus not detected.<\/p>  <p>  - Patients  who  were  symptomatic  and  were  contacts of a confirmed COVID-19  case  should  only  transfer  if  the  persons  had  a test indicating  virus not detected and it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period;<\/p>  <p>  - Patients  who  were  asymptomatic  and  were contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case should only transfer if it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period;<\/p>  <p>  - Transfers  from  hospitals  with  no  evidence of spread of COVID-19 should  proceed  as  normal,  except  patients with respiratory tract infection  meeting  the then criteria for COVID-19 testing &ndash; in those cases  testing  should  be carried out and the result should be virus not-detected before transfer.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the query raised in respect of numbers of patients, this data is not readily available to my Department but I will follow up with the HSE to seek further information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1543,"qnumday":550,"qnumall":"[7495\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to recommence BreastCheck which ceased during the Covid-19 pandemic; the procedures that will be put in place to protect both staff and patients; his further plans to deal with the backlog that occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1614","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1544,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1545,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1546,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[7496\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) can expect an appointment with the audiology department at the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, County Offaly.","asker":"1591","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1547,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March.

The HPRA publishes figures each year on seizures of illegally imported medicines; in 2017, HPRA figures indicated that it detained 740 tablets containing misoprostal or mifepristone, while in 2016, 536 such tablets were detained.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1592,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1593,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[7664\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700140#WRMM05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when day care centres for the elderly or persons with disabilities will reopen in accordance with the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.","asker":"1596","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1594,"content":"<p>The Department of Health and HSE are undertaking work to determine the current level of service delivery in the community and to set out plans, including associated required capacity, to resume services, including day services, in line with the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.

This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices for the first time, including altruistic domestic surrogacy.  The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.<\/p>  <p>  Drafting of the bill is ongoing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  It is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the publication of the Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, the Deputy should be aware that I consider the progression of this legislation to be a priority. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the provisions within the General Scheme do not include the regulation of Irish citizens involved in international commercial surrogacy agreements in other countries.  The Department of Justice and Equality published a guidance document in 2012 on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document issues in relation to children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements entered into outside the State.  The purpose of this document is to provide information to prospective intending parents on the steps necessary to ensure that a child born abroad through a surrogacy arrangement may enter and reside in the State and to secure the best interests of the child.

People living in Long-term Residential Care facilities are particularly vulnerable populations in the context of Covid-19 and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be at a higher risk of being susceptible to infection from this disease and for subsequent adverse outcomes.<\/p><p>This is most likely due to their age, the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions and circumstances where high care support with the activities of daily living is required in collective high physical contact environments. These are characteristics of LTRC in Ireland that make them a high-risk centre for Covid-19 outbreak and contagion across residents and staff. The approach by Government has been public health led in line with data, evidence and best practice as it emerges, through advice from the NPHET. The response to COVID-19 in LTRC is based on preparedness, early recognition, isolation, care and prevention of onward spread. This involves case recognition, testing, contact tracing and examining disease patterns including mortality. The actions and measures we have taken in Ireland to support nursing homes and their residents have been taken, and have evolved on foot of, epidemiological data and guidance from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). These measures have been both society wide (e.g. cocooning), as well as focused specifically on residential facilities.<\/p><p>The scope of LTRC covers older people, disability and mental health residential care settings. LTRC facilities provide long-term care and short stay, transitional care and respite support either through the State, the voluntary sector or privately. On 10th March 2020 Interim Guidance on Transfer between Care Facilities was circulated and through HIQA was circulated directly to all LTRC registered centres. On the 11th March 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic and the following day the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) published its 6th update to its Rapid Risk Assessment (RRA), 12th March 2020, including new guidance in relation to the implementation of social distancing measures and prevention and control priorities in relation to inter alia LTRCs.  On the same day as the ECDC update, NPHET recommended that Ireland move to &ldquo;delay phase&rdquo; and social distancing measures were recommended and announced, including:<\/p><p>-  Visiting restrictions in long-term care facilities;<\/p><p>-  Individuals who have symptoms should self-isolate for a period of 14 days;<\/p><p>-  Staggered breaks in work and greater remote working etc.<\/p><p>The Government's COVID-19 Action Plan was published on 16th March 2020 and included key actions relating to the protection of vulnerable groups in community settings, including long-term care settings, through maintenance of existing services and enhanced support actions.<\/p><p>Preliminary Clinical and Infection Control Guidance for COVID-19 in nurse-led Residential Care Facilities (RCF) was published by the HSE and circulated to the nursing homes sector on 17th March 2020. The document provides guidance on general measures to reduce the risk of accidental introduction of COVID-19 into a LTRC, procedures to be followed for clinically suspect residents; guidance on clinical investigations and monitoring and on IPC. The document also provides detailed step-by-step instructions across a range of scenarios.<\/p><p>As the disease has progressed, a range of enhanced measures for nursing homes have been recommended by NPHET which are now being implemented by relevant agencies.<\/p><p>Each HSE CHO Area Crisis Management Team (ACMT) has prioritised the needs of all long-term care residents within their areas and has also offered very significant support to the nursing homes in their areas, particularly those with COVID 19 outbreaks. Guidance on the set up of COVID Response Teams was issued on 9th April to support all LTRCs within a CHO area and 23 COVID Response Teams are now in place across the 9 CHO areas. These teams are actively supporting all centres with outbreaks in their area through operational guidance and infection prevention and control (IPC) and Clinical support by Geriatricians etc, and in the most at-risk centres, staff are being deployed or sourced to ensure ongoing safe service delivery. <\/p><p>The establishment and provision of accommodation supports for staff who are living in congregated arrangements has been implemented with approximately 2,000 beds occupied per week.<\/p><p>To support designated centres HIQA set up an Infection Prevention and Control Hub providing support to providers and staff via email and phone.

Vaccination would commence in areas where successful field trials had already taken place with a view to gradually rolling it out to other parts of the country over time.  As I stated then, my view is that this marks a major step forward in the bovine TB eradication programme, enabling Ireland to work towards the eradication of bovine TB in a controlled holistic way, which will serve to protect the badger population whilst also protecting cattle and the livelihoods of farmers.<\/p><p>The Deputy should be aware, however, that some level of badger culling in response to severe TB episodes will still be required.  Badger culling contributed significantly to the very considerable improvement in the disease situation nationally in recent years.  However, culling of badgers is not sustainable in the long term given its ultimate impact on badger ecology and Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Berne convention. The vaccination trials referred to, carried out between 2013 and 2017, took place following 15 years of research work using BCG vaccine to prevent tuberculosis infection in badgers.  The peer-reviewed published trials demonstrated that vaccination is no less effective than culling.  Badger vaccination will therefore represent a fundamental part of the TB Wildlife Programme and allow for a reduction in the numbers of badgers being culled over the coming years while still maintaining effective control of the risk posed to cattle.  <\/p><p>In 2019, vaccination Technical Team Co-ordinators were appointed by my Department and training of staff in all offices was also carried out.  The areas that were chosen in this first large extension of vaccination were those areas that had lower incidence of bovine TB and where the areas had been prepared for changeover to vaccination by lowering badger densities as a result of ongoing badger removal.  The result of this was that, in late 2019, most counties in the country had areas within them that changed over to vaccination.  The changeover in late 2019 represented an increase of the area subject to vaccination increasing from 7,887km<sup>2<\/sup>to 17,748km<sup>2<\/sup>and it is intended to continue to increase the area under vaccination in the coming years.<\/p><p>Recent IT improvements now allow for every badger in the vaccination area to be recorded electronically when and where it is captured and vaccinated.  Currently, approximately 70% of badgers being captured in vaccination areas are new captures and have not been vaccinated previously.  This is expected to fall over time as greater population penetration is achieved.  Of the 1,870 badgers that were captured in the vaccination area last year, 1,391 were vaccinated with BCG, 42 were removed for epidemiological reasons, 434 had been previously vaccinated and 3 were euthanized for health reasons. Badger vaccination efforts vary from region to region at different times of the year based on disease risk and disease priorities.<\/p><p>The numbers of badgers vaccinated by County for 2019 and for the first six weeks of 2020 are set out in the following table.

The Scheme provides 100% of establishment grants with annual premiums for up to 15 years, depending on the species chosen.  Landowners considering forestry should contact a registered forester who will complete the application on their behalf.  Further information is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, including rates payable and a list of registered foresters.<\/p>  <p>  A wide variety of schemes are specifically focussed on  the establishment and management of forests that deliver significant biodiversity benefits. The Native Woodland Establishment Scheme supports the planting of new native woodland and the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme aims to conserve existing native woodland and help to convert conifer stands to native woodland at key locations. In addition, the Woodland Environmental Fund, launched in 2018, encourages businesses to get involved in encouraging private landowners to take up the Native Woodland Establishment Scheme. Business provide a &lsquo;top up&rsquo; payment of &euro;1,000\/ha to the landowner as a further incentive to convert from agriculture to native woodland. So far, Microsoft, Aldi, Lidl, An Post, Accenture and KBI Global Investment have participated in the fund. <\/p>  <p>  Support measures for the sustainable management of forests, with the added benefit of increasing biodiversity, are also funded by my Department. The Continuous Cover Forestry scheme redirects plantations away from the 'normal' clear fell \/ reforestation model and into continuous cover forestry. As trees are felled singly or in small groups (typically with smaller machinery) and the gaps left are planted up or fill in with natural regeneration, the overall canopy cover is left intact, protecting the soil and the woodland ecosystem. The  Woodland Improvement Thinning and Tending Scheme for broadleaves aims to improve the quality and value of retained trees by removing poorer quality stems and redirecting growth onto better quality ones. This delivers a biodiversity benefit as it will open up the canopy and allow increased levels of light infiltration onto the forest floor, encouraging ground vegetation and the scrub understory. This increase in habitat biodiversity leads to more insects and birds in these more diverse habitats. Protection of this grounded vegetation and scrub layer is further supported by the  Deer Fencing Scheme. Excluding deer also allows the natural regeneration of trees and scrubs, as seed falling onto the site can germinate and become established, which increases the woodland biodiversity generally.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the important role bees play within agriculture and for biodiversity as both pollinators and honey producers, by providing a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the beekeeping associations.<\/p>  <p>  Support to the beekeeping sector in Ireland is provided through the National Apiculture Programme, which provides funding to carry out applied research for the Irish apiculture sector.  The Commercial Horticulture grant aid scheme provides grant aid towards capital investments in specialised beekeeping equipment and also contributes annual grants to Irish National Beekeepers associations to help their associated members and branches to pursue the craft of beekeeping to the highest standards and to also inform the general public about the environmental role that bees play in maintaining Irish biodiversity and crop production. Owners of native woodland  are also encouraged to contact local bee-keepers and to offer to 'host-a-hive' within their woodland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700145#WRRR03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1866,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700145#WRRR04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1867,"qnumday":661,"qnumall":"[7546\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700145#WRRR04100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the basis of the proposed payment rate for the Covid-19 voluntary fleet tie-up scheme; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the scheme is not sufficient to meet the loss of business and debts of fishermen affected; if he will convene a fresh round of talks with representatives of the fishing sector relating to the scheme and broader sectorial issues caused by Covid-19 and Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1454"},{"type":"question","counter":1868,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[7606\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700145#WRRR04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied that the level of financial support being offered to owners of fishing vessels to support them through the Covid-19 crisis compares favourably with the financial supports being offered by other EU states and the UK Government.","asker":"1463","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":1869,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 661 and 663 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary objective for the fishing sector throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic has been to maintain fishing activity in  order to ensure critical food supply lines to the domestic and European markets. For this reason, from the outset the Government classified fishing as an essential service and kept the fishery harbours and related support services open throughout the Pandemic. This remains the primary Government objective in relation to the fishing sector.<\/p>  <p>  There has been significant and sustained offshore fishing activity by the Irish fleet over the past three months. This has been helped by the fact that the price of oil, a critical cost factor for the fleet, has reduced dramatically. Together with good fishing weather, these factors have greatly assisted the viability of fishing operations, notwithstanding reduced market prices for fish.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie up Scheme is simply designed as a safety net scheme to provide a further option to fishermen who choose not to continue fishing. It is not designed as a replacement for viable fishing activity, wherever those possibilities exist. To date, most Irish offshore fishing vessels have continued to fish. As European and Asian markets gradually begin to open up, as is happening at present, it is likely that demand and prices will continue to improve and, in those circumstances, many fishermen will continue to choose to fish and not to avail of the scheme. The Temporary Tie up Scheme, as a safety net scheme, is not designed to attract all fishermen or to bring all fishing activity to a halt. <\/p>  <p>  Fishermen have been and will continue to be able to avail of the horizontal Government Covid-19 supports, such as the Pandemic Unemployment Benefit, the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the banking arrangements. Those horizontal supports continue to be available to the fishing sector and the Temporary Tie up Scheme is a further complementary and additional support to fishermen who choose not to continue fishing. The Scheme is not intended as an income replacement scheme for fishing vessel owners. The Scheme is intended to contribute towards the fixed costs associated with fishing vessels of various sizes that voluntarily choose to tie-up. The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme range from &euro;6,000 per month for a maximum of two months for the very largest vessels over 24 metres to &euro;500 per month for a maximum of two months for the very smallest vessels under 6 metres in length. Those support levels are in line with the fixed costs reported by the fleet to BIM through the EU Data Collection Framework.<\/p>  <p>  It is up to each fishing vessel owner to decide whether to tie-up for a month or two or to keep fishing and in line with the Government policy of keeping the food chain operating. It is, of course, preferable that the supply of fish continues to satisfy available markets.<\/p>  <p>  In general, fishing vessel owners want their vessels to be at sea and fishing. The Scheme was capped at a maximum of 66% of each vessel size category in the fleet to ensure a continued level of fishing activity.  To assist the continuation of fishing activity over the coming period, generous vessel quota allocations are being made for the month of June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700145#WRRR04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Issues","counter":1870,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700145#WRRR04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1871,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[7605\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700145#WRRR04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the construction of a road approximately 400 metres in length along the foreshore of Lough Foyle at Clar, Redcastle, County Donegal without planning or consultation; and if his Department can co-operate with the Loughs Agency to protect the foreshore of Lough Foyle on the Inishowen side.","asker":"1463","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":1872,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for foreshore licensing in respect of structures\/activities relating to fisheries and aquaculture and in respect of relevant structures\/activities in designated Fishery Harbour Centres.

Should any application for funding be submitted by a Local Authority under any future programme in relation to the installation of a sea bin, it will be given due consideration, taking into account the terms and conditions of the scheme, the priority attached by the Council and available funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700146#WRSS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme","counter":1889,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700146#WRSS00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1890,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[7824\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700146#WRSS00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of applications to the 2020 national reserve and young farmers scheme by county in tabular form.","asker":"1546","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":1891,"content":"<p>The number of applications to the 2020 National Reserve and the 2020 Young Farmers Scheme, by county, is set out in the table below.

They also participate in cross-Departmental mechanisms to ensure that appropriate and effective supports are available to all businesses.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the challenges currently faced by agri food businesses, I have engaged with the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period.

The advice is that farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cashflow issues. I welcomed the recent announcement by Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland that their members, including the five main retail banks, have extended their payment break from three months to six months for those directly impacted by Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of supports, agri-food businesses are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally.

There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulations articles.<\/p>  <p>  In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006\/130\/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.<\/p>  <p>  There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019\/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.  For example, antiparasitic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019\/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website www.hpra.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019\/6. It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with existing national legislation, antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and licensed merchants. This means that all current stakeholders that are already permitted to supply such products will be entitled to continue to stock them in the future but from January 2022 onwards, a veterinary prescription will be needed to dispense them.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products and plan to have a public consultation in Q2 2020. A dedicated email address has been set up for this purpose and I would encourage all interested parties to send their  observations to vetmedregs@agriculture.gov.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700146#WRSS04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme","counter":1926,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700146#WRSS04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1927,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[7911\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700146#WRSS04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if farm lands with designations such as special area of conservation, special protected area, natural heritage area will be eligible for the basic payment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":1928,"content":"<p>EU Regulations governing the Basic Payment Scheme require that for agricultural land to be deemed eligible for payment, it must be subject to an agricultural activity.

On 31st March, my Department informed each licensed livestock mart that they could put in place alternative trade facilitation mechanisms that would support the orderly sale of animals necessary to support the essential business of farming. Any livestock mart wishing to engage in limited activities to facilitate the buying and selling of livestock was asked to submit for approval a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) demonstrating to the Department&rsquo;s satisfaction that the individual mart would be in a position to operate in full compliance with HSE guidelines in relation to hygiene and physical distancing. 80 of the 86 licensed marts submitted SOPs, and were approved to operate. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage constructively with marts and representative organisations. In recent weeks a lot of preparatory work has been done, so that when considered appropriate in the context of the broader approach to Covid-19, further activities in marts can be facilitated while continuing to ensure the safety of mart staff and clients.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the financial challenges currently faced by marts, I have engaged with the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period. All the banks have announced that they will offer flexibility to their customers, and that they may be able to provide payment breaks or emergency working capital facilities. The advice is that farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cash flow issues. I welcomed the recent announcement by Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland that their members, including the five main retail banks, have extended their payment break from three months to six months for those directly impacted by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of supports, agri-food businesses, including marts, are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally. This includes the National COVID-19 Income Support Scheme, encompassing both the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme and the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The &euro;250 million SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, co-financed by my Department, has also been deployed to address liquidity and financing needs of eligible businesses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. For smaller businesses of less than 10 employees, Microfinance Ireland is also offering a COVID-19 Business Loan, providing working capital loans up to &euro;50,000. The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS), also co-financed by my Department, was launched last year and made &euro;300m of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses. Loans are competitively priced, for terms of 8-10 years, and support strategic long-term investment. As a result of the significant and sudden financial impact of the pandemic on businesses a second tranche of &euro;200million, with up to 40% available to the agri-food sector, will be made available through the banks, with details to be announced shortly. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has announced agreement of a further suite of measures to further support businesses that are negatively impacted by Covid-19.

The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  This will lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and to more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p><p>An important aspect of the work to achieve and maintain MSY is to form a detailed picture of the biological status of the stocks of the stocks which are fished by our fleet. Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute with data from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2019, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. I have attached two tables (Tables 1 and 2) taken from the Stock Book that show the fluctuations of fish stocks over the last five years.<\/p><p>Of these 74 stocks, 35 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2019. This number has grown every year since 2013. The number of stocks being over-fished has declined from 22 in 2014 to 13 in 2019.  In the five year period referred to by the Deputy, the number of stocks fished sustainably has consistently increased, while those over fished have declined. These trends should ultimately lead to healthier fish stocks and higher quotas for Irish fishermen.<\/p><p>Fishing opportunities for each Member State are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. This, in turn, can lead to fluctuations in quotas, both increases and decreases.  At the negotiations for 2020 Total Allowable Catches and quotas, there were increases in a number of stocks of importance to Ireland such as Haddock, Monkfish and Megrim in the Celtic Sea. This outcome shows that the many years of intensive, industry-led conservation measures are paying off.  I am confident that, through the CFP, we will be able to ensure the sustainability of our fish stocks.  This will ensure the economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.<\/p><p>Fish stocks in inland waterways fall with the remit of the Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment and its agency Inland Fisheries Ireland. <\/p><p><b>Table 1<\/b>Summary of FEAS evaluation of fishing mortality in relation to FMSY for stocks of interest to Ireland. <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2015<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2016<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2017<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2018<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2019<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Pressure status<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fished Below Fmsy<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>36<\/td>       <td>28<\/td>       <td>38<\/td>       <td>29<\/td>       <td>39<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>       <td>43<\/td>       <td>35<\/td>       <td>47<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Fished Above Fmsy<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>       <td>23<\/td>       <td>16<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>F Unknown, Fmsy or not defined<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>       <td>38<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>       <td>42<\/td>       <td>28<\/td>       <td>38<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>35<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>35<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Number of Stocks<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>72<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>74<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>74<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>74<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>74<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Table 2 Summary of FEAS evaluation of SSB in relation to biomass reference points for stocks of interest to Ireland. <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2015<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2016<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2017<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2018<\/th>       <th colspan=\"2\">2019<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass status<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>       <td>Num<\/td>       <td>%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass above MSY Btrigger<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>       <td>28<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>30<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>       <td>36<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>35<\/td>       <td>25<\/td>       <td>34<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass below MSY Btrigger<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>       <td>16<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass Unknown or undefined <\/td>       <td>38<\/td>       <td>53<\/td>       <td>33<\/td>       <td>45<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>       <td>43<\/td>       <td>32<\/td>       <td>43<\/td>       <td>34<\/td>       <td>46<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Number of Stocks<\/td>       <td colspan=\"2\">72<\/td>       <td colspan=\"2\">74<\/td>       <td colspan=\"2\">74<\/td>       <td colspan=\"2\">74<\/td>       <td colspan=\"2\">74<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700147#WRTT02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1454"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":1967,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700147#WRTT03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1968,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[8240\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700147#WRTT03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will address the numerous issues raised with him by the forestry industry regarding licences for forestry operations; his views on whether there is a crisis situation in the industry; if so, the way in which he plans to address it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1454"},{"type":"speech","counter":1969,"content":"<p>I am aware that there are currently delays to issuing forestry licences and acknowledge that this is causing difficulties for some in the sector.  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. <\/p>  <p>  The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that  in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. As you know, my Department is the forestry licence consent authority and, since 2017, all licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences. It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.  In order to fully implement this system and to issue licences within accepted timescales, my Department is devoting extra resources to deliver these new procedures, as follows:  <\/p>  <p>  -  New forestry inspectors and additional administrative staff have been assigned to licensing. More forestry inspectors will be recruited in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  -  Two new ecologists have joined the Department ecology team, with four more to be appointed shortly.<\/p>  <p>  -  We have engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists have also been contracted provide extra support.  Further, an ecology contract with five new ecologists is due to be signed very soon.<\/p>  <p>  -  Additional administrative staff have been assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload of the Forestry Appeals Committee.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Three planning officers have been contracted in to work with the Forestry Appeals Committee.<\/p>  <p>  -  A specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry issues.<\/p>  <p>  To date in 2020, 719 tree felling licences have issued with a volume of 1.8 million m3.  In terms of afforestation licences processed, my Department has issued 248 afforestation licences for 1,859ha and 155 forest road works licences for 56km of forest roads, for the year to 22nd May 2020.  Furthermore, from January 2018 to the end of March 2020, there are valid afforestation licences for some 3,300ha that have not progressed to planting.  I would encourage landowners with valid afforestation licences to plant their land this year.  They will then access the premiums available under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I have an unwavering commitment to supporting the forestry sector and this commitment has been borne out during the current pandemic.  Forestry licensing has been deemed an essential service during the Covid-19 outbreak.

The potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to maximise their commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. Importantly, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with EU law. <\/p><p>An example of airplay quotas in the EU can be seen in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations, this quota was reduced to 35% in 2016. Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position. However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music produced in a particular place, as suggested in this question, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law. Therefore, without a similar justification on the grounds of promoting cultural diversity, a quota for music produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.<\/p><p>The government is not currently considering airplay quotas based on production location<font color=\"#1F497D\">.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700148#WRUU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1549"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":1994,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700148#WRUU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1995,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[7089\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700148#WRUU01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when broadband will be available in an area (details supplied).","asker":"1503","askee":"1549"},{"type":"speech","counter":1996,"content":"<p>The government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Question refers to a premises which is located in the AMBER area on the NBP High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website at www.broadband.gov.ie.

Since 2000, approximately 400,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light. Approximately &euro;120 million has been allocated to residential and community energy efficiency schemes in 2020.  The SEAI and Department monitor the impact of the schemes on an ongoing basis.   <\/p>  <p>  The primary aim of the Warmer Homes Scheme is to address energy poverty by delivering energy efficiency measures to those homeowners deemed to be in, or at risk of, such poverty.  The programme delivers many benefits to homeowners including improved comfort, quality of life, and health.  Since 2000, the scheme has provided upgrades to over 142,000 homes across Ireland, improving the lives of some of Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens. The Scheme underwent a significant change in mid-2018, expanding to include more extensive measures, including external wall insulation which is now funded under the scheme. This has resulted in deeper retrofits and greater energy savings for homeowners.  In 2018, 77% of homes upgraded under the scheme saw at least one energy consumption classification change. <\/p>  <p>  A recently published audit conducted by the European Court of Auditors assessed whether EU co-funded energy efficiency investments in buildings, including under Ireland&rsquo;s Warmer Homes Scheme, had cost-effectively helped the EU toward its 2020 energy saving target.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the scope of the Court of Auditors report addresses EU funding of the scheme over the period 2014-2018 in terms of energy efficiency only and not other benefits such as energy poverty reductions, which is the primary aim of the Warmer Homes Scheme.  Furthermore, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently undertaking a social impact assessment of the SEAI&rsquo;s energy poverty schemes, including the Warmer Homes Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030.

As reflected in the Government's policy statement on the matter - which was published in September 2017 - the Bill provides for the establishment of a newly reconstituted regulatory Irish Aviation Authority - merging the  safety and security regulatory functions of the current IAA with the economic regulation and consumer affairs functions of the Commission for Aviation Regulation. This will create a single aviation regulator, and it will represent an important modernisation and strengthening of aviation regulation in Ireland. The draft Bill also provides for the establishment of a completely separate, commercial State-owned air navigation service provider. This new company will operate as a regulated commercial entity, and for so long as it continues to make a profit - noting that it is a State monopoly - it will continue to pay the State annual dividends.<\/p>  <p>  Being very much an outlier internationally, the institutional separation of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation regulatory and commercial air navigation service provision functions is important. It is an old model, which was put in place in the early 1990s and has remained largely unchanged since. The industry and what constitutes effective regulation has moved on. The reforms I have set in motion are in line with international best practice, and they will enhance the State&rsquo;s aviation sector through the establishment of a stronger and more robust regulatory environment. While progress has been made on the legislative front, I have been less happy with the pace of preparation in the IAA to prepare for the changes, and I have made that clear to the Board and the management.  <\/p>  <p>  These benefits of the reform, and the broad stakeholder support for it, were recently underlined in a report on the safety performance of the IAA, which I commissioned under Section 32 of the IAA Act 1993. This report noted, as I have raised myself, that the progress on the reform project has not been achieved as quickly as expected.  <\/p>  <p>  When the time comes to publish the Bill and seek Oireachtas endorsement, I am confident that this is one of those legislative proposals that will lend itself to broad political support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700152#WRZZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700152#WRZZ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2155,"qnumday":760,"qnumall":"[7345\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700152#WRZZ01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the guidelines for driving instructors with regard to returning to work; when they will be able to return to work; the precautions they will need to take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2156,"content":"<p>Driving lessons are provided by self-employed private individuals or companies, and they have a responsibility to ensure that they can comply with the necessary public health requirements before they can reopen their businesses.

When the new central Irish Register of Ships is in place and the 2014 Act is commenced, I will be open to considering the case for a particular port to be made a port of registry that is made on the basis of the framework set out in the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Pending the commencement of the 2014 Act, I have no plans to review the list of ports of registry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700155#WRCCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2346,"content":"<p>Question No. 824 answered with Question No. 820.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":2347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700155#WRCCC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2348,"qnumday":825,"qnumall":"[7896\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700155#WRCCC03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if emergency driver test appointments will be provided for persons whose planned tests were cancelled due to Covid-19, who are categorised as essential workers and who urgently need to do a test in order to be able to drive legally to get to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2349,"content":"<p>The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  <\/p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing will be of particular concern to learner drivers.

The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care and school-age childcare systems, funding and quality; economics; and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments which will be involved in implementing the new Funding Model. A research partner, Frontier Economics, has been appointed to support the work of the Expert Group.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent data on pay and conditions in the sector indicates that the average pay is influenced by the level of a practitioner&rsquo;s qualifications. For example, the average pay rates for graduate workers is somewhat higher than for others working in the sector. Practitioners with Level 5 and Level 6 qualifications earned an average of &euro;11.42 and &euro;12.63 respectively in 2019. The average rates of pay for graduates at that time were &euro;13.93 for those with qualifications at Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications, &euro;13.45 for those with Level 8 qualifications, and &euro;15.18 for those with qualifications at Levels 9 or 10. Overall, the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare was &euro;12.55, which was 3% higher than the year before. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare, resulting in a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  I have actively encouraged the sector to seek a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO). An SEO must be initiated by a grouping representing the sector and my Department is ready to input to such a process, if and when the sector seeks it. Organisations requesting the commencement of such a process must show they are substantially representative of the sector. An SEO would provide for mandatory terms and conditions in the early learning and care and school age childcare sector, minimum rates of remuneration, and other conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in continuous professional development (CPD).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700156#WRDDD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","counter":2425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700156#WRDDD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2426,"qnumday":854,"qnumall":"[8158\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700156#WRDDD04700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if an independent public enquiry into an organisation (details supplied) will be initiated.","asker":"1495","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2427,"content":"<p>The initiation of any independent inquiry is a very significant matter and one which will require careful consideration.   <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have previously taken a number of actions in response to allegations of poor safeguarding policies and practice in Scouting Ireland.

This was published on 8th May and confirmed that all of Ms Van Turnhout&rsquo;s recommendations had been satisfactorily implemented, while outlining a small number of matters for follow up. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the publication by Mr. Elliott of his learning review into historical sexual abuse in scouting.  My thoughts are with the adults who suffered so gravely as children through their involvement with scouting and who have carried this burden with them into their adult lives.   <\/p>  <p>  I met with Mr Elliott, following receipt of his review, and was pleased to hear that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the findings, he was very positive about the current governance arrangements in Scouting Ireland, with a Board that is strong and well-functioning, and with robust safeguarding in place.  Tusla has also written to the Department to indicate its satisfaction with current safeguarding practice in Scouting Ireland, particularly as it relates to the agreed Scouting Ireland \/ Tusla Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Government had previously undertaken to give careful consideration to the question of an appropriate statutory investigation following the RT&Eacute; Investigates programme &ldquo;Scouts Dishonour&rdquo;. It was appropriate for Government to await the reports from Ms Brigid McManus and Mr Ian Elliott to inform this consideration.  In this regard, it is noted that Mr Elliott&rsquo;s report suggests that a statutory inquiry may face the same limitations as his Learning Review.  Mr Elliott has also emphasised the cooperation of Scouting Ireland in relation to his review.  As such, a key factor is whether a statutory or public inquiry would uncover new information.  This is something which will need to be taken into account in contemplating the question of an inquiry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700156#WRDDD04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Attendance","counter":2428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700156#WRDDD04850"},{"type":"question","counter":2429,"qnumday":855,"qnumall":"[8219\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700156#WRDDD04875","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to waive compulsory attendance with regard to primary, secondary and third-level courses (details supplied).","asker":"1560","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2430,"content":"<p>The Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) has statutory responsibility under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 for ensuring all children attend school regularly.

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. <\/p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC\/SAC services are stated as follows: <\/p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. <\/p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues. My Department has sought public health advice in relation to the plans being put forward. Informed by this advice, consideration is being given to a range of these issues. This includes minimising  the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, and the impacts that a potential change to staff ratio requirements would have on capacity, sustainability, and staff recruitment and retention. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it is vital that we, ensure that any restrictions are consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and development needs and for ELC and  SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred.<\/p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15, 19 and 26 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  I am also establishing a Reference Group to widen the scope of consultation with the ELC and SAC sector, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group and to give an opportunity to provider representatives who are not represented on this group to make their views known to me and my officials. I hope to hold periodic meetings of the Group as we work through the phased reopening of the ELC and SAC sector. The first meeting of the Reference Group will be held on Thursday, 28 May 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are at an advanced stage will have due regard to public health guidance over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. <\/p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every ELC and SAC service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from 29 June in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  <\/p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.

While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.<\/p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to public health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. <\/p>  <p>  I have already put in place a number of supports to assist ELC and SAC providers in this time. TheTemporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS), launched by my Department on 15 April, builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. It provides funds for staffing and overhead costs, while ensuring that parents are not charged fees for the duration of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  As part of pre-existing sustainability funding, financial supports are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  My Department has begun to consider whether this sustainability funding can be extended to private services during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  These sector-specific supports are complemented by the range of supports across Government, many of which can also be availed of by ELC and SAC providers. This includes grants and loans for small businesses, advice and support from Local Enterprise Offices, the cancellation of commercial rates for a period, and a re-opening grant for small and medium enterprises. Further information on these supports is available from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports.

Investment in ELC and SAC has increased by 141% over the last five years. This has enabled us deliver, for example, a second year of free pre-school to all children, the international award winning Access and Inclusion Model for children with disabilities, a doubling of the number of children in receipt of subsidies, an increase in the number of places by approximately 60%, and the highly innovative and progressive National Childcare Scheme.  However, I acknowledge that regardless of the positive strides made, more investment is  needed.  Historic under investment in ELC and SAC has created a situation that has no quick solution. <\/p><p>In terms of policy approaches, my Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in <i>First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2019-2028<\/i>. A key vehicle to ensure that significant additional investment in the sector delivers for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model. This new Funding Model will provide mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ELC and SAC providers to ensure greater levels of affordability, quality and inclusion in their services.<\/p><p>An Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC was announced in September 2019 and commenced its work in October 2019.  The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference includes to:<\/p><p>- Agree a set of guiding principles to underpin the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC<\/p><p>- Review the existing approach to funding ELC and SAC services by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of its alignment with the guiding principles as well as effectiveness in delivering on the policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage<\/p><p>- Drawing on international evidence, identify and consider options on how additional funding for ELC and SAC could be structured to deliver on the guiding principles and above policy objectives<\/p><p>- Agree a final report including a proposed design for a new Funding Model, with accompanying costings, risk analysis and mitigation and phased implementation plan (with funding likely to become available on an incremental basis) to recommend to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and ultimately Government.<\/p><p>The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding and quality; economics; and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments which will be involved in implementing the new Funding Model. A research partner, Frontier Economics, has been appointed to support the work of the Expert Group.<\/p><p>A consultation and engagement process to take account of the voices of providers, practitioners, parents and other stakeholders within the sector had to be postponed due to COVID-19. Further information on the Funding Model and its progress is available at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie<\/p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation that has required a series of emergency responses from the Government. I am acutely aware of the particular impact this has had on ELC and SAC providers, practitioners, parents and children. I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis. <\/p><p>As a direct response to the COVID-19 closure of ELC and SAC services, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) which is a very significant measure to support the sector. The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: <\/p><p>- to support the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; <\/p><p>- to provide parents with a reassurance that if their ELC and SAC provider signs up to the scheme, they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, and they will maintain their ELC \/ SAC place when services resume and<\/p><p>- to give Early Learning and Care practitioners security and to retain these vital Educators in the sector.<\/p><p>The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. <\/p><p>Overall, Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in ELC and SAC. Additional investment of &euro;63.6m brought investment to &euro;638m in 2020, as noted a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure these policy outcomes. <\/p><p>My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years. I want to preserve the fruits of this investment for children, families and our much valued ELC and SAC workforce and ensure that, when COVID- 19 has passed, we will have retained as many services, staff and places as possible and that we are moving progressively towards the vision outlined in First 5 which was unanimously welcomed by all stakeholders.<\/p><p>I welcome a recent evaluation by the European Commission which noted that substantial progress had been made in recent years in the area of childcare. It recognised the systemic, comprehensive and strategic cross Government approach that had been adopted, the development of important legislation in the area and the solid plans for the future.  My Department remains committed to maintaining this momentum and transforming early learning and care to a system that is truly accessible, affordable and of high quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700157#WREEE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":2462,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700157#WREEE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2463,"qnumday":866,"qnumall":"[7475\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700157#WREEE03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when promised childcare for front-line workers will be provided; and if the facilitation of spouses of frontline workers working in public service to be offered paid leave to care for their children has been ruled out.","asker":"1596","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2464,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Temporary Childcare Scheme for Essential Health Workers was cancelled on the 13th May. <\/p><p>My primary focus now, and that of my Department, is to work towards the significant challenges of a phased reopening of early learning and childcare facilities for 29th June, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. <\/p><p>Identifying essential workers, as referred to by the Deputy, is part of the wider Government effort to ensure that society and businesses are re-opened in a carefully managed and safe manner.<\/p><p>The facilitation of paid leave for public service employees is not a matter for the DCYA.

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. <\/p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC\/SAC services are stated as follows: <\/p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. <\/p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues. My Department has sought public health advice in relation to the plans being put forward. Informed by this advice, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining  social distancing among young children and those caring for them, <\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s  well-being and development needs and for ELC and  SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred<\/p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for pre-school children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. <\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.<\/p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15, 19 and 26 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  I am also establishing a Reference Group to widen the scope of consultation with the ELC and SAC sector, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group and to give an opportunity to provider representatives who are not represented on this group to make their views known to me and my officials. I hope to hold periodic meetings of the Group as we work through the phased reopening of the ELC and SAC sector. The first meeting of the Reference Group will be held on Thursday, 28 May 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that all circa 2000 ELC and SAC services  around the country which are normally open in July and August are currently considering how they can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how they can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  <\/p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage. I am committed to sharing guidelines and a range of other resources as soon as possible after they have been finalised with the assistance of the Advisory Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700158#WRFFF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":2520,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700158#WRFFF03000"},{"type":"question","counter":2521,"qnumday":887,"qnumall":"[8056\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700158#WRFFF03100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the action she will take to ensure childcare providers insurance includes cover for Covid-19; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1466","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2522,"content":"<p>The Deputy is aware that childcare providers are private sector operators, 75% of which are private companies or sole traders, with 25% being community based services.

In this regard, it is noted that Mr Elliott&rsquo;s report suggests that a statutory inquiry may face the same limitations as his Learning Review.  Mr Elliott has also emphasised the cooperation of Scouting Ireland in relation to his review.  As such, a key factor is whether a statutory or public inquiry would uncover new information.

DCYA is providing Tusla with &euro;25.3m this year for some 60 organisations that deliver services for these victims. This includes funding and coordinated supports for 21 services that provide emergency refuge and non-refuge accommodation to victims of domestic violence.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that there is currently a relatively low demand for refuge, with some vacant units, most likely reflecting challenges for women around access to services in the current context rather than lower levels of need. Levels of demand are however, beginning to rise. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is aware of reduced capacity within some refuges, due to requirements to enforce social distancing or self-isolation measures, particularly where communal facilities may exist. There is also a requirement for additional capacity to address medically advised self-isolation requirements for service users. As facilities, accommodation and arrangements are specific to each service, Tusla is working with individual organisations to address any challenges arising in maintaining essential service provision. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla reports that as of 22 May 2020, 101 of the 139 family units that would usually be available for victims of domestic violence, were also in use or available for use. To mitigate the impact of social distancing and isolation measures, an additional 45 refuge and non-refuge accommodation units for service users have been secured in the community (as of 22 May 2020), through the efforts of local services with support from Tusla.

Tusla has redeployed six members of staff to emergency accommodation services for victims of domestic violence. A total of 18 relief staff are in use across the system, as of 22 May 2020. Tusla has also provided a guidance document to all refuges, mainly in regard to contingency planning in the current health crisis. All guidance is in line with public health guidelines from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and the Health Service Executive (HSE). <\/p>  <p>  It should be emphasised that the current restrictions on movement do not apply to a person escaping from a risk of harm or seeking to access essential services, such as persons experiencing domestic violence. Tusla provides financial support to the Women&rsquo;s Aid and Male Advice helplines, so that anyone experiencing domestic violence can receive assistance and advice at a time of need. <\/p>  <p>  To date, Tusla has provided additional funding of approximately &euro;279,964 across DSGBV services since the commencement of the COVID-19 crisis in Ireland. This includes funding for additional staffing, ICT resources for staff working from home, and access to additional accommodation. The matter of funding will be kept under review,  and Tusla will continue to engage with service providers regarding issues and difficulties that may arise at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700158#WRFFF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":2537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700158#WRFFF04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Burial Grounds","counter":2536,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700158#WRFFF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2537,"qnumday":893,"qnumall":"[7295\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700158#WRFFF04800","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if new schemes have been announced to provide funding to community groups maintaining cemeteries no longer able to carry out maintenance due to social distancing requirements and that can no longer fundraise or raise funds through donations in the community to pay contractors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1500"},{"type":"speech","counter":2538,"content":"<p>Under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 2001, local authorities are deemed to be burial boards for their respective functional areas.

The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or<\/p>  <p>3. Persons with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  Mindful of the difficulties and issues raised by the sector, the Stability Scheme was established to urgently assist organisations at immediate risk of closure.  The application process for the Stability Scheme was designed to avoid placing unnecessary or onerous administrative burdens on the applicant organisations. This was to ensure swift turnaround times to facilitate draw down of funds by eligible applicants so that they may continue to provide critical services to those most in need in our communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The application deadline was extended by one day in order to facilitate those organisations that had technical issues or required clarification on their eligibility. The application process closed at 8pm on Thursday 21st May 2020. The Scheme has received over 1,000 applications and the assessment and approval process is currently underway.

Victims of domestic violence accommodation needs are met through this joined-up service delivery model provided by Tusla with the close involvement of the various housing authorities nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  A housing authority can provide, on a humanitarian basis, short-term emergency housing to persons who are unable to return to their homes because of domestic violence without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s waiting list for housing supports.  <\/p>  <p>  Generally, where a victim is not seeking to return to the family home, a social housing assessment by the housing authority is the appropriate response.  Assessments should be conducted in a timely manner to ensure that victims do not end up residing in emergency accommodation, including refuge facilities, for long periods of time.  Once a customer has successfully completed a housing needs assessment, they can then apply for HAP.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this response, Tusla funds and supports over 40 organisations providing support services to victims of domestic violence, including 20 refuges providing safe specialist emergency domestic violence accommodation. Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services, and in particular, Domestic Violence refuges have been identified as one of Tusla&rsquo;s three highest priority services in its crisis management responses to the period of Covid-19 public health measures.  A range of supports have been put in place to assure continuity of essential services and there is ongoing systematic engagement between Tusla and service provider organisations around emerging needs.<\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of HAP, Rent Supplement continues to revert to original role of providing short-term support to those who have become temporarily unemployed and require income support to meet their tenancy cost whilst they seek alternative employment.  Rent supplement, by virtue of its short-term nature and its targeted customer cohort, is not considered the principal solution in meeting the accommodation needs of those fleeing domestic or sexual violence, in particular where, following a Housing Needs Assessment, HAP is an available option. <\/p>  <p>  There are no indications within my Department that the rent supplement scheme is operating in a way that is preventing victims of domestic violence from getting the support they need, and Community Welfare Officers are using the full flexibility of the scheme to assist those in need during the current crisis.<\/p>  <p>  As I have already indicated, I support the call for additional supports to be made available to victims of domestic violence during the current pandemic.  Officials from my Department are engaging with SAFE Ireland representatives to explore their proposal and discussions are on-going to ensure that appropriate supports are provided to victims of domestic violence to access short term emergency accommodation during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The provisions of Section 12 provide that an employee who has been temporarily laid-off or kept on short-time for four consecutive weeks, or for a series of six weeks within a thirteen week period of which not more than three are consecutive has an entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer.<\/p><p>As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work and there is a very real potential for these situations to become protracted. Under the existing provisions these lay-off and short-time situations could result in a large number of redundancies in a very short period of time. Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off after the periods of time currently provided for in Section 12.<\/p><p>In the current emergency situation the existing timelines set out in Section 12 of the Act would have serious unintended and detrimental financial impacts on businesses and employees over a short period of time. Significant numbers of redundancies over a short period of time would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover, which in turn would create many insolvency and bankruptcy situations. This will only exacerbate the risk of further job losses. Measures to assist the ongoing attachment between employees and their employer during the crisis is important.<\/p><p>For these reasons emergency legislation has been enacted by way of Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to mitigate against the risks to businesses outlined above and to protect for as long as possible the attachment to employment for employees. <\/p><p>The existing provisions of Section 12 have effectively been suspended during the emergency period, from 13<sup>th<\/sup>March 2020 to 31<sup>st<\/sup>May 2020, in respect of an employee who has been laid off or kept on short time due to the effects of measures required to be taken by the employer in order to comply with, or as a consequence of, Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of infection of Covid-19. The possibility of extending the end date of the emergency period is provided for in legislation and an extension is currently being considered. <\/p><p>In considering whether the end date will be extended, the Government will have regard to the principles which are set out in Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and in particular the need to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time resulting in permanent job losses.  The Government will also have regard to the Roadmap for re-opening Society and Business. <\/p><p>It is important to note that an employees&rsquo; right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay off or short-time work has not been removed, rather it has been deferred for a temporary period in this emergency situation.

A woman in this situation will then receive her full 26 week maternity benefit payment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection also provides income support for women who have lost their employment and are unable to return to work at the end of their maternity leave, in the form of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  Women concerned are eligible for this payment from the date when they were due to return to their employment after their maternity leave if they have lost their employment as a consequence of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Women on maternity leave should remain on that leave until such time as they are due to return to work.  A person can also avail of up to 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave which can be added to the end of the 26 week period of paid leave.<\/p>  <p>  Many employers can, and do, agree compassionate leave arrangements with staff who need to take short periods of time off to care for another person or new baby.  These include arrangements to enable employees to work remotely from home, to alter shift patterns around their partners work, to work-up time taken, to rearrange parental leave or to bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work periods.<\/p>  <p>  Where parents have to continue to work and is it not possible to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees can call on some statutory entitlements which provide for income support including paid Force Majeure Leave, Parent's Leave together with Parent's Benefit, for each parent where a baby was born after 1st November 2019 or unpaid Parental Leave. <\/p>  <p>  A decision to extend the period of maternity leave for employees would have to be implemented by the Minister for Justice and Equality who has policy and legal responsibility for this area.  In 2020 it is estimated that the Department will spend in excess of &euro;270 million on maternity benefit in respect of an average of 21,000 recipients per week.  Each additional week of maternity benefit, based on current recipient levels, would cost &euro;10.3m increasing to &euro;134 million for a 3 month period.  It should also be noted that there are additional significant costs to the Exchequer as these estimates do not include the costs of salary top-ups and substitution in the public sector.<\/p>  <p>  The weekly rate of the Covid-19 payment is &euro;350 and is aligned with the jobseeker payment for a person with an adult dependent.  The annual cost on increasing maternity benefit to &euro;350 would be an addition approx. &euro;115m.  Decisions around the extension of this benefit would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700159#WRGGG06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2614,"qnumday":917,"qnumall":"[7626\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she has considered strengthening Covid-19 emergency legislation in order that an employer will not be allowed to make an employee redundant during the emergency (details supplied).","asker":"1569","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2615,"content":"<p>Firstly, I would like to say that my thoughts are with all workers who are dealing with job losses or facing the prospect of redundancies at this difficult time.  I want to assure everybody that my Department is assisting affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months and will continue to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  An all-of-Government approach has been taken to financially support workers and businesses alike during the emergency period.  In addition to the existing range of social welfare support schemes, the Government has put in place the &lsquo;National COVID-19 Income Support Scheme&rsquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  This includes-<\/p>  <p>  - the temporary wage subsidy scheme to help affected companies keep paying their employees, maintain the employment relationship and keep businesses viable in order to prevent redundancies;<\/p>  <p>  - the emergency Pandemic Unemployment Payment for both employed and self-employed workers who have suffered a collapse in income.<\/p>  <p>  The emergency legislation which was enacted recently effectively suspends the provisions of Section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended) which relate to the rights of an employee to claim a redundancy entitlement from their employer after temporary periods of lay-off and short-time work during the Covid-19 emergency period.  This was done to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time, which would only exacerbate the risk of further permanent job losses and redundancies.<\/p>  <p>  In implementing all of the above the Government has already put in place significant measures which are helping to prevent redundancies.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal to withdraw an employer&rsquo;s right to make workers redundant could have far reaching and significant unintended consequences, including interfering with individual contracts of employment.  Furthermore it cannot be said that all employees will want the redundancy provision removed as is suggested.  Employees may have significant service with an employer, and as significant stakeholders in a business be aware that the business is struggling and redundancy may be the better option for some of them.  Restricting their right to access a redundancy payment and seek new work opportunities or reskilling opportunities is a very real issue for them. <\/p>  <p>  The proposal could also create a risk to an employee's right to a redundancy payment.  The State does not have the power to stop a business closing or to prevent liquidations once the provisions of company law are complied with.  Unfortunately the closure of the business will happen in some circumstances and this is a very real concern fir many business right now, including many small businesses endeavouring to stay in business.  If the right of the employer to make an employee redundant is taken away this could jeopardise an employee&rsquo;s right to compensation by way of a redundancy payment while the liquidation of that company is underway.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to bear in mind why redundancy provisions are used.  If a business is in trading and in financial difficulties very often one of the mechanisms used to save that business (which in turn saves some jobs) is redundancy.  An employer may downsize their business and reduce their workforce by way of redundancies in order to continue to be viable.  If the right of the employer to make employees redundant is removed it could result in more permanent job losses.  <\/p>  <p>  Employers have to make decisions on the ongoing viability of their firms in real time and having regard to real circumstances &ndash; particularly in  circumstances where revenues have collapsed for many firms.   Directors of firms have, under company law provisions, very serious and personal responsibilities to ensure that they can continue to trade and not trade whilst insolvent.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally and this is important for employees who may be in a position to negotiate a redundancy package with the many genuine employers in our economy - if a company is restricted from making employees redundant and has to retain them on payroll, the assets of that company will dissipate and mean that any negotiated redundancy package has less chance of success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":2616,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2617,"qnumday":918,"qnumall":"[7652\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if Covid-19 payments will be extended to specific industries in relation to the timeframe in which they are permitted to return to work, that is, the live events industry which was the first to close down and will be the last to reopen; if it will be ensured that if the Covid-19 payments become industry specific that the event industry is given recognition for being one of the last industries to return to work in view of the fact it is vital to ensure skill retention in the industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":2618,"qnumday":935,"qnumall":"[7333\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will extend the pandemic unemployment payment; and if so, the length of time the payment will be extended for and the rates for same.","asker":"1615","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":2619,"qnumday":942,"qnumall":"[7382\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the date the pandemic unemployment payment is due to cease in June 2020; her plans to extend the payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":2620,"qnumday":949,"qnumall":"[7482\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to modify the short-term work support scheme during the reopening phase; her further plans to increase the rate of the scheme in line with the pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350; her plans to tailor the scheme in line with the need of specific sectors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":2621,"qnumday":971,"qnumall":"[7759\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to extend the pandemic unemployment payment until August 2020 for persons that are not due to return to work until phase 5 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.","asker":"1555","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2622,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 918, 935, 942, 949 and 971 together.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 unemployment payment was introduced as a time limited emergency measure to meet the surge in unemployment which resulted from the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic and the final payment is due to be made on 9th June 2020. <\/p>  <p>  As we gradually move through the phases of reopening our society, we need to now review the nature of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and how it fits into cross-Government plans to keep Ireland healthy and get the country working again.

As deputies are well aware, with the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the economic turmoil caused by Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it is regrettable that the Debenhams workers now face redundancy.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.  Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to income supports, the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was available to the employees when they were initially temporarily laid off and continues to be paid to them while the emergency payment is in operation.  In some cases, where it was more advantageous, employees will have been awarded a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance payment depending on their family composition and circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the immediate income supports the Dublin Mid Leinster Division of my Department organised and hosted an online information session on 15\/5\/2020 for Debenhams employees.  The purpose of this online session was to give support to the employees during this difficult time and to provide reassurance that there is a variety of organisations and services available to them to with the ultimate aim of supporting them back to employment.  The supports and advice outlined included initial income supports, job searching, training\/education options, help with CVs and\/or interview preparation as well as advice on self-employment and personal finances.<\/p>  <p>  Information was presented by representatives of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Education and Training Boards, Jobs Clubs, the Local Enterprise Office and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.<\/p>  <p>  An invitation to the online information session was facilitated to employees through the Mandate Trade Union and Debenhams.  Approximately 230 employees viewed the information session.  Follow up information and contact details are currently being issued to any employees seeking further information or support on the options outlined. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to redundancy supports, entitlement to a redundancy payment is defined under the Redundancy Payments Act.  It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments to eligible employees.  In situations where an employer is unable to pay these entitlements due to financial difficulties or insolvency an application for payment under the Redundancy Payments Scheme may be submitted to the Department.  The Department is engaging with the liquidator with a view to progressing these redundancy applications.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":2658,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH04800"},{"type":"question","counter":2659,"qnumday":934,"qnumall":"[7269\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700160#WRHHH04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps she is taking to provide supports for those returning here from working abroad due to the Covid-19 pandemic due to the fact that they may have lost their job abroad or need to take care of sick relatives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2660,"content":"<p>The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been introduced as an emergency measure so that payments can be made as quickly as possible to the large number of people in the state who have become fully unemployed due to the pandemic.

As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work and there is a very real potential for these situations to become protracted. Under the existing provisions these lay-off and short-time situations could result in a large number of redundancies in a very short period of time. Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off after the periods of time currently provided for in Section 12.<\/p>  <p>  In the current emergency situation the existing timelines set out in Section 12 of the Act would have serious unintended and detrimental financial impacts on businesses and employees over a short period of time. Significant numbers of redundancies over a short period of time would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover, which in turn would create many insolvency and bankruptcy situations. This will only exacerbate the risk of further job losses. Measures to assist the ongoing attachment between employees and their employer during the crisis is important.<\/p>  <p>   For these reasons emergency legislation has been enacted by way of Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to mitigate against the risks to businesses outlined above and to protect for as long as possible the attachment to employment for employees. <\/p>  <p>   The existing provisions of Section 12 have effectively been suspended during the emergency period, from 13th March 2020 to 31st May 2020, in respect of an employee who has been laid off or kept on short time due to the effects of measures required to be taken by the employer in order to comply with, or as a consequence of, Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of infection of Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>   The extension of the end date of the emergency period is provided for in legislation and an extension is currently being considered.   In considering whether the end date will be extended, the Government will have regard to the principles which are set out in Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and in particular the need to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time resulting in permanent job losses.  The government will also have regard to the timelines set out in the Roadmap to re-open Society and Business.<\/p>  <p>   It is important to note that an employees&rsquo; right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay off or short-time work has not been removed, rather it has been deferred for a temporary period in this emergency situation. <\/p>  <p>   There are no specific guidelines in relation to exiting temporary lay-off situations, however employers are expected to keep up to date contact details of their employees in order to advise them of their date of return to work or the continuation of the lay-off.

This payment is payable to people of working age between 18 and up to 66 which is is consistent with other Social Protection income supports paid to working age persons. <\/p>  <p>  The primary State income support in respect of people who are aged 66 years or over is the State Pension &ndash; either the contributory State pension or the means-tested non-contributory pension.  People over 66 years do not pay social insurance contributions and can retain all of their State Contributory Pension if they lose employment, thus guaranteeing an income support.  People in receipt of a reduced rate of non-contributory pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their State pension payment increased if they lose that employment income or if it is reduced.  Recipients of State pension payments may, if they satisfy the eligibility conditions, have access to a range of supports not available to unemployed people aged under 66.

My Department is advancing a number of significant recruitment initiatives to meet the critical staffing needs of employers who are delivering essential services to our communities.  The Employer Relations Team has responded to the need to fill critical vacancies by adapting their recruitment processes to provide tailored responses to deal with the unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-19.  These initiatives have been advanced in collaboration with State funded training agencies and employer representative organisations.<\/p>  <p>  In the healthcare sector, my Department, in collaboration with Skillnet Ireland and Nursing Homes Ireland, matched 50 qualified healthcare assistants to individual nursing homes.  A further 187 people availed of online training via the Healthcare Assistant Induction Programme (HAIP).  This training programme is a new employment response to give participants a thorough grounding in the basics of healthcare.  It is delivered online over three weeks, via interactive virtual classrooms funded by Skillnet Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has worked with more than 40 employers in the horticulture sector, particularly those engaged as fruit producers, and has made over 2,400 referrals.  This is in addition to jobseekers who have contacted these employers directly as a result of the online Help2Harvest campaign.<\/p>  <p>  Further Education and Training (FET) plays a critical role in the labour market activation response and in upskilling and reskilling those who have been displaced as a result of economic downturn.  Building and sustaining skills in the labour force will require a key focus as the labour market recovers, with a particular emphasis on skills which will be in demand.  <\/p>  <p>  SOLAS are working in partnership with officials in my Department to develop an agile response which brings together and builds on existing FET expertise and resources to provide the recently unemployed cohort with the &lsquo;Skills to Compete&rsquo; in the labour market.  The aim is to maximise an individual&rsquo;s potential for re-entry to sustainable work by developing skills, building digital capabilities and providing specific courses targeting growth sectors and occupations, and linking this to advice and supports tailored to the individual.  This initiative complements other resources and structures, such as the Regional Skills Fora, to effectively match individuals and prospective employers.  Using local labour market intelligence, responses can be adapted to meet regional needs and challenges.<\/p>  <p>  I have also established a Labour Market Advisory Council (LMAC) which comprises an independent group of industry leaders and labour market experts, having been originally established as the Labour Market Council in 2013.  The Advisory Council will provide advice to Government to support labour market and business recovery and  is currently developing proposals outlining the required public policy responses that will assist the retraining and re-employment of those who have been disrupted by the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700161#WRJJJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":2719,"qnumday":955,"qnumall":"[7574\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700161#WRJJJ05500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the obligation of employers regarding the selection of staff for lay-offs during the Covid-19 lockdown with particular reference to obligations to inform staff of the methods used.","asker":"1569","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2720,"content":"<p>Dismissal in circumstances where a genuine redundancy situation exists is regarded as one of the fair reasons for dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2015.

As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work and there is a very real potential for these situations to become protracted. Under the existing provisions these lay-off and short-time situations could result in a large number of redundancies in a very short period of time.

Significant numbers of redundancies over a short period of time would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover, which in turn would create many insolvency and bankruptcy situations. This will only exacerbate the risk of further job losses. Measures to assist the ongoing attachment between employees and their employer during the crisis is important.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons emergency legislation has been enacted by way of Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to mitigate against the risks to businesses outlined above and to protect for as long as possible the attachment to employment for employees. <\/p>  <p>The existing provisions of Section 12 have effectively been suspended during the emergency period, from 13th March 2020 to 31st May 2020, in respect of an employee who has been laid off or kept on short time due to the effects of measures required to be taken by the employer in order to comply with, or as a consequence of, Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of infection of Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  Extending the end date of the emergency period is provided for in legislation and an extension is currently being considered.  In considering whether the end date will be extended, the Government will have regard to the principles which are set out in Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and in particular the need to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time resulting in permanent job losses.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that an employees&rsquo; right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay off or short-time work has not been removed, rather it has been deferred for a temporary period in this emergency situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700161#WRJJJ05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance","counter":2725,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700162#WRKKK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2726,"qnumday":957,"qnumall":"[7599\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700162#WRKKK00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on a domiciliary care allowance appeal by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2727,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received from the person concerned on the 4th September 2019.

As deputies are well aware, with the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the economic turmoil caused by Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it is regrettable that the Debenhams workers now face redundancy.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.  Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department. <\/p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.<\/p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the liquidation of Debenhams there have been calls on the Government to intervene in or halt the liquidation of the company and to ensure that employees of Debenhams receive enhanced redundancy payments.  Employee representatives have also called for the 30 day mandatory consultation period to be extended.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been clear that she, as the Minister responsible for company law legislation, has no statutory power to intervene in a court supervised liquidation.  A company is permitted to initiate a voluntary winding up where it has complied with requirements of the Companies Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I have been asked by the Mandate Trade Union to utilise my powers in accordance with Section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  In this regard, I sought urgent legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to those powers as they pertain to a court appointed liquidator.  I received those advices yesterday and they are unequivocal. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that I, as Minister, cannot exercise the powers in section 15 because those powers envisage engagement only with the employer.  As is clear from the statutory definition, a liquidator is not an employer for the purposes of this Act.  Therefore, there is no possibility of using the section 15 mechanism as suggested. <\/p>  <p>  While we don&rsquo;t have the power to ensure that Debenhams pay an enhanced redundancy package to its employees, an employer is obliged to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement as provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and that is all that can be legally enforced against an employer.  <\/p>  <p>  As the company has been declared insolvent, the Department can provide a safety net for employees and the liquidator can submit claims for statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  We will ensure that the statutory redundancy entitlement which is laid out in legislation will be paid.<\/p>  <p>  My officials inform me that the notification and consultation requirements of that Act, as they are construed, have also been complied with.<\/p>  <p>  The employee representatives are aware that there are other avenues of recourse outside seeking ministerial intervention and I hope they consider their options in that regard.  <\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, 2003 offers significant protection to fixed term workers and the purpose of this legislation is:<\/p>  <p>  1. to ensure that fixed term workers are afforded no less favourable treatment than their comparable permanent counterparts and   <\/p>  <p>  2. to prevent employers from abusing employees by employing them on a series of successive short fixed term contracts, rather than offering them a permanent one. <\/p>  <p>  An employee who has worked continuously for at least 104 weeks under a fixed-term or specified purpose contract may qualify for a redundancy payment when the contract ends.  In order for any permanent employee to qualify for redundancy they also require the same service so there is no distinction under the Fixed Term Work Act.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700164#WRMMM03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":2863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700164#WRMMM04000"},{"type":"question","counter":2864,"qnumday":1011,"qnumall":"[8128\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700164#WRMMM04100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to amend the law suspending the right of workers to claim redundancy payments to exclude from the law workers whose employers have had a liquidator appointed by the High Court and that are therefore closed permanently; if so, when is it planned to amend same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2865,"content":"<p>I understand this question to be related to the recent emergency legislation which was enacted by way of Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.

Section 19 of those Acts provides that in setting a rent under a tenancy of a dwelling, the rental amount shall not exceed market rent. In a Rent Pressure Zone, a rent increase restriction of 4% per annum applies. <\/p><p>With effect from 27 March 2020, new emergency measures were introduced into law to protect tenants during the COVID-19 emergency period. Rent increases are prohibited and tenants cannot be forced to leave their rental accommodation, other than in exceptional circumstances, during the COVID-19 emergency period. Initially, these emergency laws will last for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector<\/i>recognised that rental inflation is the most significant challenge to security of tenure in the rental sector. To address this, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to moderate the rate of rent increases in those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising quickly. Currently, almost 73% of approximately 364,000 tenancies in the private rental sector are covered by RPZ designations and benefit from the rent increase restriction of 4% p.a. <\/p><p>In order to support more robust enforcement of the RPZ regime, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provided the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with additional powers and resources to carry out investigations and sanction landlords, if required, for any contravention of the 4% rent increase restriction in RPZs.<\/p><p>Ultimately, the most effective way to make rents more affordable in the medium to long term is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rental sectors. The Government is tackling housing affordability in a number of ways to help ensure that people can provide themselves with a home - whether for rent or purchase.  <\/p><p>Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other major urban centres are facing significant housing access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the establishment of a cost rental sector in Ireland. Cost rental is housing where rents only cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes. Cost rental lacks the profit margin involved in the private rental sector and rents are not set by the market according to supply and demand. Cost Rental represents a new form of rental tenure for Ireland and a new State intervention into the rental market.<\/p><p>A working group on cost rental involving my Department, the Land Development Agency (LDA), the Housing Agency, and other stakeholders, is developing the policy framework for a broad cost rental model and examining how a sustainable financing structure can be established to deliver cost rental units at the necessary scale. Detailed operational and eligibility criteria for cost rental will be informed by this evidence building and policy work. The Group's work will also be assisted by support, including in relation to research, which is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on the Group's behalf. The EIB has extensive international experience in affordable housing and is providing technical assistance in assessing the potential market for cost rental in Ireland. <\/p><p>Cost rental work is also being supported by two pilot projects, at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore and at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown. The latter of these has already commenced construction, supported by EIB funding, and the first homes are anticipated to come on stream from 2021. Additionally, the LDA and some local authorities are actively considering cost rental as an option for sites within their land portfolios.  An example of this can be seen in the planning application which has been submitted for lands at Shanganagh in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, where the LDA is working in partnership with the County Council to deliver over 350 cost rental homes.<\/p><p>The selection of further sites for cost rental consideration will be informed by emerging policy and by the financial and operational model that will develop from the evidence building that is currently underway.<\/p><p>The Government has also introduced a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, introduced with effect from 1 February 2018, enables credit-worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Help To Buy (HTB) incentive, announced in Budget 2017 and set to run until the end of 2021, is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. The incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (D.I.R.T.) paid over the previous 4 tax years, limited to a maximum of 5% of the purchase value. The HTB refund is capped at &euro;20,000. As of 30 April  2020, a total of 18,854 HTB claims have been made, of which 18,207 are approved. The estimated total value of approved HTB claims to date is in the order of &euro;271.4 million. <\/p><p>Increasing the supply of new homes at affordable prices is a key pillar of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan. Under Rebuilding Ireland, the Government introduced the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). The objective of the LIHAF is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve infrastructure blockages, thereby enabling the accelerated delivery of housing in Dublin and in other urban areas in high demand. Funding of &euro;200m has been allocated across 30 projects over the period to 2021 and work is underway to deliver the infrastructure with an associated housing delivery of up to 20,000 units. About 40% of these homes will be sold at rates which provide a discount on market prices. More than 3,000 will be social housing homes and the remainder will be sold at market rates. <\/p><p>In addition, &euro;310m is also available under the Serviced Sites Fund over the period to 2021 for infrastructure works on local authority lands that will support the delivery of housing for rent or purchase at rates which provide a significant discount on open market costs. Two calls for proposals have been made to date, which have resulted in &lsquo;Approval in Principle&rsquo; being given for an allocation of c. &euro;127m in funding for 35 projects, which will deliver some 3,200 more affordable homes. It is anticipated that a further call for proposals will issue in 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700166#WROOO02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1554"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Development Agency","counter":2925,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700166#WROOO02500"},{"type":"question","counter":2926,"qnumday":1033,"qnumall":"[7177\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700166#WROOO02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if all staff appointments and all contracts for services by the Land Development Agency have been publicly advertised and fully comply with all relevant public sector recruitment and procurement rules and guidelines; if there have been exemptions granted from such rules and guidelines; if so, when; and the reason such exemptions were granted.","asker":"1468","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":2927,"content":"<p>The Land Development Agency was established on an interim basis in September 2018, by way of an Establishment Order made under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies Act) 1971, pending the enactment of primary legislation when it will be established as a commercial State agency. <\/p>  <p>  The day to day management of the LDA is matter for the Chief Executive and his management team reporting to the LDA Interim Board. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the Establishment Order, I, as Minister appointed the Chief Executive Officer following an open recruitment process.

In reviewing rent limits, the Department worked closely with the DEASP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre. The new rent limits set in the Regulations involved reflected significant increases on previous limits, in the order of 60% in some areas.<\/p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of, homelessness. The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households faces in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.<\/p><p>At end 2019, 42.7% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility. When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin region is removed, 36.0% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 16.6% above rent limits provided. This increases to 22.5% when the Dublin region homeless area data is included.  Wicklow County Council used discretion in 28.3% of HAP tenancies and the average level of discretion applied by Wicklow County Council was 16.5%.<\/p><p>HAP rent limits are kept under constant review, as is the use of discretion by local authorities, and the data indicates that there is no need to increase the rent limits at this time. I am also conscious that any such increase could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.

This forms a core objective of the Government's investment in rural water supplies and forms part of the review of rural water services that is currently underway.  Sustained investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public and private water sector is essential.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 July 2018, the European Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice to Ireland citing 73 public drinking water supplies and 24 private group water schemes each with elevated concentrations of a group of disinfection by-product chemicals called trihalomethanes (THMs). These chemicals are formed during disinfection when raw waters have high levels of natural organic material.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s response to the Letter of Formal Notice on 19 October 2018 highlighted plans for investment to resolve this issue in each supply by upgrading and improving treatment processes and outlined the significant progress that had already been made in addressing excess THM formation in both public and private water supplies. This was followed up by a further progress report to the Commission in May 2019.  On 14 May 2020, the Commission escalated the infringement and issued a &lsquo;Reasoned Opinion&rsquo; to Ireland regarding a failure to fulfil obligations under Articles 4 of Directive 98\/83\/EC on drinking water.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Letter of Formal Notice had raised the issue of informing, advising and notifying consumers under Article 8(3) and (7) of the Drinking Water Directive.

The most recent update relates to Q1 2020, and shows that of the 31 public water supply zones named in the Reasoned Opinion, a further 13 are now compliant with the THM parameters.

While the Act would allow me to prescribe such a register admission examination as a route to registration for eligible persons, neither I nor my Department have the remit or the competence to validate or approve the proposed register admission examination. Assessment for registration under section 14(2)(f) comes within the responsibility of the RIAI, who are designated as the registration body for the purposes of the 2007 Act, and as the competent authority for the purposes of the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications (as amended).

This is distinctly different from the &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; policy in other countries. The Report also states &ldquo;The key to life safety in all apartment buildings is a proper two-stage fire detection and alarm system, together with an evacuation strategy&hellip;&rdquo;.<\/p><p>In regard to the recent changes to the Building Regulations technical guidance document for fire safety, Part B and Technical Guidance Document (TGD) B of the Building Regulations deal with fire safety issues.  Part B of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations sets the legal performance requirements of buildings and the associated TGD B provides guidance on how to achieve that performance for common building types.  Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance in TGD B, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B. <\/p><p>The design of apartments in Ireland has been evolving over recent years, as design teams learn from best practice around the world. In particular, open plan apartments are becoming increasingly popular. TGD B 2006 did not provide specific guidance on open plan apartment arrangements. In 2018, following liaison with Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), a working group of experts from DFB and my Department was set up to examine the issue of open plan apartments in Ireland and develop appropriate guidance.<\/p><p>All proposed changes to the Building Regulations or amendments to TGDs are formally notified to the European Commission and are subject to a public consultation process and a Regulatory Impact Analysis. The recent additional guidance to TGD B 2006 is no different, in that a draft was published for public consultation from 23 June 2019 to 23 August 2019. <\/p><p>A significant number of submissions were received from individuals, fire safety consultants, housing providers, other organisations and local authorities. My Department carefully evaluated all 39 submissions received, which included approximately 400 comments.  In addition, a number of meetings took place with stakeholders such as local authority fire officers, fire safety consultants and construction industry stakeholders.  <\/p><p>In developing the additional guidance, standards, tests and engineering approaches were considered and fire safety requirements in a number of jurisdictions, including England, Scotland, the USA, Australia, Denmark and Hong Kong, were reviewed.  <\/p><p>The additional guidance amending TGD B 2006 published in February 2020 has a number of provisions for buildings containing apartments and includes a new section specifying provisions for open plan apartments.  In relation to internal layouts and provisions for open plan apartments with travel distances exceeding 9m, the guidance provides for -<\/p><p>- sprinkler protection within the apartment to control fire development; <\/p><p>- maximum travel distances within the apartment of 20m; <\/p><p>- single storey apartments only;<\/p><p>- an enhanced fire detection and alarm systems within the apartment;<\/p><p>- interconnected alarms in circulation areas, bedrooms and high risk areas to ensure early detection and warning of a fire; and <\/p><p>- enclosed kitchens or a distance of 1.8m from the main kitchen cooking appliances to the escape route, which is in line with international research and testing. <\/p><p>For smaller apartments, with travel distances less than or equal to 9m, the guidance in TGD B has not changed. TGD B has referenced BS 5588 Part 1: 1990 since the introduction of Building Regulations in 1991, and this continues to be applicable. In these apartments, the travel distances from the apartment entrance door to any point in any habitable room cannot exceed 9m, no habitable room can be an inner room, and the position of any cooking facilities should be remote from the dwelling entrance door and not prejudice the escape route from any point in the apartment. This typically applies to small studio type flats with open internal layouts. <\/p><p>The additional guidance provides that an escape route from a bedroom cannot be through a kitchen in a non-sprinklered apartment, as no habitable room can be an inner room in accordance with BS 5588 Part 1: 1990, as currently referenced in TGD B. Furthermore, the existing provisions of BS 5588-1:1990 clearly indicate that escape from flats with a floor more than 4.5m above ground level should be via common protected corridors\/lobbies and protected stairways, not via escape windows. While this does not consider windows to be suitable for escape, it does not preclude the use of windows for rescue. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the additional guidance also addresses other aspects of fire safety for buildings containing apartments and this is set out at the beginning of reprint TGD B 2020.  All of the guidance in TGD B (Reprint 2020) should be considered collectively, as fire safety must be addressed in a holistic manner, considering building resilience and ensuring a building is safe for occupant egress and firefighter operations simultaneously.<\/p><p>Technical Guidance Document B - Fire Safety (2006) (Reprint 2020) and a Background Note on Recent Changes to Part B and TGD B of the Building Regulations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<\/p><p>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Accommodation Scheme","counter":3015,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":3016,"qnumday":1067,"qnumall":"[7849\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the operational guidelines that exist for local authorities in respect of their administration of the rental accommodation scheme; the specific rules that local authorities must abide by in terms of the date that the scheme is payable by them, that is, from the date of application or the date of award; if the latter, the reason for this; and the rules or guidelines in place if there is a significant processing delay by the local authority.","asker":"1550","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3017,"content":"<p>Local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on the households needs in their respective areas.

One of the key criteria to achieve designation under the above process was that where works were proposed, the Contractor employed by the local authority or the Approved Housing Body was required to confirm that they could undertake the works in accordance with HSE and Government COVID-19-related public health guidelines and recommendations. Another criteria was that these projects were, for the most part, practically complete, with minor final snagging, landscaping, paving and external works to be completed. <\/p>  <p>  The activation of these sites gave both the construction site teams and the contracting body- either the local authority or Approved Housing Body- an opportunity to practically implement some of the concepts that were being prepared across the board by the Sector working with Government on standard operating procedures and to feedback to their representative organisation. It also allowed for a level of readiness to commence other activity on non-essential sites.  While the earlier activation might also provide some slightly earlier indication of the additional costs arising,  the real impact on programmes, costs and productivity will vary from site to site and the stage of development (commencement or near completion). <\/p>  <p>  This view has been underscored in recent correspondence which I have received from Property Industry Ireland (PII), which indicates that it will be some time before such an exercise is possible, and noting that the sector is very conscious of the impact of any increase in costs on its competitiveness and so there is an incentive for the sector to examine ways in which to minimise or reduce costs.  <\/p>  <p>  The Construction Sector Group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector in the context of the delivery of the National Development Plan, will provide a useful forum for the engagement on the wider industry impacts of COVID-19 arrangements.  This Group&rsquo;s remit includes working with industry and government bodies to benchmark and improve productivity and environmental sustainability and to modernise public works delivery. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has sought to support the current measures by encouraging planning authorities, where possible, to adopt a discretionary approach in relation to construction working hours conditions attached to planning permissions so as to assist the splitting of shifts for separating trades and activities required to achieve physical distancing on construction sites in accordance with relevant public health\/ health and safety advice and protocols, while seeking to balance this with the need to ensure output and productivity by the sector. <\/p>  <p>  Within this broader frame, my Department will monitor any specific viability issues arising for the housing sector.  This is an area which my Department has actively considered in recent years and measures have been brought forward such as the standardisation of documentation and innovative production methods for social housing programmes and statutory planning guidance on building heights and apartments to improve viability by lowering costs, while ensuring a quality urban environment.  My Department will also continue to participate in Construction Sector Group discussions on wider industry issues, including productivity and innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1554"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":3025,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":3026,"qnumday":1071,"qnumall":"[8018\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ01600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the extent to which Rebuilding Ireland home loans are available now and in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1554"},{"type":"question","counter":3027,"qnumday":1072,"qnumall":"[8019\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of persons who have made an application for Rebuilding Ireland home loans; the number granted, refused and pending, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1554"},{"type":"speech","counter":3028,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1071 and 1072 together.<\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL) was launched on 1 February 2018.

Approved borrowing sanctions, as indicated above, have been for housing projects in such existing towns and villages in County Clare. My Department&rsquo;s Serviced Sites Fund, supporting the development of publically owned sites for affordable housing development, similarly concentrates on established city and town areas where such existing local services and infrastructure are currently available.  <\/p>  <p>  The Meelick site is situated within a small residential area that is isolated from such necessary local services and has severely limited public transport.

Furthermore, the local authority's Core Strategy Population Target for Ballycannon North (Meelick) indicates a target increase in population of 124 Persons (45 Households) only, from 2011-2023.  It is not clear whether or not the current population may have already reached this target.

The Declaration allowed for the shooting of wood pigeon to prevent serious damage to arable crops except for the months of June, July and August this year.  As in previous years the renewal of the Declaration was the subject of consultation with relevant stakeholders such as hunting, conservation and farming bodies as well as the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  <\/p><p>I made the decision at the time taking account of scientific advice provided as part of the consultation. This raised concerns about the full year inclusion in the Declaration of wood pigeon on the basis that there is limited evidence to suggest that wood pigeon cause &ldquo;serious damage&rdquo; to crops during the summer. It was submitted that there is a lack of comprehensive studies into wood pigeon damage to crops to inform the decision to allow for year-round derogations for their control. Studies of wood pigeon food preference in Ireland from 2013 have shown that in spring, the diet of wood pigeons is dominated by fruit and seeds of trees (Ivy). In summer, the diet is variable and consists of a relatively equal proportion of cereal grains, clover and weed material.  <\/p><p>This 2013 study further highlighted that cereal crops were only the preferred food during the autumn months (defined as August&ndash;October in the study). Based on current cropping systems, these crops were most likely consumed post-harvest i.e., harvest spillage left on stubble fields.  While the derogation is given to &lsquo;prevent serious damage to crops&rsquo; there is limited evidence to suggest &lsquo;serious damage&rsquo; to crops occurs during the summer period.  It was also indicated that shooting of wood pigeon during summer months could have indirect adverse effects on other species such as stock dove and it was recommended that there is a need to <i>&ldquo;undertake a contemporary review of the species interaction with crops with respect to damage<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Pending such a review, and on the basis of available literature and the &ldquo;precautionary principle&rdquo;, I considered it appropriate at the time that the wood pigeon would be removed from the Declaration for the summer months &ndash; June, July and August 2020. <\/p><p>At the same time, I recognised that if wood pigeons were seen to cause damage to crops during the summer, landowners could still avail of Section 42 permits under the Wildlife Acts i.e., permits, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual species on specific lands. <\/p><p>Since the Declaration was signed last month I have considered the matter further in consultation with farming sector interests who raised concerns about the exclusion of the wood pigeon from the Declaration during the June to August period on the basis of damage to crop yield, damage to crops making them difficult to harvest and also faecal contamination. <\/p><p>In the circumstances and in light of potential damage highlighted by farming sector interests, I  took the view that consideration of changing the status quo by removing the wood pigeon from the Declaration during this year&rsquo;s summer could benefit from further information and studies.  <\/p><p>Accordingly, I have decided that the status quo be reinstated for the wood pigeon this year i.e., that lethal means would be available to landowners during the three summer months June, July and August to prevent crop damage. I have signed a revised Declaration to this effect. Additionally, the issue of wood pigeon damage to crops during the summer months will be examined with a view to considering this issue in the 2021\/22 year. A reply will issue to all correspondence received in my office on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3075,"content":"<p>Question No. 1084 answered with Question No. 1081.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3076,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 1085 and 1086 answered with Question No. 1083.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gorse Burning","counter":3078,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700169#WRRRR00300"},{"type":"question","counter":3079,"qnumday":1087,"qnumall":"[7356\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700169#WRRRR00400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will consider reviewing the existing penalties for those prosecuted for illegal gorse fires in view of the contention of many heritage and wildlife groups that the existing measures do not act as a sufficient deterrent.","asker":"1626","askee":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":3080,"qnumday":1088,"qnumall":"[7358\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700169#WRRRR00500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of persons prosecuted for illegally starting gorse fires in 2018 and 2019, by county.","asker":"1626","askee":"1472"},{"type":"speech","counter":3081,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1087 and 1088 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has taken some 8 prosecutions under the Wildlife Acts since 2010 for illegal burning of vegetation in counties Clare, Cork and Kerry.

Financial support to private sector infrastructure projects are subject to European State Aid rules.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a location for production  - both inward and indigenous - continues to grow. The Government highly values the cultural, creative and economic potential of Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual industry, as reflected in the incorporation of &euro;200m to be invested in the industry through Screen Ireland over the 10 years to 2027 and the Audiovisual Action Plan.  Government support for the sector is also provided through the section 481 tax credit and training and skills development initiatives as part of that process have contributed to growing Ireland&rsquo;s skilled audiovisual workforce, making Ireland an attractive destination for film-making. This has given rise to an increased demand for film studio space across the country. Expansions of high quality studio space have already taken place in areas such as Troy Studios in Limerick and a number of major international projects have chosen to film on location in Ireland. While the current COVID-19 crisis has lead to the temporary cessation of live action productions, it is hoped that the easing of restrictions in the coming weeks and months will allow the resumption of work already in the pipeline. In addition, in response to the lack of production activity at this time, measures introduced by Screen Ireland to support the industry are designed to aid production companies and creative talent in developing a strong slate of quality projects, so that the industry can emerge from the current situation in a position to scale up production activity in studios across the country and respond to the global rise in demand for audiovisual content. I look forward to the development of this proposed media park in Dublin and the contribution it will make to growing the audiovisual sector in Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700169#WRRRR01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Control","counter":3089,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700169#WRRRR01450"},{"type":"question","counter":3090,"qnumday":1092,"qnumall":"[7380\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052700169#WRRRR01475","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide the details including briefing notes of the briefing provided to her by her Department in respect of the derogation declarations for 2020 and 2021, that is, for the period 1 May 2020 to 30 April 2021 with regard to the customary annual derogations declarations that cater for the control of certain wild bird species in the interests of public health and safety and to protect air safety.
