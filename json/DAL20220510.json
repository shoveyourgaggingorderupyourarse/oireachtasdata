That is a very unfair characterisation of very genuine concerns that are grounded in decades of women&rsquo;s experiences of healthcare in this State.  The Taoiseach's dismissal of these concerns is particularly disappointing given that his comments pre-empt Oireachtas examination of the Government&rsquo;s proposal.  The process and debate to take place this week at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and in the D&aacute;il are undermined when the head of Government brushes aside the central questions before the scrutiny even begins.  Why bother allowing for the scrutiny of the proposals at all if the Taoiseach presents the current deal as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>and says the Government will be &quot;pressing ahead&quot; with the plan regardless of the outcome of Oireachtas deliberations?  That is the wrong way to deal with this issue.<\/p><p>The Government proposes to invest between &euro;800 million and &euro;1 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money in building a new and much-needed national maternity hospital.  It simply makes sense that the land on which that hospital is to be built is owned by the State.  This means a very clean transaction whereby the land is transferred directly to the State.  That was the original plan so why do we get this convoluted, messy ownership structure instead?  The answer to that question is all about the financial power of the land.  It is about the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group retaining control of the land so it can use its value as leverage for future financial transactions.  It is about the private interests of this group trumping the public good and a Government that is willing to let this happen.  The Taoiseach can talk all day about the land costing only a tenner a year but what he does not say is that the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group retains the right to impose a rent of &euro;850,000 a year if a dispute about the operation of the hospital arises in the future.  This gives the private landlord significant leverage and control and it most certainly does not amount to public ownership, as the Taoiseach has claimed.<\/p><p>Genuine concerns have also been expressed about the lack of clarity regarding the definition of &quot;clinical appropriateness&quot; in the legal documents.  While the Minister says he has legal guarantees, it will be judges and not politicians who will adjudicate on any potential dispute and any legal interpretation.<\/p> <p>For this and other reasons, the ownership of the site is not a red herring.  Everybody wants this new hospital and we want it built quickly, but we need to get it right.<\/p> <p> Is &eacute; an rud is ciallmhaire n&aacute; go dt&oacute;gfar an t-ospid&eacute;al m&aacute;ithreachais nua ar thalamh poibl&iacute;.

What we need is a public maternity hospital built on public land, and this can still be done.  Will the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health now get around a table with St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and convince it to transfer the land directly to the State, as was the original plan and the original commitment from the Sisters of Charity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652187900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The one thing that undermines public debate on this issue is honesty of approach.  I genuinely say we need honesty and we need a full focus on the facts.  We should not play politics with this because it is too important.  It is too important for women's health and for premature babies who will be born into the future and need a first-class neonatal facility.  That is what the new hospital will do.  It will go from 35 neonatal beds to 50 and there will not be the same confinement that we have in the current hospital.  The current hospital is not fit for purpose.  Since 2013, this has been mooted.  We are now in 2022, nearly nine years later, and Deputy McDonald wants to delay it another few years and does not seem to want to get what is a modern maternity hospital built.  It will take some years yet to get it built once we get sanction.<\/p>  <p>  Honesty is important in the debate.

The ownership is not an issue here.  If Deputy McDonald does not listen to me, that is fine, but listen to the senior midwives at the hospital, who have asked all politicians, Government and Opposition, to listen to the clinicians in the hospital.  I have the letter here from the senior midwives of the National Maternity Hospital, who are very clear that future service users require and deserve state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities, and who state: &ldquo;We urge all political parties in Government and Opposition to listen to the clinical staff delivering the service and to approve this project without further delay&rdquo;.  It was signed by Mary Brosnan, the director of midwifery and nursing, and quite a number more, including other assistant directors of midwifery and nursing.

What other business has the HSE if it is not going to build a maternity hospital here or facilitate the construction of a maternity hospital with neonatal?  Let us be honest - it is &euro;10 per year for 300 years.  That is the deal.  It is leasehold.  It is not going to be a cardiology hospital.  It is not going to be any other type of hospital.  It is going to be a maternity hospital.<\/p><p>I am pleading for people to at least read the documentation, not try to distort it.

He stated: \"Nobody will have a controlling interest, and nobody will have a beneficial interest, except that the minister for health will have a 'golden share'\", which protects the reserved powers of the new maternity hospital contained in the constitution.

One would honestly believe that the Government has some hidden, covert agenda to create a healthcare environment or a new hospital that would somehow deny people access to the laws that many of us worked for and voted for, in terms of changing the Constitution or enacting legislation in this House to ensure that women had all lawful services available to them.  There is no Government agenda towards that end.  There is no agenda here either from the HSE, which is giving the operational licence to the hospital.<\/p> <p>It is the HSE that insisted on the language of \"clinically appropriate\", not anybody else, because it does not want any other type of hospital built other than a maternity hospital.

What are they saying?  They say they do respect and understand the very genuine fears expressed by many members of the public to their public representatives.  They say they know from experience that the full range of maternity and women's health services are all available to women at the National Maternity Hospital.  They say they are not limited by any religious ethos and will not be in the future.  Future service users, they say, require and deserve state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities, and they urge all political parties in government and opposition to listen to the clinical staff delivering the service and approve this project without further delay.  From earlier correspondence, we know of the desire of about 52 clinicians in Holles Street to get this hospital built and their absolute certainty that all services, including all services concerning reproductive health and the termination of pregnancy, will be provided in the hospital in the future.  The clinicians are saying they will be.  Not only that, the legal documents that have been published, which people should read and which include the constitution of the hospital and the operational licence that will be granted by the HSE to the new hospital, insist that they must be.  There has to be, and is, legally enforceable compliance with the law of the land in terms of services that women are entitled to under the legislation and under the Constitution of the State.  That is what all the negotiations to date have provided for.  All of the issues have been negotiated for the last seven year in respect of the leasehold and so forth.  They are not prepared to give a full freehold title for the land.  We should remember this is co-location.  The site is within a much larger healthcare site.  The optimal value from co-location is related to the very easy access from the delivery rooms in the maternity department to the theatres in St. Vincent's for women who develop complications.  Thanks be to God, complications are rare in modern maternal health but they happen.  Medical expertise says we should co-locate alongside tertiary hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of what happens within a maternity hospital is the delivery of babies and so forth.

One of the reasons it gives is that the floors in the new building, apart from being physically integrated, will have both the national maternity hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital clinical and non-clinical facilities and that, somehow, it would be really difficult to integrate the care of women on these floors between one set of clinicians and the other unless St. Vincent's Healthcare Group group maintained a serious interest in the new national maternity hospital.

Sadly, despite a new awareness in the system that we will struggle to keep the lights on this winter, little has changed to provide long-term solutions for our energy needs.  The cost of living in Ireland is increasing at an alarming rate.  One of the main reasons for the increase is the uncertainty over energy supply and the rising cost of energy and fuels.  Not a single person in Ireland is unaffected by rising costs.  The direct impact of rising fuel costs on farmers, hauliers and fishermen is pushing up the cost of food.  The ongoing situation in Ukraine has highlighted the need for Ireland to be self-sufficient from an energy perspective.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that transitioning to renewable energy sources must be our key focus in the years ahead.  However, oil and gas will be required for at least another two to three decades while we transition to renewables.  We currently import 100% of our oil and coal and 70% of our gas, but we have a unique opportunity to harness an indigenous supply of oil and gas on our doorstep by optimising the Barryroe field off the south-west coast.  This House and our political system need to wake up to the exposure of our security of supply.  Ireland must demonstrate that it has taken all of the necessary measures so that, in the event of disruption, we have the capacity to satisfy the demands of our society and economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Kinsale Head gas field and associated satellite field developments transformed Ireland, being the primary enabler for the formation of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and gas pipeline infrastructure, creating a large number of jobs and stimulating significant industrial development in the Cork area.<\/p> <p>The potential in Barryroe could match that of the Kinsale Head gas field, which has delivered big benefits for the local economy and shown what can be achieved.  It has been worth up to &euro;30 million a year in wages and the provisions of supplies and services.  County Cork, its ports and airports and its skilled workers have shown the infrastructure is there not just to serve the existing fields, which will soon enter wind-down, but to repeat that success all over again.  The potential is not just for gas but also to pave the way for wave, solar and offshore wind.<\/p> <p> What, if anything, has the Government done about pursuing domestic indigenous energy beyond renewable energy?  As I stated, Barryroe is one of the largest undeveloped offshore oil and gas fields in Europe.  It has the potential to provide significant strategic and fiscal value to Ireland and to give it security of supply as well as creating substantial employment opportunities.  I am aware Providence Resources, under the existing exploration licence, submitted the application for a lease undertaking in April 2021.  Ministerial approval of the lease undertaking is urgently required to allow the Barryroe development to move forward.  Who is delaying the development going forward?  What is the Taoiseach going to do about the ongoing delays in respect of this national asset?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000009#G00300","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652191200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  As regards the broader picture around energy supply and security of supply, the very strong focus is on renewables and the entire agenda over the next decade or so will be to develop very significantly offshore wind across the east, west and south-west coasts.  I believe the next decade will witness transformative investment in wind energy in particular, including offshore wind energy, and will create a lot of economic activity on coasts along the western seaboard and in the south west.  The Shannon Estuary and Cork Harbour port will all be significant centres, as will a number of ports on the east coast.  I was in Galway recently for a significant conference on the exploitation of offshore wind with a view to bringing economic benefits to that region.<\/p>  <p>  The consensus in the House, as the Deputy may be aware, over the past two D&aacute;ileanna has been to move towards renewables and away from fossil fuels in general, and particularly, of course, away from exploration for fossil fuels.  I know the Barryroe licence is an existing one, but my understanding is it has been on the go for quite a long time.  By that, I mean it is an area that has been drilled and so on.  There have been different iterations but nothing has ever come to fruition.  I believe there is an application in with the Minister, who, obviously, is considering that application.  It is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of that specific application.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, however, the focus is moving towards renewable energy as the basis for our future energy needs.  As regards the interim, I accept that gas remains a transitional fuel and will be a transitional fuel well into the future as a backup to wind and that those will be the key aspects.  There is no doubt that transitioning to a renewable energy supply base will be challenging in the context of security of supply because the economy has grown at very strong rates in recent years, notwithstanding Brexit and Covid-19, and it continues to grow.  In particular, the foreign direct investment side of our economy has been very strong in terms of new investments in life sciences, technology, financial services, all of which is beneficial, and in terms of the digital economy.  We accept there are challenges in respect of energy into the future but we are in no doubt that the key focus of the State's activity should be the development of offshore wind at critical mass so that in the mid 2030s the nation should be a net exporter of energy through offshore wind exploitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000010#H00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1652191200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Live, horse, and get grass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000010#H00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1652191200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply but, in fairness, the Barryroe field has massive potential.

The concerns about a conflict of interest disclosed by Mr. Hyde on 3 May 2022 relate to a meeting in 2021 and a board decision.  Mr. Hyde states in his correspondence that he became aware of the conflict of interest only on 28 April 2022.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, requested a report from the chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la when he became aware of this matter on 6 May 2022.  The chairperson responded to the Minister on Monday, 9 May, that Mr. Hyde had agreed to absent himself from his duties as deputy chairperson for the time being on a strictly without-prejudice basis, pending completion of the chairperson's analysis of the matters raised.  In this context Mr. Hyde will not be in attendance in the board's offices or have access to the board's electronic systems or documentation, and his case files have been reassigned to ensure the efficient discharge of the functions of the board.

I also thank the staff in the Bills Office and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for their assistance in bringing this forward.  I will share time with my colleague Deputy Conway-Walsh, who is co-signing the Bill.<\/p><p>What this Bill does is straightforward.  It will amend section 10 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 which deals with advertising in order that it will then read that a person shall not publish an advert relating to employment which omits the appropriate remuneration for a contract of employment.  It will then forbid the ads from omitting the appropriate remuneration for the role.  It is complementary to pay transparency and pay reporting, regarding which the Government has already introduced legislation.  However, this is a more immediate and simple measure and is very much in keeping with the overall aim of equality and employment legislation.<\/p><p>Similar legislation has been introduced in other jurisdictions such as Canada, Sweden and Norway.  According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, CIPD, with regard to the gender pay gap in Ireland, the differential between the average pay of males and females within an organisation is estimated at an average of 14% for 2021.  Strong workers' rights legislation, education and childcare are all essential in addressing inequalities, but I hope this will be some small measure also.<\/p><p>It will also prevent jobseekers going to the trouble of applying for employment only to discover a different rate of pay than they initially anticipated.  Pay transparency is important as it allows women and minorities, in particular, to check if they are undertaking similar work for the same rates of pay.  I heard Deputy Griffin mentioning a great Kerryman.  Pay transparency and equality was achieved by another great man, Mike Quill from Kilgarvan, for his members on the buses and subways of New York in the 1950s and 1960s.<\/p><p>The Bill will empower workers to negotiate better pay as they can benchmark themselves against the going rate.  Clarity in terms of pay enables discrimination as women and men are prevented from making a case to be paid the same as colleagues where there is no transparent benchmarking.  The Debenhams workers in Tralee of course were women in the main, and sectors such as retail with a high concentration of women and minorities see more and more violations of workers' rights.  We must put a stop to this.  I hope the Bill goes some small way towards doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000018#R00800","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1652195400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the work of my colleague, Deputy Daly, and his office on this Bill.  The more transparency around wages, the better for all workers as it can help to ensure they get a fair deal from employers.  Pay transparency is also an important tool for tackling the gender pay gap and other forms of pay-related discrimination.  Progress has been made in the area of pay transparency in recent years, as outlined by my colleague.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is an important step in strengthening the position of workers, specifically in the job application process.  The legislation will make it a requirement to publish salaries on job advertisements.  Anyone who has searched for a job, especially online, will be familiar with scrolling down and finding, where one expects to see a salary, instead of an actual figure, phrases such as \"depending on experience&rdquo; or &ldquo;competitive salary&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is that the lack of transparency and asymmetric information reduces the bargaining power of the applicant and skews the power in favour of the employer.  Knowing the salary upfront lets a candidate understand whether a job will be financially viable for him or her before committing the time and effort to apply.  It shows workers already in the job what salaries are being offered to attract new employees.  Leaving the employer to negotiate with the successful candidate on salary after the fact can lead to women, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and minorities often ending up on a lower salary.<\/p>  <p>  An increasing body of research shows salary transparency is a way of creating a more equitable workplace.  In the third level sector, in particular, we know that working conditions for tutors, lecturers and researchers have been eroded by the employment practices of underfunded colleges.  We also know that it is disproportionately women and minorities on precarious contracts.  I recently spoke to a woman who has been moved from short-term contract to short-term contract for 18 years.  We need to skew the contracts and what is offered, in terms of the worker, to protect the worker's rights and give equal power to both the employer and the workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000018#R00900","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1652195400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000018#R01000","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1652195400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000018#R01100","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652195400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652195400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000018#R01300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1652195400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000018#R01400","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652195400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Bills Considered in Select Committee: Motion","time":1652195400,"counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000018#R01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1652195400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders and noting that an Order of referral to Select Committee under Standing Order 181(1) was not made in each case, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann hereby confirms the amendments made to&mdash;

An expansion of the DEIS programme was recently announced, which will benefit 347 schools.  Some 310 schools will be included in DEIS for the first time and 37 existing DEIS primary schools are being reclassified and will be eligible for increased supports.  This will mean a &euro;32 million increase in the Department of Education's expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, which will be the largest-ever single investment in the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, Government decided that income-contingent loans for fees would not form part of the future funding model for higher education.

It has just lost a special education teacher because of the crude way in which the allocations are made.  The school is appealing the decision, and I hope the Minister will consider that appeal.  The principal pointed out that the figures are crudely based on the number of children coming in with a diagnosis in junior infants and those leaving in sixth class.  What is not taken into account is that many children identified as having special needs are not identified until later.  Often, the school must help with that being done and with the children going through the system.  The assessments can take up to two years.<\/p> <p> Something I did not know is that some parents, because of the long waiting lists, then get private assessments but, incredibly, those private assessments are not counted in the HSE's figures because the two systems do not join up.

They really should not have to have protests, to take court cases against the State and to try to pressurise for just their basic rights.

These wonderful services are being provided for about 1,000 children each year now.

Therefore, the model the Department of Education uses to determine deprivation and the need to intervene in a school context is based on Pobal and census figures dating from 2016.  The review is good and welcome, and most schools in County Clare and around the country that have had their designations changed welcome what happened in March.  It does not, however, fully take into account transients, those in rental accommodation who move every few months.  Living in one home for many years is simply not the case for many families.  Equally, many schools I can think of in Clare had 50 or 60 pupils, all with English as a first language, at the start of this academic year, but that situation has now been flipped on its head.  I know of one school that has doubled its enrolment, and where those with English as a first language are the minority.  Therefore, DEIS needs to be reviewed in this context.

My sense of this situation is that we have a more direct route to dealing with special needs in education through the National Council for Special Education.  The allocation of resources happens much faster in respect of delivery in the school.  The same does not apply in the health service.  It seems to be far more opaque regarding the allocation of resources in the health service and the follow-through in that regard in terms of delivery on the ground, if I am honest about it, and I am not happy with that.  We must increasingly use the school-based model for therapists.  As the Deputy is aware, a pilot scheme was developed some years ago, and that has been effective.  The progressing disabilities services, PDS, model is diluting the level of provision in special schools.  To be fair, that policy was announced about ten years ago, but it has been slow in the delivery.  Some good centres have been created, but the model of a multidisciplinary team on a school campus is one I would like to see more of.  That said, there has been a significant expansion of special needs provision in schools for the past 20-odd years, manifested in the thousands of special needs assistants and resource teachers in our schools.  Those are the facts.  There has also been the creation of autism classes.  More needs to be done, however, and it is particularly the case in this area of multidisciplinary teams.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, and Deputy Murphy raised this issue, I do not want any court cases or protests.  There should not have to be protests or court cases in respect of children with special needs.  I brought in the Education Act 1998 and automatic enrolment for children with special needs, also in 1998, which was the first time children with autism had a special pupil-teacher ratio, or that any children with special needs had such a ratio.  That brought in special classes within mainstream schools and then children within the mainstream classes themselves.  Those developments have not followed through at post-primary level.  It is crazy there is only one school in Tallaght at post-primary level with an autism class.  I envisage a greater role for the ETBs in the provision of special education, especially at post-primary level.  Every secondary and post-primary school should play its part in respect of providing for children with special needs.  A proper second level curriculum must be provided and there should be an intake of pupils by all schools.  This should certainly be resolved based on catchment area.  It cannot be left to just one school to provide in this regard.  In any event, given the needs of post-primary autism, one school will have a limit to what it can do because of issues with progression, space and facilities.<\/p> <p>There have been some very good examples where post-primary schools have embraced this.  Recently in Cork, the ETB started a new special school at post-primary level and it has turned out to be a significant success.  The ETBs need to play a stronger role across the country in being the patrons of new schools, at post-primary level especially, and to make sure children have rightful progression from primary to post-primary.  The same sort of revolution has not happened at post-primary level as has happened at primary level over the past 20 years.  That needs to be corrected.  That may mean some strengthening of existing legislation that obliges schools and gives the Minister powers to direct schools to take children in.<\/p> <p> Deputy Bacik has also raised this issue in the context of the Rainbow Club.  I am glad she visited it.  It is an example of what can be done outside of the box or outside formal structures to create opportunities for parents and children.  It has been a fantastic success over the years.  They seem to have an easier capacity to recruit specialist therapists also, even though their facilities are not optimal, if I am honest, as regards the hall and so on in Mahon.  They have made a big impact.<\/p> <p> On DEIS, I take Deputy Crowe's points about how one assesses deprivation, disadvantage and so on in the modern era, particularly with a much more mobile population.  The older designations may not apply to some more mobile residents in a given area.  Currently 884 schools and more than 180,000 students benefit from the DEIS programme.  The Minister recently announced the expansion of the programme benefiting 347 schools.  Some 310 schools will be included in DEIS for the first time, and 37 existing DEIS primary schools are being reclassified and will be eligible for increased supports.  That means in the 2022-2023 school year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS programme, serving in excess of 240,000 students.  That is one in four students in a disadvantaged scheme, to give additional weighting and teacher allocations and supports to the schools.  That is a &euro;32 million increase in the Department's expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023 onwards, the largest single investment ever undertaken by a Government in the DEIS programme.  The programme was started by Fianna F&aacute;il many years ago.  I am glad to see it is getting such an expansion.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Barry, again I am not aware of the individual concerned but there has to be proper understanding and empathy in issues pertaining to trans people and the whole LGBTQI community.  Legislation is one dimension but the most important dimension is the curriculum reform that is currently under way by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000019#S00600","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1652196600,"counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000020#T00200"},{"type":"question","time":1652196600,"counter":226,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[20604\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000020#T00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health will next meet.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1652196600,"counter":227,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[20607\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000020#T00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health will next meet.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1652196600,"counter":228,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[21060\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000020#T00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health will next meet.","asker":"1698","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1652196600,"counter":229,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[22933\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000020#T00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health will next meet.","asker":"1519","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1652196600,"counter":230,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[22945\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000020#T00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health will next meet.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1652196600,"counter":231,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[22980\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000020#T00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health will next meet.","asker":"1560","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1652196600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 13, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on health oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in health, receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers the implementation of health reforms, including Sl&aacute;intecare.

There has been a lot of pressure on emergency departments but also on basic services since the ending of the emergency phase of the pandemic.  We need a clear focus on long Covid in time to get a central register of people who have the condition, because that would inform better practice and protocols on its treatment and also enable more informed allocation of resources to the health service and a better focus.  I will engage with the Minister for Health on this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of the roll-out of free GP care.  I do not believe funding was provided in 2017; I think the policy was announced then.  Negotiations and discussions are ongoing or beginning with the IMO in respect of the extension to six- and seven-year-olds.  We need to change the way we announce and deal with this because it becomes an annual negotiation once it is announced at budget time.  Very often, the leverage of the State or taxpayer in the negotiations is weakened by the prior announcement.  There needs to be common sense and perspective regarding this among all parties.  In our view, we want to increase eligibility.  There has been very significant engagement with GPs throughout Covid, and there was a beneficial co-operative agreement, but essential additional resources were provided as well.  It is in that context that I hope we can get the six- to seven-year-olds dealt with relatively quickly and then assess how to deal with our collective aspiration to increase universal access to GP care, in particular.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Crowe raised the issue of University Hospital Limerick.  There is no doubt that it has been the scene of far too much overcrowding.  Notwithstanding the very significant investment in the hospital in recent times, the Minister has sent down a specialist team to determine how the hospital can develop an optimal model for governance and dealing with the issues and the pressure on it.  In the medium term, there is a need for more inpatient beds and capacity in the hospital group covering the region.  The hospitals in the group, namely Ennis, Nenagh and St. John&rsquo;s, have a role to play in alleviating the pressure.  Sometimes that means some hospitals must take on specific roles or develop additional services that do not need to be provided in the tertiary hospital.  The Beaumont group of hospitals comprises a good example of how services are spread.  However, there are particular pressure points in Limerick that have to be acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised the issue of disability services.

In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, this Government has been very active in terms of committing a whole range of research, through the shared island project, ESRI and NESC.  The first systematic and comprehensive research into North-South systems, be that education, health, enterprise and so forth, is of broad use to all of us who wish to share the island together into the future.  It is the first time this has happened on a systematic basis.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Haughey and Bacik raised issues regarding engagement with the British Government.  Deputy Haughey asked specifically about the prime minister.<\/p>  <p>  I want to congratulate all of those elected to the Northern Assembly.  I congratulate the performance of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.  All of its MLAs were returned.  It is not the first time that a nationalist party topped the first preference poll, but it is the first time that this has been turned into the most seats in the Assembly.  That is a significant moment.  I also acknowledge the extraordinary success of the Alliance Party's surge, whereby it not only maintained its seats from the last Assembly but more than doubled its presence.  One very interesting feature of the Assembly campaign was the fact that every party but one ended up running a campaign based on the cost of living, the health crisis and the need for the Assembly to intervene and help people.  The one exception to that ended up failing to add a single seat in the assembly, namely the TUV.  Any attempt to apply different rationales to the vote after the event must be resisted.<\/p>  <p>  I have outlined to the House that I spoke to all of the leaders yesterday by phone.  I take them at their word.  Each had their own words when they said they respect the outcome of the election and want to go back to work, even though many are coming from different perspectives.  This morning, I spoke to the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.  We had a frank and honest exchange on the blockages to progress.  I reiterated my view that what is needed is a proper and professional intensification of the EU-UK discussions regarding implementation of the protocol.  I set out in very clear terms my serious concerns about any unilateral action at this time.<\/p> <p>I shared my view that this would be the wrong approach.  It would be destabilising in Northern Ireland and it would further erode trust.<\/p> <p> I also made the point to the Prime Minister that responsibility for ensuring the safeguarding and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is the joint responsibility of the United Kingdom and the Irish Government.  There is no place for unilateralism in this role.  I have been a long-term believer that progress in Northern Ireland is achieved only when the UK and the Irish Government are working closely together in a common cause.  We both agreed it was important that the Assembly and the Executive would be re-established and get up and running.<\/p> <p> I challenged, and continue to challenge, the view in terms of what I believe to be a false narrative.  Deputy Haughey is correct that it has been asserted that the European Commission is not taking steps to address disruption being caused on the ground in Northern Ireland as a result of the operation of the protocol.  That is not the case.  It is simply not true and it must be challenged at every available opportunity.  The Commission, and Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d in particular, have done an extraordinary volume of work.  He has demonstrated consistent good faith in seeking to understand and address the specific issues that are causing concern.  For example, the issue of medicines, which at one time we were told was the primary cause of concern, has now been dealt with.  Last October, Vice President &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d put forward a substantial package of flexibilities and mitigations, including on customs and sanitary and phytosanitary arrangements.  What is required now is a proper reciprocation of that effort and the good faith offered by the European Union.<\/p> <p> I believe the leaders of the Northern parties when they say they want to get back to the Executive and deliver for their constituents.  I believe the job of the two Governments is to work together constructively to make that happen.  We will have difficult challenges ahead in that regard.  I think we have to witness the intensification of those negotiations between the United Kingdom Government and the European Commission.<\/p> <p> In terms of the issue of the amnesty, raised by Deputy Bacik, I welcome the moves made by the British Government in that respect.  It has listened to the parties in Northern Ireland and, critically, the victims' groups, but we will want to see more detail in respect of what specifically it intends to propose.  Again, however, there is no room for unilateralism in such matters.  These are issues that were agreed by everybody as far back as 2010.  They were agreed between the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland parties.  I have met with many victims' groups and they want closure; they do not want amnesties.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cathal Crowe raised the issue of the national aviation strategy.  Again, I will raise that with the Minister.  Of course, I believe that airports such as Shannon Airport are critical in such a national aviation strategy, and particularly in the context of continental connectivity.<\/p> <p> I have dealt comprehensively with the questions put by Deputy Haughey.<\/p> <p> In terms of the points raised by Deputy Daly, I ask that he give me some background to the case.  We stand ready as a Government.  We have honoured our commitments in terms of legacy.  We want to see a proper framework developed around legacy, where families can get closure or, at least, get inquests held or get access to information that would assist them in understanding who murdered or killed their loved ones and the background to the manner in which their loved ones were killed.  Again, too much of this has just dragged on for far too long - on all sides, may I add.  There is also a lot of hurt out there in terms of murders and deaths that were caused by paramilitaries and by state forces.  There is a need for a system that brings closure to the victims to some extent.  They may never get complete closure.  This has just dragged on far too long, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000022#V00900","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652198400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Is f&eacute;idir teacht ar Cheisteanna Scr&iacute;ofa ar www.oireachtas.ie.\r\n\r\nWritten Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Europe Day: Statements","time":1652198400,"counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000023#W00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1652198400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>D&aacute;il statements to mark Europe Day have become an important fixture in our annual political calendar.  This is not least a reminder of the democratic idea that is at the heart of the European Union and the shared values underpinning it.  It was on 9 May 1950 that Robert Schuman set out his vision for a new form of co-operation in Europe.  The historic Schuman Declaration invited a new beginning for the European Continent, one that would end generations of deeply destructive conflict and division and set the path to what has evolved to become today's European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Europe Day marks the successful development, over decades, of a deeply interconnected area of peace, stability and shared prosperity on the Continent of Europe.  It is inspired by giving practical and multilateral expression to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris in December 1948, less than 18 months before the Schuman initiative.  It reminds us of the deep bond that is the part we play together in advancing and defending our shared values through the democratic process.<\/p>  <p>  That we are marking Europe Day 2022 here in the Oireachtas is especially appropriate.  Exactly 50 years ago today, on 10 May 1972, the Irish people made one of the most consequential decisions in the history of the State, voting by an overwhelming majority to join the then European Communities.  More than 83% voted \"Yes\" to approve the Third Amendment to the Constitution, amending Article 29 to enable Community legislation to have the force of law in Ireland.  Of the 1.8 million eligible voters, 1.2 million voted - a turnout of 70.9% - and all constituencies across the country were solidly in favour.  The lowest \"Yes\" vote, recorded in Dublin South-West, was 73%, and the highest, in Donegal North-East, was 91.7%.  That referendum followed the signing in Brussels on 22 January 1972 of the accession treaty by Jack Lynch, as Taoiseach, and Dr. Patrick Hillery, as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Few events in our history as an independent State have been so transformative.<\/p>  <p>  The five decades since have witnessed Ireland emerge as a truly modern and open economy and society, one that contributes to and benefits from the close relationship and co-operation it enjoys with its European partners.  Far from diminishing our sovereignty as a people, our membership of the European Union has helped to strengthen it, giving us a reach and influence that we would not otherwise enjoy.  Not all were positively disposed to the new possibilities that joining the European Communities would open.  Our newly found independence, just 50 years old, was fragile and jealously guarded but those convinced that Ireland's future lay in Europe showed the courage to imagine a new Ireland with a more confident and optimistic future.  Jack Lynch described it as a courage to respond to \"the call made by the founding members to other countries of Europe who shared their ideals to join in their efforts to establish the foundations of an ever-closer union among the European peoples\".   This included not least the ideal of a vital force for peace in the world, and an ever-increasing contribution to the economic and social progress of developing nations.  As is so often the case, the courageous decision was the right decision.  The past 50 years have seen a transformative and overwhelmingly positive impact of EU membership across all dimensions of our society.<\/p>  <p>  The shared community we joined has widened and deepened in the 50 years since.  It has become a beacon of democracy and prosperity, especially for those in our wider neighbourhood who want to join, and to enjoy the benefits and the protections that come with belonging to a community of values and of laws.  During our EU Presidency of 2004 it was our honour and privilege to welcome ten new member states, mostly countries from central and eastern Europe that emerged as new and restored democracies after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Now, we see the next wave looking to join - the countries of the western Balkans as well as countries like Georgia, Moldova and, of course, Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  For the people of Ukraine, the journey to EU membership is an aspiration of the most profound kind.  As we meet, it is enduring an horrific and violent war orchestrated by a man and by a regime that does not want to see Ukraine fulfil its European aspiration and perspective.  Irish people have been enormously moved by the extraordinary courage and bravery of the people of Ukraine in defending their country and their right to shape their own future.  We have opened up our country, and indeed our homes, to welcome those fleeing from the war, guided by an empathy rooted in our own history and strong values.  President Zelenskyy, including in his remarks to the joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas on 6 April, has called for accountability for the perpetrators of unspeakable crimes in Ukraine, and for an accelerated process to allow Ukraine to join the European Union.<\/p> <p>I have made clear to him that he has my full support and I know that sentiment is shared across this House.  I reiterated our support to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal when I met him in Shannon last month.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is not acting alone in our response.  We are a committed member of the wider European family.  Our membership of the European Union provides us with a seat at a shared table and a voice at the heart of Europe.  The Union has rightly condemned the war as inhumane, immoral and unjustifiable, and has taken unprecedented decisions and actions to lend its support to Ukraine.  Acting together, we have moved swiftly to adopt the strongest, most hard-hitting packages of sanctions in our history.  We are providing billions of euro in support for the people of Ukraine.  With our international partners, we are committed to helping to rebuild a free and independent Ukraine when the war is over.<br\/><br\/>The EU is one of the finest examples of conflict resolution and peacebuilding the world has ever seen.  Next month, I hope to have the honour of unveiling a bust of one of the greatest Irish people and Europeans of the 20th century, John Hume, in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.  It will stand in a place where he was held in enormously high regard and where he made an immense contribution.  John Hume told the European Parliament that, from his own experience, the three principles at the heart of the European Union are the same principles that came to underpin peace in Ireland.  They are respect for difference - after all, that is what all conflict is about - institutions that respect difference; and working together in the common interest and, in doing so, breaking down the barriers of the past.<br\/><br\/>The EU played a significant part in our journey towards peace and reconciliation on this island.  It provided a valuable shared space in which Irish and British Ministers could co-operate and get to know each other.  Those relationships helped to develop the mutual trust and understanding that were so important throughout the peace process.  Our European partners also made, and continue to make, their contribution through the strongest and most steadfast of support by way of generous peace and reconciliation programmes that benefit communities North and South and strengthen prosperity across this island.<br\/><br\/>Our EU partners have stood by Ireland as we worked together to manage the unique challenges for this island resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union, making the objective of sustaining peace, avoiding a hard border and protecting the all-island economy a major priority from the very beginning of negotiations.  It is perhaps hard to believe that as we approach the sixth anniversary of the British referendum, we are still discussing the arrangements between us.  Where we are is a reflection of the genuine complexity of what was presented as a simple question, when it was anything but.  As we continue work to find a way forward on the Northern Ireland protocol and make its operation as smooth and seamless for the people of Northern Ireland as possible, our EU partners stand with us and in support of peace and the Good Friday Agreement.  Like Ireland, our EU partners want to build a strong and productive relationship with the UK for the future.  As we have seen with Ukraine, we are stronger when we work together.  However, a strong and productive relationship can only be built on a firm foundation of trust.<br\/><br\/>When I visited the National Archives of Ireland in January to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the accession treaty, I made the point that EU membership exposed Ireland to new ideas and to new, more generous and compassionate ways of thinking.  Membership gave us the impetus we needed to strengthen our human rights record, drive forward civil and social rights, introduce gender equality legislation, improve protection of workers' rights and become a much more tolerant, kinder and inclusive country than the Ireland of 1972.  We now play our part in seeking to advance and defend the Union's shared values, namely, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights within the Union and throughout the world.  We are proud that Ireland has become a beacon to others of what the EU can help a country to achieve, never more so than when we hosted the Day of Welcomes for the new member states in May 2004.<br\/><br\/>The EU will continue to evolve in the coming years.  Yesterday's report from the Conference on the Future of Europe marks another contribution towards shaping its future.  It has been an unprecedented exercise in EU-wide direct citizen engagement and has generated a huge number of ideas and suggestions that will require careful and considered reflection.  As we look back on the 50 years of our membership, it is important that we look to the future too.  I hope people across Ireland, including Deputies in this House and all those who value the EU and its contribution to this country and the world, continue to make their voices heard.  We have much to contribute and much to gain.<br\/><br\/>Speaking at the historic signing ceremony in Brussels in 1972, the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, remarked:<\/p><blockquote>\tGeography has placed us on the periphery of the Continent.  But we are an integral part of Europe, bound to it by many centuries of shared civilisation, traditions and ideals.  Ireland, because of historical circumstances, did not participate in the past in all the great moments of European experience but the Irish people have in many periods of our history been deeply involved in the life and culture of the European mainland.  Since statehood, my country, conscious of its European past, has sought to forge new and stronger links with the Continent.  In this we were renewing and revitalizing historic bonds. <\/blockquote> <p>I endorse his words today.  I believe the same spirit of optimism, aspiration and hope should remain a powerful guiding force as we mark Europe Day, reflect on what has been and imagine what is yet to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000023#W00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652199000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>It is particularly fitting that today's statements coincide with a most important anniversary, that is, the 50th anniversary of when Ireland voted 83% in favour of joining the then European Economic Community, EEC.

The declaration stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt [is proposed] that Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of Europe.  The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development... <\/blockquote>  <p>Mr. Schuman went on to say: &quot;The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.&quot;  By merging coal and steel production, the objective was not just to lay the foundations for economic development but to lay the foundations for permanent peace between France and Germany.  That is what has happened.  It is why I find it so frustrating that at every referendum on EU matters, we hear about the Union being a force of war or conflict, when, in fact, it is the exact opposite and its record proves it.  That is why the Irish people support it.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I was pleased to go with the Danish ambassador to a number of schools.  Denmark joined the EEC at the same time as Ireland.  We wanted to join for various reasons but we also kind of had to because Britain was joining and we had huge trade dependencies with it.  That seems ironic now given that Britain has left the Union and our trade dependency on that country has reduced substantially as a result of our EU membership.  In contrast to what anti-EEC campaigners said at the time, I believe our sovereignty has been massively enhanced by being at the European table.  There is no question whatsoever about that.  Nevertheless, it was a courageous decision to join.  We had gained our independence only 50 years before we voted to join the EEC, but I think our people understood the full benefits.<\/p><p>We have since seen a transformative change in our country, including the development of an open economy, freedom of movement and the single currency, to name just a few developments.  The right of women to equal pay rates, on which Ireland and a number of other countries were behind at the time, was a condition of our membership.  The Government had to make a specific decision in that regard and the Taoiseach and I have seen the memorandum relating to that decision.  It was an Irish Commissioner who drove that change on within Europe.  Although Europe forced us along a particular road, there were Irish people involved in bringing the entire Union forward on that road.<\/p><p>I take the opportunity to remind the House that while a lot of Irish people have joined the then EEC's civil service and administration from the 1970s on, many have since retired and one third of our staff there are due to retire in the next three years.  We are campaigning really hard to ensure Irish people think carefully about careers within the EU.  Indeed, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have just had a meeting with Commissioner Hahn, who is in Dublin today, on that very topic.<\/p><p>On Ukraine, EU member states are working together to confront shared challenges.  It is more important than ever that the Union is united and internally strong.  At the same time, we should not be too frustrated when decisions around Ukraine and other difficult issues take time to make.  The EU is a democracy made up of 27 separate democracies, the representatives of which sit around a table.  The truth is that it is complicated to make that democracy work.  We need patience, understanding and compromises.<\/p> <p>When the European Council takes three days to make a decision or, indeed, does not make a decision, we should never regard that as a failure but simply as democracy in action.  Sometimes agreement just cannot be reached.  However, on the major issues of our time in recent years, whether Ukraine, the vaccine programme or Brexit, we have seen extraordinary unity around the European table.  It does not come automatically or straightforwardly but it does come and is worth working for, and that work takes time.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach spoke about the desire of the Ukrainian people to join the European Union.  I was so proud of our Taoiseach when he made his very clear statement in that regard a number of weeks ago.  The Ukrainian people have made great efforts to defend their democracy and their rights to free speech and free media.  That is really important for the EU and makes Ukraine an important ally of ours in respect of democracy, human rights and freedom.  The EU, of course, is committed to supporting the Ukrainian Government with its immediate needs and, when this war ends, as it will end, with the reconstruction of the country.  The European Union, through the European Council, has agreed to adopt a Ukraine solidarity trust fund.<\/p> <p> As for Brexit, the protocol was designed and agreed by the UK and the EU to address the challenges faced by Northern Ireland following the UK's decision to leave the EU.  The protocol protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions.  It fully recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, to which there is no threat, and recognises the principle of consent.  All sides need to work to ensure calm in the post-election period as parties endeavour to form an executive, and we wish them well in doing so.  Everybody must, however, remember what John Hume told us about the three sets of relationships, which are obvious now but may not have seemed as obvious when Hume set them out.  There are the very important relationships within Northern Ireland, which we now see in practice with the hoped-for setting up of an executive.  There are also the North-South dimension and the east-west relationship, which are very important.  Those relationships underline and underpin the entire Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p> It is incumbent on the British Government to continue working in the spirit of what the Taoiseach and the European Union have offered to underpin that peace, not to take any one-sided or unilateral moves, and always to remember that every action taken in Northern Ireland affects a very delicate place.  That action must be taken together.  That is better.  Any unilateral action would be an unnecessary source of tension at a time when we need to work together.  The European Commission has come forward with wide-ranging solutions and remains fully committed to working with the UK.  The issue of medicines was a big one in this area this time last year.  That issue has been completely resolved in recent weeks.  A huge amount of effort went into that.  I pay tribute to those Members of the D&aacute;il, Members of the European Parliament and members of the Government who contributed to make that happen.  Nobody sought publicity for any of the work they did on it, but a huge amount of work was done to ensure Brexit did not ultimately cause disruption to the supply of medicines in Northern Ireland.  We are happy and do not want a fuss.  We did not want to be seen to be interfering in the elections, but that issue has been resolved.  It is a sign of the European Union's good faith.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach spoke about the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I thank the Oireachtas Members who went to the plenary debates, namely, Deputy Brady, Deputy Niamh Smyth from my party, Deputy Richmond and Senator Higgins.  I thank our citizens' representative, Noelle O Connell, and the citizens randomly selected to take part in the Conference on the Future of Europe and the plenaries and citizens' panels.  Their work has kind of gone unheralded.  I have been encouraging them to make themselves known to the media.  They will have to do that themselves.  These randomly selected citizens have done a huge amount of work.  We do not know who they are, but they have played a significant role in the conference and in setting Europe's and Ireland's future direction.  I was glad to meet a number of them in Strasbourg.  Their work should be heralded more.  The Government was very conscious that they had to do that work independently, and they have done so.<\/p> <p> There will be a lot of work ahead on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  Big decisions will have to be made.  The European Parliament has already spoken on it.  The Council of the European Union will have to consider the recommendations, some of which are far-reaching.  The important point is that we have a debate and democracy.  Nobody is going to force anybody down any particular road.  That is not what the European Union is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000024#X00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652199600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>We mark the 72nd anniversary of the Schuman Declaration at a time of great challenge to the European family.  This would have been true of Brexit alone, but now we contend with a triple threat of crises which test our community of nations in ways which seemed unimaginable a few years ago.  Today, Europe and the world emerge from a pandemic that has resulted in heartbreaking loss of life and unprecedented disruption to European health systems, economies and communities.  The cost-of-living crisis and energy prices have workers, families and businesses reeling as inflation soars to levels not seen for decades.  While Russia's criminal, brutal invasion of Ukraine has resulted in the greatest displacement of people in Europe since the Second World War, the outbreak of conflict in Europe reminds us that peace, self-determination and sovereignty are precious and can never be taken for granted.  Ireland stands with Ukraine as its people fight for the very survival of their nation.  Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called on the Government to expel the Russian ambassador from Ireland as he continues to act as a propagandist for military aggression and savage war crimes.  The Government has said it will expel Mr. Filatov only as part of an EU-wide initiative.  In that case such a position should be proposed and advanced by the Taoiseach and the Minister at European Council meetings.  Of course, diplomacy must always be the goal, but diplomacy can work only with those who embrace it.  Ireland should not be a haven for so-called diplomats who have turned their faces against diplomacy in favour of brutality and the violation of international law.<\/p><p>Despite the difficulties created, the people of the European Union have shown their resolve in supporting necessary economic sanctions against Russia.  European governments should have similar resolve in not allowing mouthpieces for Russia's barbaric invasion to remain <i>in situ<\/i>.  The journey to peace and the resolution of conflict can have only one credible starting point.  Vladimir Putin must end his war and immediately withdraw his military from Ukraine.  As thousands of Ukrainian families seek refuge, the people of Ireland are living the European value of solidarity.  They have been welcoming and generous.  We must do everything we can to meet this humanitarian crisis.<\/p><p>The challenge must kick-start a long-overdue emergency response from the Government to deliver for everyone in housing need.  The Government has failed spectacularly to get to grips with a housing crisis that defined life in Ireland long before the war in Ukraine, Covid and Brexit.  The time for a radical change in direction is now.  We urgently need an ambitious housing plan that leaves no family or person behind.  Workers, families and businesses across Europe are being hammered by a cost-of-living crisis and, in particular, skyrocketing fuel and energy costs.  Many can no longer afford to heat their homes or fill their cars to get to work.  While the European Commission has been proactive in putting in place a toolbox of measures that allow EU member states to keep fuel and electricity prices low, the Irish Government's response and its engagement with the EU have been slow and stuttering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000025#Y00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1652199600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>That is not correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000025#Y00300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1652199600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The piecemeal measures taken by this coalition have not worked and, incredibly, we have yet to see any action to reduce the cost of home heating oil.

Government inertia in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis is also highlighted by the fact that Ireland has yet to receive a single euro from our &euro;990 million share of the EU's recovery and resilience fund.  That recovery plan was agreed nine months ago.  This month Italy and Greece received allocations from the fund, but Ireland lags behind in drawing down our share.  That is unacceptable, given that a large part of Ireland's plan is focused on bringing about the green revolution we need.  Plans to extend a schools broadband programme and health projects are also dependent on this funding being drawn down.<\/p> <p>It is time for the Government to get its act together and start drawing down this funding to which we are entitled.<\/p> <p> Fifty years ago, Ireland voted to join the EU.  Today we can be to the fore in changing Europe.  There has never been a better time.  Across member states, more and more people are turning to the advancement of the collective public good over private interests.  In the midst of the turbulence created by the crisis we now face, there is a real chance to shape a future built on the shared European values of solidarity, equality, human dignity and democracy.  As the desire for a fairer, more democratic society grows stronger, our focus must not be on making Europe more insular, militarised or disconnected from citizens.  There is an historic chance to build a social Europe in which ordinary people come together and come first.  European can and must be a Europe of peace and social and economic justice, a haven for diversity and a bastion of human rights and internationalism.  Austerity, neoliberalism and militarisation have failed and now, as a community of nations, we have to get the basics right.  This means working together to ensure our people have affordable housing and access to world-class public healthcare and education - the foundations of a good life where every person has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  There are those who use the crisis we now endure as alibis to do the opposite - to retreat into narrow thinking and block progress.  They say we must cut our way out of economic difficulty and working people must pay a heavy price.  They say we must arm our way out of military conflict and Ireland should surrender its neutrality.  They are wrong.  Ireland's future in Europe is too big and too bright for such a retreat.<\/p> <p> Now is a time for a vision of Ireland as a European leader of prosperity, peace and hope.  We have an opportunity to lead towards a greener cleaner world to protect our children's futures by protecting the environment through ambitious and fair change.  Ireland can lead the way by becoming an international hub of clean energy through the development of our wind energy and renewable resources.  It can be done.  We only have to show the determination and ambition to get it done.  By showing leadership now, we can carve out a legacy to leave the generations that will follow us a just, green and clean environment.<\/p> <p> The signing of the Schuman Declaration and the fall of the Berlin Wall mark milestones of change for Europe.  We stand at another watershed.  Nowhere in Europe are the winds of change blowing more strongly than here in Ireland.  This is a truth underscored by the historical election result in the North.  The tectonic plates of Irish politics have shifted immeasurably.  We all have a responsibility to prepare for the future.  I see that future as a united Ireland, not only in the European Union but driving change within Europe.  We need an inclusive citizens' assembly to plan reunification and prepare for a referendum, a forum for everyone in which our unionist citizens and new communities can voice their opinions and views in a spirit of goodwill and progress.<\/p> <p> In making a peaceful and successful transition to unity we will, once again, look to the support of our European partners, the same positive and energetic support they showed for the Good Friday Agreement and in securing and defending the protocol.  Just as both Governments should prepare for unity, the European Union must also ready itself for the day Ireland joins as a united nation.  The reunification of Ireland can be a catalyst for real change, not only at home but right across the EU.<\/p> <p> We have a real choice.  The future of Europe can be one of reactionary retreat or one of ambitious progress, a future of citizen disillusionment or a future of citizen empowerment, a future of continued privilege for the few or one of opportunity and prosperity for all.  Now is the time not to hold anxious to the past but to reach forward with confidence.  If we act together with common purpose, we can build a new Ireland and revive the vision of Europe as a beacon of partnership, solidarity and equality, a changed Europe from which a changed and united Ireland finally takes its rightful place among the nations of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000025#Y00800","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652200200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes in and supports the European Union and the prospect of peace, prosperity and unity for all its people.  That is at the core of what Europe is about.  All of those things come with challenges.  When we think of prosperity, which is the promise of Europe, it has been delivered for many people on this island and in other parts of Europe but we cannot ignore that we have also had difficult times.  I think of the impact of the Stability and Growth Pact and the rules and regulations that have bound nation states in being able to develop their economies, not only during the recent period of austerity but long before that as well.  Thankfully, Europe seems to have moved away from austerity.  During this economic crisis, it seems to be recognised that Europe needs to invest in people and ensure that investment is delivered to people everywhere.  We need to see that happen across the entire European Union, particularly in Ireland.  The Government has a crucial role in making that happen.<\/p>  <p>  We recognise that Europe has been good to people in many ways.  The progress we see in certain areas must continue.  We have concerns, however, about the continued and increasing militarisation of the EU.  It is important that we maintain the freedom to develop our own independent foreign policy.  It is also important that there is space for militarily non-aligned and neutral states to be at the heart of the European Union.  That is part of what we are about and we also need to recognise that.  We need to move away from the sense that Europe will have some kind of militarised force to protect our borders.  I see all these people coming from Ukraine and being welcomed.  The European Union has done great work in bringing people from Ukraine to all parts of Europe, including Ireland, yet the EU is housing thousands of migrants on islands off the coast of Greece.  The difference we see in the treatment of two groups of people fleeing war is something on which Europe needs to reflect on the 50th anniversary of Ireland joining into the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  We deplore and condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and stand in solidarity with all the people of Ukraine.  The EU, including Ireland, should be doing more to help countries in eastern Europe, particularly Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe that is shouldering the majority of the effort in dealing with refugees from that conflict.  Thousands of Irish people have been donating and bringing all kinds of goods to parts of eastern Europe to help people who are fleeing from war.  That sense of generosity is at the heart of the Irish people's and the European Union's response and it is what Europe is about.  We need to ensure the Europe we develop reflects that generosity and the sense of people coming together for the greater good.  It cannot be just for the good of the great.  That has been the problem many people have seen with Europe in the past.  That needs to be reflected on as we move forward, particularly in this crisis arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and in other crises coming at us hard and fast, particularly the climate crisis.  We need to invest in climate change efforts.  If we are to address these issues, we must have resources to do so.  Ireland or any other country in Europe alone will not have those resources.  They must come through the common work of all of the countries of Europe in coming together and recognising that, for the global future, we invest to build the energy resources we need, which will not damage our climate, planet and future generations.  The European Union has a central role to play in all of that and it needs to take that role very seriously.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the recommendations of the Conference on the Future of Europe and the work that was done.  We recognise that the future of Europe belongs to all of us and is not only for the elites.  The problem in the past has been that we have not been able to an understanding that it is about all of the people and all of them have a role to play in ensuring the European Union delivers for communities in every part of the world, particularly every part of Ireland.  In the part of the country I come from and elsewhere in the west, we do not have the kind of investment we require.  Europe has to play a role in all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000026#Z00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1652200800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the opportunity to speak today to mark Europe Day.  It is a particularly auspicious date as today we also mark 50 years since the referendum to join the then European Economic Community was held and passed in Ireland.  Since then the EU has driven social and economic change across Ireland, for the most part for the better.  In particular, the equal rights of women have been advanced through the passage of EU laws.  There have also been difficulties, of course, and the Labour Party has been very critical in many instances of the European project over the years, including at the initial point of holding the referendum 50 years ago.  All of us are cognisant of the rigid economic approach taken by the EU and the ECB to the economic crash in 2009 that led to us losing our sovereignty as a nation.  However, with Brexit and most recently with the horrific and brutal war in Ukraine, we have seen how the EU has acted collectively and strongly in solidarity and how being an integral part of the EU has amplified and strengthened our voice as a nation within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Learning from the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen the potential for stronger integration across the EU in healthcare, most notably in collective purchases.  After a slow and difficult start, with difficult issues around the purchasing of equipment, in particular, the EU worked together on vaccine purchase and we, as a small country, were able to access vaccines through an EU deal that a similar country might have struggled to secure without that collective strength.  The war in Ukraine has shown the real potential for greater collective solidarity across EU nations through working to ensure security of supply and a refusal to deal with Russian oil and gas.  This also has massive implications for our policies on climate.  Indeed, one of the strongest and most positive aspects of EU policy in recent years is the European new green deal.  It is important we see that collective solidarity come to the fore in working on tackling climate emissions and in meeting climate targets.  Today, there was a stark and dire warning from the World Meteorological Organization regarding the path we are on currently, with a 50:50 chance that average global temperatures will exceed the Paris goal of 1.5&deg;C over the next five years.  That shows the vital importance of working collectively to ensure effective action on climate.<\/p>  <p>  The war in Ukraine has put in clear focus the initial project of the EU as a peace project, in its institution shortly after the Second World War and in the aftermath of that war and the devastation wreaked across the Continent.  It was born out of a desire to deliver closer economic and political co-operation and to avoid the horrors of war being inflicted on the Continent again.  That idea of Europe is once again a political goal that is at the fore of all our minds as we see war being fought on our Continent and the brutal invasion of Ukraine.  Certainly, for people in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the countries of the Western Balkans, the peace and stability they have seen brought about by the EU are clearly an aspiration for many of them.  We must support them and, in particular, the request by Ukraine that we support its rapid accession to the EU.  The Taoiseach has spoken on that on a number of occasions.  It is also important to note how generously the EU has responded by delivering aid and supplies and, critically, by providing refuge for so many millions of those fleeing their homeland because of the war.  While Ireland is militarily neutral, we should not be politically neutral in the face of this brutal and illegal war.  We have been clear in our role to support Ukrainians fleeing the devastation there and to support the non-military response to the war at European level.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the European response, I wish to speak briefly about collective economic approaches being adopted by the EU.  In the mechanism of the post-Covid recovery fund the EU introduced the concept of collective debt through the issuing of &euro;800 billion worth of joint bonds to fund the recovery.  That was a historical development that could have been learned from the previous response to the economic crash in the late 2000s.  The same mechanism is now being proposed as a way of raising the billions of euro that will be needed to support and fund Ukraine and, when the war ends, to support the rebuilding of that country.  The Labour Party would welcome that plan.  We can see the clear need for collective effort and collective financing for Ukraine, as well as debt relief for Ukraine.  As my colleague, Deputy Howlin, said last year, the European Union reflects the political opinions of member state governments and of directly elected MEPs.  That is why we must campaign, and I am conscious it is a real challenge for our party, to elect left wing and centre left MEPs and progressive governments across the EU to deliver on our political objectives and to ensure that the EU acts with that sense of collective solidarity.<\/p>  <p>  There was great relief across Europe when Marine Le Pen was defeated in France.  To have seen the election go a different way and to have seen a government that was staunchly against the EU and committed to undermining the EU would have been against all our interests.<\/p>  <p>  Social Europe, that collective goal to which the Labour Party and the Party of European Socialists aspire, has delivered rights for workers and women and for greater equality.  It has also delivered on employment rights generally.  The negotiation under way on an EU law for an adequate minimum wage will deliver on a key principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights.  Tomorrow the D&aacute;il will debate the Labour Party's Living Wage Bill 2022.  I have circulated an email to all colleagues about that.  It is one aspect of ensuring there is a rise in people's incomes to meet the terrible cost-of-living crisis that so many are experiencing across the country at present.  We are seeking Government support for that Bill.  It is in line with a commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that the minimum wage becomes a living wage and that there is a mechanism to ensure a pathway to a living wage over three years.  That is the premise of our Bill and we hope to see it passed in the House tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000027#AA00100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1652200800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>When one looks back on the decision by the Irish people 50 years ago in 1972 to join the then European Economic Community one must accept it was a big, brave and forward-looking decision by a country that was still in its infancy and that still had much to do to maximise the opportunity and the benefits of its independence.  Only 50 years before that, the country had come through the War of Independence and the Civil War.  It was still very much inward looking, yet it had this ambition, the ambition of people such as Se&aacute;n Lemass, Jack Lynch, Dr. Patrick Hillery and others, to be part of the international family and to maximise its role in and input into that international family.<\/p>  <p>  It took our membership of the EEC, later the EU, really to enshrine the principles of what it meant to be a republic within our daily lives.  To look at and reflect on the economic progress is easy to do and a relatively lazy argument to make.  The harder thing to do is to look at the other progress.  There is the progress of our education system and the various funding opportunities in education and particularly the ability to grow the regional technical college, RTC, system.  There is the equality agenda, how that has changed inconceivably since 1973 and what had to be done.  One thinks of things such as the marriage bar, which sounds so arcane now and had such an impact on so many people.  That was one of the parts of our accession.  Then there were all the subsequent changes.  We can look back at that decision 50 years ago and be proud of those who took the decision and of those who voted \"Yes\" and took that leap into the place of ambition and looking forward.  Fifty years later, they cannot but be happy with their decision and with what has been achieved.<\/p>  <p>  However, we cannot rest on our laurels either.  Europe Day 2022 comes at a time of enormous challenge.  The foundations on which the EU as it is now was established were to build peace and economic development.  Those foundations are under threat once again, but never in the simultaneous way they are at present.  The war on the Continent of Europe as a result of one country that seeks membership of the Union being attacked by an outside aggressor, is leading to the enormous economic challenges that will be faced over the next weeks, months and years as a consequence.  That citizens of Europe and citizens who seek the protection of the European Union in terms of membership are being attacked in their home states makes this a time for reflection.<\/p> <p>The rather grand ambitions of the Conference on the Future of Europe are important but they have been slightly sidelined.  They need to take on board this situation.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State was in the Chamber in February when I was critical of the response of the EU prior to the invasion of Ukraine.  I have to say that, since then, I have been impressed by its focus and unity, and its determination to maintain that unity in spite of the enormous pressures it faces.  It is vital we maintain this unity during this phase, which will be far trickier in terms of the impact of sanctions and the decisions that have to be taken.  Last week showed the Union can do this.  It can take difficult decisions that will impact on its member states and maintain its unity.  This unity is crucial not only for the people of Ukraine and the Union but also for many other issues.  Once this challenge passes, and it will pass, there will be other challenges.<br\/><br\/>The situation with climate change keeps getting relegated as the priority of the day.  We had Covid and climate change was relegated.  We have Ukraine and climate change has been relegated.  At some stage we will not be able to relegate it.  At some stage the European Union will have to treat climate change in the same way it is treating the situation in Ukraine and how it treated the pandemic.  It will have to treat it with an all-encompassing and, as they say in basketball, an all-court response.  It will have to take the type of decisions on climate change that it is taking now in the context of a war on every citizen of the Union and beyond.  Younger generations who did not have a vote 50 years ago and who were not born 50 years ago expect nothing less.  They have an ambition, particularly those who are much younger, for climate change that is far greater than that expressed by the institutions of the European Union at present.  This in part is a tribute to the successful educational record of the Union, the Erasmus programme and the opportunities the EU has given generation after generation in Ireland to open their imaginations and their minds and see the opportunities.  I commend the Government on continuing to fund the Erasmus programme for people in Northern Ireland.  It is an enormous opportunity.  This needs to be expanded and continued to ensure the dream of membership continues to challenge the minds and views of people.<br\/><br\/>Rule of law issues and the manner in which there was an <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>version to rule of law were the priority this time last year.  Some countries still have this.  Granted they have stepped up to the mark with regard to the challenge in Ukraine.  They have made some extraordinary responses.  If the European Union is true to its values, which Ireland endorsed 50 years ago and has endorsed on many occasions since through referendums, then rule of law issues cannot be let slip.  The standards of membership and the demands of what it is to be a member cannot be allowed to slip.  Unless we do this and continue to keep a focus on it we will undermine these very principles.<br\/><br\/>T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach tar &eacute;is feachtais an-l&aacute;idir go bhfuilimid in ann an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il san Aontas Eorpach.

They include our Commissioners, Members of the European Parliament and civil servants.  The debate can be very lazy on what Ireland has got from its membership.  Ireland has also given a lot.  We have given some of our best in Commissioners, MEPs and taoisigh who have chaired instrumental decisions of the European Council, such as German unity and the new accession states.  The Minister of State knows more than most that we have to reset our relationship.  The relationship of the next 50 years will be very difficult as our nearest neighbour has gone a different path.  The work of former taoisigh, MEPs and Commissioners on building relationships will make this reset a little bit easier but the work has to be continued every day.  I appeal to the Government to double its efforts to encourage Irish people to work in the secretariats, the Parliament and the Commission at senior Civil Service level so we do not lose the opportunities behind the scenes where the levers really get pulled.  We do not have the influence we once had.  We need to work harder and smarter.<br\/><br\/>One hundred years ago this country was on the precipice of a civil war.  It was one of its most inward-looking times.  Those who fought on both sides had huge ambitions for statehood and for where the country would stand.  Fifty years ago we set on the path of maximising this statehood in the Continent of Europe.  Today we can reflect with pride and quite a lot of happiness on our membership.  We cannot be complacent.  When we were complacent, our people gave a message to the political classes in referendums that we cannot treat our membership of Europe as a constant or be complacent about it.  We have to defend it and fight for it every day.  We have to defend our interests every day.  There were times when we were not good at defending our national interest.  We have to make sure we do so.  We can do this while fighting for European interests also.  We should be incredibly proud of the Taoiseach and the Government with regard to how we have responded to Ukraine over recent months as a small state defending the interests of another small state, which should be given fast-track membership of the European Union.  Ultimately, this would be the statement that would endorse our 50 years of membership, whereby fledgling states would get the opportunities we did on this day 50 years ago after a referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000027#AA00200","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652201400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>We are all in agreement that the European Union is one of the greatest peace projects of all time.  We only need to take a very quick run through European history to see the benefits it has brought.  Like a number of others, I was very lucky to be part of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  While it was a privilege, I will be only too delighted not to see the hemicycle in Strasbourg for quite a while.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, that the citizens, especially Irish citizens, have played a huge role in it.  A number of people really stepped up to the mark.  I make the argument that the conference started rather chaotically.  It was constrained by time to suit the French Presidency.  It probably took it a period of time to bed down and find where exactly it was going and how it was going to construct itself.  There were many issues regarding plenary sessions and working groups. At the end of it we know what could be done better.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital for the survival of the European Union that there is consistent and constant engagement with the citizens.  The Conference on the Future of Europe was not sufficiently representative of Irish society never mind of European society.  There has to be a greater level of engagement, particularly with communities and those at the periphery.  If people go through the proposals, they will see some very good ones.  They will also be shocked at some of what is not there.  We dealt with proposals on health.  There were some progressive proposals on people's right to universal healthcare, but there was no mention of the drug addiction issue we have throughout the European Continent.  We know communities here especially are suffering.<\/p> <p> We all know everything changed because of Russia's criminal invasion of Ukraine and we know about the ongoing campaign by Vladimir Putin's regime.  Regarding war crimes, we will only know at the end of this just what the people have had to endure.  It has been necessary for solidarity and European co-operation.<\/p> <p> I have a difficulty in the sense that some citizens probably worried about the likes of Hungary, rule of law issues and almost wanting to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting.  We need to make the argument that unanimity is a necessity, particularly around foreign policy, defence and security issues.  Throughout the pandemic and in dealing with the Ukrainian crisis, we have shown we can co-operate.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, when he said democracy is the best option.  From time to time, there will be difficulties in coming to arrangements but the alternative is we have one guy with a big table making all the decisions.  We have seen how this works out and it is not great for anybody.<\/p> <p> If we are serious about climate change and the environment, and there are many great proposals, we need to deal with the fiscal constraints foisted on us by the EU.  I know we are in especially constrained times but we will have to learn from the pandemic in the sense there is a necessity for the State to do the heavy lifting.  That is a requirement.  I have seen really brilliant proposals around social justice, particularly regarding trade and where climate change crosses social and human rights.  This is a necessity so that Europe does not become a protectionist set-up.  However, there are still significant difficulties.  We need to get to absolute terms in respect of rule of law issues.  We know we are all dealing with significant issues relating to hybrid and cyber issues, difficulties we never looked at previously.  We all look back on recent events and see them through the prism of the changed world.<\/p> <p> The other reality is that accession must be facilitated for countries in the western Balkans and for the likes of Moldova and Ukraine.  We must facilitate them and they need to step up to the mark.  I would put Scottish independence in that equation.  Irish unity needs to be prepared for.  I still think that not only is there a failing at European level, there is a failing here.  In particular, we need to do it following the historic result in the northern elections recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000028#BB00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652202000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>The writer John McGahern once wrote that Ireland was a peculiar place in the sense that it was a 19th century society right up to the mid-1970s and then it almost bypassed the 20th century.  As we are asked to celebrate and reflect upon Europe Day in the national Parliament, that quote above all captures for me the pace of change that occurred in Irish society after we joined the EEC in 1973.  My party, members of my generation and I were proud Europeans.  We are Irish and European.  The EU has its faults and I intend to address those in some detail, but it is important to begin by expressing my belief that the EU on the whole has been a force for good as a driver of economic and societal change in Ireland and, above all else, as a guarantor of peace for the Continent following the global conflicts that predated its existence.  That peace has once more been threatened by violent despotism we all hoped had been consigned to the 20th century.<\/p>  <p>  Membership of the EU has very clearly changed Ireland.  We joined almost 50 years on from achieving independence from the UK and, as we did, I would argue we were a nation struggling for identity.  It was a society upon which social conservatism was forced as a form of jingoistic patriotism.  It was a state that in turn abandoned vital public services in health, education, care and welfare so that citizens were reliant on the Catholic Church to provide what a State ought to provide.  It was an economy that was overly agrarian, protectionist and lacking in confidence.  In December 1972, 84% of the people of this country voted to remove the special place afforded the Catholic Church in our Constitution.  Earlier that year and on this date 50 years ago, almost an identical percentage of our population voted for Ireland to join what was then the EEC.  It would be very wrong to point to that year or indeed to those referenda as the moment when Ireland threw off its cloak of conservatism on social or economic grounds - the various struggles for LGBTQI+ and reproductive rights or even the right to divorce testify to that - but for me, that was an important moment when the Irish people were very clear in their determination to chart a new course and to be outward looking to the point of being part of a collective bigger than ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach touched on this point in his speech when he said that membership gave us the impetus needed to strengthen our human rights record, drive forward civil and social rights, introduce gender equality legislation, improve the protection of workers' rights and become a much more tolerant, kinder and inclusive country than Ireland had been up to that point.  I also wish to highlight the role civil society played in driving that forward but we should not in any way undermine the role of the EU in giving us that confidence.  It is important to note that Ireland in 1972 was a much darker place than it is today.  I think this gives us the legitimacy to point to the type of rule of law issues with which we were dealing in the EU before the invasion of Ukraine.  We should not be afraid to challenge those who do not meet those standards, be they friend or foe.  In particular, I am pointing to the horrific sequence of LGBT exclusion zones that exist in Poland, the exclusion of members of the community and the banning of literature.  All of this is very much prevalent and we should not forget about it nor should we shy away from confronting those and holding them to a standard.  There are rule of law mechanisms to which we need to return and we should apply zero tolerance when discrimination abounds in the EU or even among our friends that wish to join.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to talk about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  It is important to reflect upon the fact that, as missiles rain down on Ukrainian cities, towns and people, one of the calls being made most loudly from Ukraine involves becoming a member of the EU.  It is to our credit and that of the Irish State that we have been most vocal in supporting those calls, but what is to be the legacy of the collective response to this most horrific attack by the forces of Putin on the people of Ukraine?  It has been said that this too will pass.  We need to be there to support the rebuilding of Ukrainian cities and welcome it into the EU, but we also need to look at the factors that contributed to the Russian state being able to engage in this horrendous assault on Ukraine and reflect on how we remove ourselves from dependence on fossil fuel extraction, which has fuelled this war.  We cannot simply say that with these sanctions and our unwillingness to engage with the Russian Federation, we are going to engage with undemocratic regimes elsewhere, be they Saudi Arabia or in South America.  We must remove ourselves from dependence on fossil fuel extraction.<\/p>  <p>  We hear much about the militarisation of the EU and we must oppose it in every single way.  In the case of previous wars, we have seen great increases in industrialisation.  There needs to be a new green impetus where fossil fuel extraction is eliminated.  We need to invest in solar, wind and, if necessary, wave energy.  This will allow us to remove ourselves entirely from dependence on these types of despotic regimes that are funded by this type of fossil fuel extraction.<\/p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of another threat facing the EU.  When we talk about the EU and Ireland's role in it, we are also told that Ireland's membership of the EU has given us access to a market of 440 million people.  The EU must be much more than a market-based economy.  A total of 96.5 million people are living in or are at risk of poverty.  This is a massive threat to the EU.  As evidence of this, I often point to a place just across the water from us, namely, Holyhead in Anglesey in Wales, which I believe is the poorest part of the UK.  As we approach the six-year point of the Brexit referendum, we should remember that this part of the UK, which was totally reliant on exports coming from Ireland to the EU, voted to leave.  The average household income there is just under &euro;14,000.  This town was totally dependent on exports to the EU before the UK left the EU, yet it still voted to leave.  If people do not feel the benefits and warmth of EU membership, they will remove themselves from it.  Poverty is not often discussed in the EU.  I believe we can be leaders in confronting it.<\/p> <p>We can no longer tolerate a situation where anti-poverty strategies are brought forward every five years and simply left on a shelf to rot, because poverty, among other things, is a huge threat to the very foundation of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000029#CC00200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652202600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words to mark Europe Day 2022.  I am conscious of the fact, like other speakers, that overshadowing Europe Day this year is the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  War has returned to Europe.  The European Union, at the outset, was fundamentally a peace project and the Russian invasion makes us reflect again on the aims and objectives of the EU and the values underpinning it.<\/p>  <p>  The year 2022 also marks the 50th anniversary of Ireland joining the EEC, as it was called then, when 83% of the electorate voted Yes on the day.  That is worth commemorating and the Government has put together an EU 50 programme to ensure we do just that and celebrate and commemorate our membership of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to say something about the Conference on the Future of Europe.  The EU is not perfect, far from it, and there is always room for improvement.  At a basic level it needs to be responsive to the needs and aspirations of all its citizens, particularly with regard to its economic policy objectives which should not foster inequality or exclusion.  The final report of the conference, which contains 49 proposals across a wide range of areas, was presented to the EU Presidents yesterday.  The proposals include the abolition of the veto in almost all areas of EU-decision making, that is, replacing the need for unanimity with qualified majority voting.  Also in the report are proposals for greater powers to be given to the European Parliament and for enhanced EU military co-operation.  In summary, the report advocates greater integration, swifter decision-making and a more powerful and proactive EU.  Of course, this raises the prospect of treaty change and Ireland will need to be vigilant and proactive as this process unfolds.  I note that the Taoiseach said earlier in his contribution to this debate that we need \"careful and considered reflection\" on the report.  That was significant.  Already, 13 member states have apparently signed a letter opposing any institutional reforms in the context of this report.  I would suggest the Oireachtas will need to be kept fully briefed on the Government's intentions in respect of the 49 proposals outlined in the final report of the conference as they are further considered by the EU institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to say a few words about EU enlargement.  A number of countries in the western Balkans wish to join the EU, including North Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia, while Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia also want to join.  They have completed their questionnaires and these are being assessed by the European Commission for a further report to a European Council meeting.  As a general principle, Ireland is in favour of enlargement but joining the EU is a complex and often lengthy process.  As the Russian bear eyes these countries up and tries to destabilise them, we need to give them every practical assistance, including financial aid, help to resolve internal conflicts, assistance with governance and public administration issues, help to reduce their energy dependence on Russia and so on.  However, they do need to meet the EU criteria and there can be no backsliding from adherence to European values.<\/p>  <p>  European Movement Ireland has just published another Red C poll to coincide with Europe Day and the 50th anniversary of our EU membership.  The findings of the poll are interesting, with 88% agreeing that Ireland should remain a member of the EU.  This confirms, yet again, Ireland's strong ongoing support for EU membership down through the years.  The Brexit vote in the UK in 2016 has not affected this.  If anything, the opposite is the case.  The Euroscepticism associated with Brexit has not raised its ugly head here, thankfully.  Another finding is that 59% agree Ireland should be part of increased EU defence and security co-operation.  This is significant against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the agreement reached recently on the so-called strategic compass.<\/p>  <p>  There can be no doubt that EU membership has been enormously beneficial for Ireland.  It has brought about peace, prosperity and progress in many ways.  It has transformed Irish society and is responsible for dramatic changes in the economic, social and cultural life of this country.  I think of the changes that have taken place with regard to environmental laws, consumer legislation, and labour law, to name but a few.  The EU is continually adapting to new issues and challenges.  It is at the forefront in tackling climate change.  In recent years it responded to the Covid-19 pandemic by successfully co-ordinating the acquisition of vaccines for its citizens and bringing forward the EU recovery and resilience fund.  Following Brexit, the EU concluded negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and the trade and co-operation agreement and put in place the Brexit adjustment reserve.<\/p>  <p>  At the core of the EU is adherence to liberal democratic values, fundamental human rights, free and fair elections, a free press, ethics in politics and judicial independence.  These are the essence of the European values.  They are always threatened by autocratic regimes so there can be no backsliding from these fundamental principles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000030#DD00200","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1652202600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The 50th anniversary of Ireland's membership of the European Union is a major milestone in our history.

It has been great to grow up in the heart of Europe and so many of us cannot remember a time when Ireland was not part of the European Union.  We have been part of the EU for a generation and have seen what support from our neighbours can mean.  During the Brexit negotiations, EU support meant we were able to retain the common travel area and secure the Northern Ireland protocol.  We may be an island out on our own on the western tip of Europe but we never feel alone because of our close relationships within the EU.  We are simply getting better because we know it is better to work together.  We see this now as moves are being made to dismantle the protocol, but I urge everyone to harness the spirit of Europe and work together to bring about a stable government for Northern Ireland.  As John Hume famously said, the European Union is the best example of conflict resolution in the history of the world.  On a separate note, I congratulate all of candidates who were elected in the assembly elections in Northern Ireland.  It was really good to see so many women standing for election.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen major changes in Ireland in recent years, including Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.

Just five years after the Second World War, it was a remarkable moment, with old enemies seeing that they had more in common than what divided them.  Eventually, they would build a new European Community through a Common Market which we ourselves joined on this very day in 1972, exactly 50 years ago.  I did not have a vote at the time but if I had voted, I would have voted for no other reason than to break the connection with England, to quote another Kildare man from my neck of the woods.  Being members of the European Union has brought many opportunities to us on the island of Ireland, as we build peace and prosperity for all the people who live here.<\/p>  <p>  I said that we are Europeans in our own right but Ireland had a leading role in Europe centuries before the Common Market and the EU.  Columbanus, now considered a patron saint of Europe, set up communities across the Continent in France, Austria and Italy.  One does not have to be religious to see and value the significance of Columbanus in Europe, his unifying spirit for the people and his rescuing of civilisation in the sixth century of the common era.  It is no wonder that Robert Schuman referred to him in his speeches in Europe and no wonder he reminded Europeans of the value and power of the man born in Wexford - or Carlow, as was mentioned a few minutes ago - around the year 540 and who died in Italy.<\/p>  <p>  On this Europe Day, 72 years after Schuman made his declaration, we see war in our Continent and invasion on the borders of our Continent.  Leaving out the conflict in the North and the Balkan genocide, it is the first time we have seen all-out invasion and war in Europe since the Second World War.  There is now a lot of talk about the values of Europe and I believe we need to look closely at them again.  I believe we need to bring the management of our Union closer to the people because the EU cannot be a situation of the rulers and the ruled, with unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats and technocrats deciding the future of peoples from a position of distance.  People must have the confidence and security that they, through their votes and elected representatives, hold the power.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted that Chris MacManus MEP, who replaced Deputy Matt Carthy for the Midlands-North-West constituency, is so often in the constituency of Kildare North, as, indeed, Deputy Carthy was before him.  It is important that MEPs are connected to the people they represent in Europe and Chris MacManus certainly keeps me busy finding people that he wants to meet around north Kildare.<\/p>  <p>  The EU also plays a key role on the Northern Ireland protocol, which is of such significance to people in the Six Counties, who want their children to live in the future and want a good life, prosperity and progress for all.  That the majority of MLAs elected last week are in favour of the protocol is of significant importance to us here.  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the members of my own party, who increased their vote in the North, and to all who had success in the elections.  I offer my commiserations to those who lost their seats.  It is an awful position to be in, particularly if they are working for constituents as that awful feeling that they have let them down can be soul destroying.  It was unfortunate to lose the two Green MLAs but I know that Philip McGuigan in North Antrim will take up that baton.<\/p>  <p>  On the bright side, I have lost count of the number of people who came into my constituency office on Friday and again yesterday, just popping their head around, or who stopped me when I was out and about, because they see this new dawn for our beautiful island.  It is great to see that interest in the Twenty-six Counties at this seismic and historic change that took place in the North.<\/p>  <p>  In the Brexit referendum, the majority who voted in the North chose to remain in the EU and, in the inevitability of a united Ireland, they will realise that voted intention and be fully back in the EU automatically.  That is something we must start preparing for.  We cannot put a citizens&rsquo; assembly on unity on the long finger.  We must be ready for that inevitability, particularly as Europe has worked so hard to support the North during Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Ukraine too is anxious to join a union of peoples.  We have opened our hearts and our homes to the Ukrainians fleeing Putin&rsquo;s war.  I met H.E. Larysa Gerasko yesterday and the pain on her face was palpable.  The value of dignity, freedom, hope and solidarity needs to be recommitted to, especially here in this State as we face our own crisis of homelessness.

I want to make some points about it to the D&aacute;il as they are important.  The Conference on the Future of Europe was made up of various European politicians as well as randomly selected people.  One key recommendation was for the removal of unanimity for foreign affairs and defence issues.  Emmanuel Macron and Ursula von der Leyen supported the opening of a discussion to reform the European Union treaties and have called for the establishment of a convention to discuss that.  This was also backed by the European Parliament and by Mario Draghi last week.  Mr. Macron also spoke of a European political community in parallel to the EU institutions that would be open to non-EU countries, including the UK and Ukraine.  The German European Minister spoke about the possibility of deeper integration of those who are willing.<\/p><p>Mr. Macron, the German Government, the Italian Government, the Commission and so on want either the EU or, if necessary, a subset of EU states to have greater punching power for the inter-imperialist rivalries of the 2020s and 2030s.  They want to have the weight and the flexibility of the United States, China, Russia and so on in defending their geopolitical position and the interests and profits of Europe's big corporations.  At the moment, it is the United States that is calling the shots in regard to the Western intervention on the Ukraine crisis.  The top European leaders want to have greater impact and weight for Europe's capitalist powers.  The removal of national vetoes and replacement with weighted votes on foreign affairs, up to and including military action, will be a big step in this direction.<\/p><p>Where does the Irish Government stand in this debate?  Will the Irish Government support a two-tier Europe and which tier does it want Ireland to be in?  Will the Government support the convening of a convention for a new treaty at the European Council, as this is likely to be on the agenda at the June European Council?  If so, the Government is supporting a move to a more militarised Europe.  I remind the Minister of State that any removal of powers from the Irish State to the European Union, such as a removal of unanimity, will require a referendum.  It is a referendum that the Government could very well lose.<\/p><p>The speeches this week, in my view, exposed the real nature of the European union as a capitalist bloc.

I will not focus, as others may, on unelected bureaucrats or try to find the one or two negatives because we know that the vast majority of Irish people are in favour of our continuing membership of the European Union and recognise that it is has been beneficial for Ireland to be part of the European Union.  The events of recent months and years, including the war in Ukraine, the pandemic and the impacts of Brexit, have really hammered home for many people how important our continuing membership of the EU is for all people.  It is not some capitalist agenda.  It is something for everyone.<\/p><p>As one of the Oireachtas delegates to the Conference on the Future of Europe, I fundamentally believe the recommendations coming out of that should be embraced not just by the European Commission and European parliamentarians, but also by member state governments.  However, I have some concerns in terms of where Irish people may be a little bit concerned.  I know the Minister of State has already read through some of the findings of the wonderful RedC opinion poll, commissioned by European Movement Ireland.  The overall finding - that 88% of Irish people support Ireland's continuing membership of the EU - is of course heartening to see.  However, there is a bit of a worry that needs to be addressed.  The level of support is not as high among females as it is among males; it is 90% among males and 80% among females.  In my own age category, the 36- to 44-year-old group, just 83% of people are in favour.  That needs to be reflected on as the Minister of State continues his work, but also in terms of dealing with EU jobs, communicating Europe and everything else.  The poll also found that 79% of people think EU membership has been beneficial to Ireland.  It is an absolutely wonderful result but there is again a disparity because this view is shared by 85% of males and just 73% of females.  That desperately needs addressing and reflection.  It is very interesting that among the 45- to 54-year-old group, just 71% have that positivity.  These figures are all part of the challenges when we talk about communicating Europe.<\/p><p>It is wonderful that we have these annual speeches about Europe Day.  It is an opportunity to say whatever we want because everything comes back to our role in the EU.  It can be about agriculture, workers' rights, the economy, defence, security or whatever the topic <i>du jour<\/i>is.  Ultimately, every day we talk about our role within the European Union.  In our role as domestic politicians, it is often handy to do what various Ministers from my own party and others have been guilty of in the past, which is to look for the very easy punching bag that is the EU.  If we are bringing in legislation that might not be very popular, we can say it is something that has to be done because of Brussels.  When funding is announced, however, that is said to be an achievement of the Government regardless of what role the European Commission or other member states have played.  We have to reflect on that in our language and sometimes in our desperate search for headlines or indeed criticism for the sake of criticism.  It is okay to be positive, to talk about the good things and to see the Minister of State and many other Ministers travelling to schools throughout the country with ambassadors for Europe Day, for example through the blue star programme or the European Parliament access programme.  It is okay to be positive and to talk about how different things were for my own parents' generation, the generation of the marriage bar, when the thought of going to Spain on a two-week holiday without having to change money was simply foreign.<\/p><p>One of the key issues facing all of Europe is the rule of law.  We talk about the rule-of-law crisis in certain EU member states.  I am happy to name Hungary as being one of them.  We talk about the brutal abuse of international law by the Russian Federation as it invades Ukraine.  Once again, we have to raise our concern that unnamed sources in the British media are saying that the British Government is prepared to break international law and to use domestic legislation to override an international treaty in terms of the protocol.  Neither this Government, anyone in this Parliament nor the European Commission can stand by that.  I urge the Minister of State and his Government colleagues to continue to be strong with European colleagues to face down the British Government in its attempts to override the commitments it made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000032#FF00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1652203800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to congratulate those who were successful in the Assembly elections in Northern Ireland and commiserate with those who lost their seats, including the two Green Party MLAs who served the Assembly very well in the years they were there.

I thank Deputy Cronin of Sinn F&eacute;in for her generous comments a few minutes ago.<\/p>  <p>  Today we mark Europe Day which celebrates peace and unity in Europe.  The 20th century was a century of hostile conflicts but also a century of pursuing peace.  In 1920 the League of Nations was established to promote international co-operation and to achieve peace and security in the wake of the First World War which had left Europe in ruins.  It unfortunately failed for many reasons.  Among those reasons were that multilateralism was a new idea and that the great powers ignored the League of Nations in their efforts to appease the emerging dictator.<\/p>  <p>  What followed was the deadliest military conflict in history.  The Second World War caused unimaginable suffering and destruction.  At the end of it, vast areas of Europe had been obliterated.  In less than a decade approximately 80 million people were killed.  Afterwards, the borders were redrawn, efforts were made to permanently dismantle the war-making abilities of the aggressors and peace agreements were signed.  The most important of those peace agreements was that establishing the United Nations which, like its predecessor the League of Nations, was created with the aim of preventing future wars.  However, with the United Nations only in its infancy and with the growing tensions between western powers and the eastern bloc, the result was the Cold War and the spectre of an unimaginable third world war still loomed real.<\/p>  <p>  The destruction seen in the First and Second World Wars was a catalyst for ideas of strong European co-operation that went beyond the policy of balance of power.  Yesterday marked the anniversary of the historic Schuman Declaration, which set out the idea for a new form of political and economic co-operation in Europe.  The declaration was a proposal to place French and West German production of coal and steel under a single authority with the purpose of making war between historic rivals France and Germany \"not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible\".  We may be moving away from coal but the ownership and control of natural resources still defines the geopolitics of Europe and the world.  We should ask ourselves what peace means.  Peace is not just the opposite of or the absence of war.  It is actually much more than that.  Peace is stability, opportunity and diversity.  It is the opportunity for adventure and meeting people and for a long, enjoyable and healthy life.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday I met with students in Castletroy College in my constituency and I was greeted by Mr. Flanagan, principal, and Ms Gunnigle, politics and society teacher.  We were accompanied by Ms Barkan-Cowdy of the French Embassy.  We learned how the European Commission works and how it interacts with the European Parliament.  It was a very worthwhile session and I commend Ms Barkan-Cowdy on coming to Limerick and the staff of Castletroy College on a very interesting session.  There is an opportunity for those young people now to work overseas throughout Europe.  There is an opportunity for them to work in Brussels and to continue this peace machine; the great effort at peace that has been the European Union of the past 50 years.<\/p>  <p>  We have always been good participants in the European project.  As Deputy Calleary mentioned earlier, we send our best and brightest to Brussels.  Both Brexit and the climate crisis require us to reinforce that connection and to redouble our efforts at building it.  The Green Party was not part of that referendum 50 years ago because it was not founded for another seven years.  The party was born in Germany on the day that I was born.  The Irish Green Party, an Comhaontas Glas, was founded the following year.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset the Green Party established itself as a pan-European party.  Perhaps more than any other, we believe in co-operation throughout Europe.  We believe we cannot solve the great environmental challenges without this level of co-operation.<\/p> <p>In this House, we are perhaps the party that embraces Europe more than any other.  We have a strong network across every member state and we have an ongoing dialogue with our colleagues in every country of the Union and outside it.  For us, nationalism is a vestige of a darker past, and, unlike others, it is a label we do not attach to ourselves.  We have no greater right to a safe and healthy life and a clean environment by virtue of where we are born.  As a party, unlike others, we do not have a Eurosceptic past and we are proud of that.  We believe in the European project and always have.<\/p> <p> I have spoken many times here about Ireland's opportunity in renewable electricity generation.  I am happy that my colleagues across the House are on board and are demanding that it be realised as soon as possible.  It is an opportunity that would not exist except for our connection with Europe.  We will provide clean energy to our neighbours and enlist the help of our neighbours to exploit this resource.  Our connection with Europe will strengthen because of this mutual interdependence and necessary co-operation.  Together, we will help to quit our dependence on fossil fuels from the east and we will build a lasting peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000032#FF00300","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652204400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Yesterday marked 70 years since the Schuman Declaration.  It was a time when states were struggling to rebuild after the brutal destruction of the Second World War.  With the horrors of that war still fresh in the minds of so many, the core of the declaration presented a strong determination to prevent another war.  It aimed to \"make war between the historic rivals [...] 'not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible'\".  This declaration set in place a vision for a new Europe, one with co-operation at its core.  When we look at the aims and values of the EU today, we can see the potential of this community.  It is important to acknowledge and commend the great social advances made across the EU member states in the last 70 years.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, concerned that the EU has drifted dangerously far from its values and aims.  The EU's aims in the wider world are clearly defined.  These include contributing \"to peace, security, the sustainable development of the Earth [...] strict observance of [...] international law\" and to \"solidarity and mutual respect among peoples, free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights [...]\", which of course sounds great.  The reality of the actions of the EU and its member states paints a different picture.  The military-industrial complex in the EU has silently developed into one of the largest in the world, where making profits by EU states has clearly taken precedence over the aims of the EU worldwide.  EU policy on arms trade clearly states that \"Member States are determined to prevent the export of military technology and equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression or contribute to regional instability\".  It has been clearly documented, however, that arms and military equipment produced in Europe and sold outside the EU have been used in brutal war crimes and caused forced displacement and migration.<\/p>  <p>  We only have to look at Saudi Arabia and Israel as prime examples.  The Saudi Arabian Government is one of the biggest clients for European arms, with the EU arms purchased frequently ending up in war-torn regions.  While MEPs voted for an EU-wide arms embargo against Saudi Arabia because of its horrific crimes in Yemen, it was disappointing that the vote did not compel EU member states to act.  It was merely symbolic.  This symbolic act made little or no difference to the thousands of Yemeni men, women and children killed or maimed by weapons supplied by EU member state governments.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised the subject of the crimes of apartheid Israel here on many occasions.  What many of us might not realise, though, are the massive amounts of money being made by EU states when arming Israel.  Between 2015 and 2020, Germany exported more than &euro;1 billion worth of arms to Israel.  Despite countless international human rights groups documenting Israeli war crimes and acts of apartheid, the EU stayed silent while EU member states made large profits selling weapons to these rogue states.  We urgently need the EU to be pulled back onto the track of its original aims and values, namely, peace, justice and the protection of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000033#GG00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1652204400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here to contribute to this historic debate.  I recognise the significance it holds for the peoples of Europe as it marks Europe Day yesterday.  I also recognise the special significance it holds for the people of this country, because 50 years ago today, exactly, on 10 May 1972, our parents' generation voted to join what was then the European Economic Community, EEC.  The rest, as they say, is history.  I do not think either the Minister of State or myself were around at the time of the referendum, but I certainly recall the 1980s.  I remember the poverty, the mass unemployment, the mass emigration, the social repression and the armed conflict that blighted this country for decades.  When I compare today's Ireland with that of the 1980s, they may be the same country, but they are utterly different worlds and almost exclusively for the better.<\/p>  <p>  That has not happened by chance.  There is a reason the great majority of Irish people, 88%, are in favour of EU membership and why so many countries in the world wish to join the Union.  The reason is that the European project is a success.  It is not a complete and utter success, but it is a success nonetheless.  It is important that we reflect on why this is the case.  First, all 27 EU countries are at peace, with themselves and with their neighbours.  This has not occurred by chance.  There is also much more tolerance now and many more forums for the peaceful settlement of disputes, be those economic, diplomatic or political.  Not a single EU country has been at war since the foundation of the EU and that is an achievement in itself.  I am only a humble soldier, but even I know the best way to destroy your enemies is to make them your friends.  The EU is a classic living and breathing example of that principle.  All we have to do is to look over the wire or the wall to the east of Poland and we can see the alternative.  A war of conquest is going on there, and that was the norm only 80 years ago.  We should never take the peace on this Continent for granted as a result.<\/p>  <p>  I also agree with Deputy Calleary regarding his focus on education, which has been the second major impact and legacy of the EU on this country.  We have all been beneficiaries of it.  I refer to the moneys from the Structural Fund that built our schools, at primary and second level, as well as the research grants and other funding that financed research in our third level institutions.  Deputy Calleary was also correct in pointing out the importance of the Erasmus+ flagship programme.  I am also happy to see that being extended to encompass people in Northern Ireland.  Equally, through L&eacute;argas, this programme is now available not only to those in third level institutions but also to adult learners and to secondary and primary school students.  This is greatly important, because not every lesson can be taught effectively.  Some can only be experienced.  Travelling around Europe, one experiences the different cultures, different understandings of tolerance and different ideas and visions, and it is important to bring those ideas back home.  I am greatly in favour of the Erasmus programme and I encourage everybody listening to this debate to seriously consider participating in it, if they have not done so already.  <\/p>  <p>  Third, the EU's support in the context of Brexit was exemplary.  We had 26 other countries in our corner.  Many of them had absolutely no skin in the game.  It was largely irrelevant to them what happened in Brexit, but they backed Ireland completely and we should never forget that.  Even if we compare the posture of the two negotiating teams, we had one side which was consistent, constructive and courteous, while the other side was reckless and cavalier in its approach.  I am extremely glad that all the members of the EU, each of the other 26 members, were entirely on side in that perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is of course not perfect.  It was never intended to be.  It was always meant to be a work in progress.  I suspect the Minister of State has heard the phrase about the United Nations that is applicable to the EU as well: \"The UN was [never designed to bring] us to heaven, but to save [us] from hell\".  It is apposite to assign that phrase to the EU as well.  The Union is imperfect.  It has its faults and failings.  When we reflect on the last 50 years, though, we should also focus on the next 50 years.  In that context, perhaps, the next 50 days are all important.  The number one focus of the EU now is to bring about a peaceful settlement to the situation in Ukraine.  The Ukrainian crisis is rapidly becoming a Russian crisis.  We must use every lever at our disposal in this context, whether military, economic, diplomatic or political.  We must use carrots and sticks.  There is a lot more stick than carrot now, but I share the concerns mentioned by President Biden today regarding President Putin not having an off-ramp.  <\/p> <p>He does not have an exit strategy.  He does not have a ladder to climb down.  It is very important that the EU, while it is using the stick, also uses a small bit of carrot and says that if a ceasefire is declared, unilateral or otherwise, and Russian troops withdraw from Ukraine, there are positive steps that are going to happen.  We have to remember we are not just talking about Putin any more.  We are talking to his potential successor.  That is what we have to keep in mind.<\/p> <p> Moving beyond that, in respect of the fifth day horizon, I am in favour of more countries joining the European Union, particularly those in the Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova and the tiny Republic of Georgia, which should not be forgotten.  They are very keen to get in for the same reasons we were and to achieve the same benefits we achieved.<\/p> <p> On the need to tackle the climate crisis, which has not gone away, this new-found cohesion and sense of belonging and togetherness that the European Union has found over the last few months needs to be applied also to the climate crisis.  We need more funding for the retrofitting programme, to support the purchase of electric vehicles and to ensure that we move to a renewable future from a climate point of view and an energy security point of view.<\/p> <p> The European Union is not some stuffy office in Brussels, Frankfurt or Strasbourg.  We are the European Union.  If there is a problem with the European Union there is a problem with us.  We have to engage more and recognise that we can influence and shape the direction of the European Union.  I will leave my last word to our parents' generation.  I am very grateful for their wisdom and vision 50 years ago today, when they recognised the opportunity and potential of the European Economic Community as it was at the time.  They passed on the greatest gift they possibly could by making our lives much better than their own.  Whether they passed on their vision or their wisdom is for other people to decide and is perhaps a question for the next generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000033#GG00300","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652205000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Alan Farrell.  I am very pleased to be here to mark 50 years of Ireland's membership of the European Union.  It will be for others today to balance whether that was a broadly positive or negative move in their view.  In my view it has been overwhelmingly positive.  It unlocked the potential of a State that was emerging from oppression under an empire and happened under a generation who had fought for that freedom.  They were so far-seeing in their open approach to nationalism that they wanted to share and pool their sovereignty across the Continent.  They believed that was the best way for Ireland to protect itself and to have its place among the nations.<\/p>  <p>  I am very proud of the part that Fianna F&aacute;il played in leading us into Europe.  Many of those who fought in 1916 went on to found our party but we do not believe that any one item of history is owned by any one political party.  I saw a row yesterday on Twitter between different Members of this House and journalists about who voted for and against accession.  There were people who campaigned against it and had fears about the European Union but rather than taking glory in that, I would say that I am happy that their fears did not come to fruition.  They did not.  Many of the concerns people had were addressed by our membership of the European Union.  I refer to better pay for women, better opportunities for younger people and better access to services right across Europe.  For all of those things, today is an important day.<\/p>  <p>  It is also a day to reflect on what the European Union means to each of us, \"my European Union\" as Deputy Berry said.  I just listened to a podcast series called \"Revolutions\" by Mike Duncan.  It traces the history of revolutions across Europe and how democracy took a foothold.  Inevitably, halfway through each revolution, the country involved ended up going to war with another European country.  All of the striving for progress to make people's lives better in that country or city was stymied by the impact of war.  It is the great peace process.  The absence of the commonality of the European Union in the North, I believe, is a significant factor playing into some of the divisions.  We know that when nationalisms rub up against each other it creates friction and that is what is happening with a more overt form of British nationalism through Brexit.  It does not come at no cost.  When its nationalism rubs up against the sovereignty of other countries it creates friction.  We know that the European Union is one place where such friction is reduced and in many cases, competing nationalism is eliminated.<\/p>  <p>  Europe is worth having as something to inspire us.  Europe needs to protect that inspiration and protect itself as well.  It needs to do that by making its citizens' lives better.  One of the places where Europe fails to do that is in our urban centres.  We have regional economic balance within Ireland but there are pockets of disadvantage in every city of Europe, where the right wing and populist nationalism are exploiting some of the real concerns and problems in those communities and saying that popular nationalism is one of the ways to solve them.  We in this House know that popular nationalism has led us down culs-de-sac before and does not deliver solutions.  This country is largely exempt from a rise of the populist right but we will not always be.  One of the ways in which we stopped the populist right from exploiting problems in places like inner cities where there is urban disadvantage is by having instruments that go in there and solve those problems.  Europe does not do enough to tackle disadvantage.  It does a lot to tackle regional imbalance but not enough to tackle urban disadvantage.  We need to do more.<\/p>  <p>  Europe is something worth protecting and worth fighting for.  We can look at what we have in Europe, the openness, the tolerance, the belief in each other, the belief that we can live in an open and tolerant society.  There are many places in the world where that does not exist.  There will be times when we will need to fight for that, both diplomatically and, perhaps, on occasions when we are attacked, militarily.  Europe is and continues to be something worth protecting and fighting for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000034#HH00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1652205000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>It is 72 years since work first began on building a closer, more peaceful, more successful European Continent.  The aftermath of two world wars left deep scars across Europe and fostered a resolve never again to repeat the failures of the past.  It is also 50 years since 83% of the Irish people supported joining that Union and began a journey of transformation and development.  Accession did indeed unlock the potential of our nation.  As Deputy McAuliffe mentioned, it also freed us from the oppression of an empire.  It also exposed us to multilateralism and different concepts and economic models which removed the oppression of an economic ideology that was very firmly in this State at that time and from which we had only recently emerged.<\/p>  <p>  According to a recent RedC poll, a very encouraging 88% support our EU membership in this State.  Today, we live in a different world from that of our parents and grandparents.  The advent of the internet, globalisation, cultural integration and mass media are just some of the significant changes that have taken place since the beginning of the European project.<\/p>  <p>  However, despite the best efforts of peace-loving Europeans across the Continent, we mark this Europe Day in the shadow of the dark cloud of tyranny and violence.  Russia&rsquo;s attack, its war of aggression against the Ukrainian people, is an assault on the ideals of the European Union and every civilised person who wished to see war in Europe consigned to the ash-heap of history.<\/p>  <p>  During Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, we have seen radical change and enhancements to our own society that would simply not have been possible without our membership of the Union and the assistance of our allies.  In a world based on ever-increasing interconnectivity, we chose to reach out to the people of Europe and to the world.  We did not close ourselves off from the outside world or seek to better ourselves through the denigration of others.  In that sense, we cannot turn away from events in Ukraine, nor can we pretend that the world or our Union will ever be the same following this invasion of territorial sovereignty.<\/p> <p>Will more invasions follow?  Will Georgia, Moldova and perhaps even Finland be subject to Russian aggression?<\/p> <p> It is appropriate, on the basis of what I have said, that on this Europe Day we acknowledge that we stand at a crossroads.  The decisions we make today and in the near future with respect to the security of Ireland and the rest of the Union, self-defence, climate action and energy security, to name but some, will shape how our global society moves forward and how our Union builds on hard-won progress and rejects the narrow nationalism and populism of some on the international stage.<\/p> <p> Ireland and its people have long looked to the future with hope.  It is that spirit that has sustained us through our darkest chapters and given us the strength to overcome our biggest challenges.  Our history demands that we continue to be a voice for hope in the world and share our knowledge and passion for growth, togetherness and ambition with the world.<\/p> <p> We can still turn the tide on the rising aggression and nationalism around the world.  We can limit the worst effects of climate change by working together.  As Deputy Berry pointed out quite rightly, the example that has been shown recently through our response to the energy crisis can and should be replicated when dealing with climate action.  We can build a sustainable, more equal society at home and abroad in the years ahead; however, to achieve this, every European must act.<\/p> <p> It is perhaps the irony of our time that the chipping away of freedoms and truth reveals itself when the situation becomes critical.  Therefore, we as European citizens have a duty of care to democracies and, most important, the truth.<\/p> <p> The EU has been the most successful peace process in the history of mankind.  It has brought progress, abundance and, most important, peace that preceding generations could only dream of.  We cannot take our success for granted, however.  Peace and stability require continual work and attention.  In an hour such as this, with uncertainty regarding what the future holds in nations across Europe and the rest of the world, we must redouble our efforts to ensure the future is hopeful and sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000034#HH00300","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652205600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>A new chapter of recovery and prosperity was expected after Covid in Europe.  The inflationary pressure caused by the European Central Bank&rsquo;s money-printing over the past two years, the policy move towards eliminating fossil fuels without first having alternatives in place and Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine have put paid to that.  Spain recently approved an emergency package to mitigate the economic and social consequences of the Ukraine war, mobilising &euro;16 billion in public funds, including &euro;6 billion in direct support and tax reductions.  Here in Ireland, the supports being offered are weak, patchy and completely insufficient.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are allowing the Green Party to dictate their senseless green policies, which are damaging the economy and crippling families.  These policies are now the leading cause of inflationary pressure in Ireland.  The refusal to slash energy taxes and scrap the carbon tax means that Irish consumers are being fleeced by Government-induced energy taxes in the middle of an energy crisis.  It is cold and calculated that the Government continues to refuse to address this issue, which has now become the elephant in the room.  My colleagues and I tabled a motion two weeks ago to axe the carbon tax.  The Government pursued it full on, imposing more pain on the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  All over the country, we are discussing rising energy costs, which are having a major impact on Irish agriculture and the agri-food sector.  The price of fertiliser alone is up 300%.  The Government, in response, announced a paltry sum that makes no difference to the ordinary farmer.  We have a Minister responsible for the marine who gave away 25% of our pelagic quota.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority above in Killybegs is sending what fish we have to make fishmeal.  What is happening?  Where is Europe intervening in this?  Our Government cannot intervene; it cannot do anything for us.<\/p>  <p>  We should consider how the funds we get from the EU are spent.  Last week, there was an announcement of funding for piers from the Brexit funds.  While many piers around Donegal got millions of euro, why did Keelbeg Pier, Union Hall, get nothing?  The council has announced the closure of part of that pier because there is no funding.  It desperately needs funding from the EU as a consequence.  I am totally opposed to the announcement by the council to close part of the pier.  It is a disgrace that the people of Union Hall were forgotten by the Government in last week's announcements of funds.  This needs to be addressed immediately.  Funding needs to be got in Europe and brought home for the pier urgently.  Even more shocking, despite the fact that the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policies, visited the pier in 2021, it got zero.  I am sorry that I was not there on the day for the people of Union Hall because I would certainly have forced the Taoiseach to announce some funding for the pier.

The continually rising costs of fertiliser, fuel and foodstuffs are affecting every family and farm across the country.  What industry in the world other than the agriculture industry would be told, on the one hand, to increase animal numbers in 2011 and then, on the other hand, to cull animals?  What other industry in the world would be told to cut its supply?  Guess what: our grass production has reduced by 5% and our cattle number is down by 3.3%.  These are all Teagasc-backed figures.  The European Green Deal has set our agriculture sector in a spin.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure whether I can celebrate Europe Day when I know in my heart and soul that the Green Party has jumped on board in enforcing green policy that will damage our economy, driving inflation upwards when we have no alternative.  Inflation is currently at a high of 6.9%, a high that was not seen in 40 years.  Where will the factories get their supplies from?  The supply chain is broken.  I do not think I will celebrate Europe Day.  It is more like \"Mayday, Mayday\", which signals distress &mdash; distress for our farmers caused by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000035#JJ00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1652205600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I remember helping as a buachaill &oacute;g - I was 13 at the time - the enthusiastic Fianna F&aacute;il team that was pushing to join the EU.

It is hard to believe that 50 years have gone by since we signed up to what was the European Economic Community, and 72 years since the Schuman Declaration.  It is hard to imagine that.  I thank the other Members for their written speeches.  I note what the Taoiseach said: \"those convinced that Ireland's future lay in Europe showed the courage to imagine a new Ireland\".  After 50 years, we are at the point where we need the courage to imagine a new Europe, because the Europe that was set up for peace has not happened.  I am aware that the Minister of State disagrees with me.  I will come to the figures, which are absolutely astronomical.<\/p> <p>I referred to them last week in the D&aacute;il and I will repeat what is being spent on military that we know about.  At some stage, rather than the Minister of State just shaking his head, he will have to deal with these facts.  I am a committed European.  I campaigned against the Lisbon treaty because of the militarisation of Europe, which was clearly set out, and the freeing up of the neoliberal agenda that has commodified everything.<br\/><br\/>I say that, while at the same time saying that I am a committed European.  I spent a substantial period of time in Europe, as did my family.  This is not a simplistic thing.  I understand that under Article 9 or 10, decisions in the EU will be made as close as possible to those on the ground.  That has never happened.  We have come to a point where it is Europe Day, but we should have a planet day because we are facing an existential threat in regard to climate change and neoliberalism, which Chomsky referred to as neither new nor liberal.  It is a commodification of every service that we know.  There is a price on everything, but a value on absolutely nothing.<br\/><br\/>While the EU ostensibly and theoretically started out on a good foot to prevent war after the horrible Second World War, it went off in a different direction gradually over the years.  More cynical people would say it was there from the beginning.  I would like to take a more benign view that it happened gradually and became more and more of a military force.  I will again repeat for the record why I say that.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State might note a report I referred to last week,<b><\/b>At what cost? Funding the EU&rsquo;s security, defence, and border policies, 2021&ndash;2027, from StateWatch, regarding transnational justice.  The Minister might look at that.  The Ceann Comhairle happened to be in the Chair when I quoted the figures last week.  They are so astronomical that I doubted them.  The EU increased security, defence and military budgets between 2012 and 2027 by 123%, compared with the last budget round of &euro;19.7 billion.  EU funding of law enforcement, border control and military research is 31 times higher, at &euro;43.9 billion, than the funding for rights, values and justice, at &euro;1.4 billion.  The largest increase is the European Defence Fund, which has a budget of nearly &euro;8 billion.  Again, I doubted this figure and went back and checked it.  It increased by 1,256%.  This money will, for the first time, be used for the research and development of high-tech military weapons.  What I said last week is on the record.  The biggest figure is for the EU border agency, Frontex, which jumped by 200% in less than 20 years.  I did not believe these figures.  I know this debate is not interactive.  I wish it was.  There is no doubt that, at every level, no matter what criteria we use, we are moving closer and closer to a militarised Europe.<br\/><br\/>We are also moving closer to a consensus-type mentality when we know in Ireland the damage that does.  We need the courage to stand up and show a different way.  That is why we got a seat on the Security Council.<br\/><br\/>Lately, two men showed tremendous courage and I want to compliment them.  I did not get a chance to do so on the last occasion.  I understand they are in their 80s and 90s.  They took direct action in Shannon and a jury found them not guilty on two of the charges and fined them on another charge.  The two men, Tarak Kauff and Ken Mayers, are members of an anti-war group, Veterans for Peace.  I want to put their names on the record because they are veterans of Vietnam.  They took courage into their hands because they want to draw attention to what is happening in Shannon, which millions of American soldiers are passing through on their way to war.  I do not know how long we have used this language in the D&aacute;il.  I have been using it, along with my colleagues, and I was only elected in February 2016.  We are constantly told to bring the evidence to the House if we think there is something on the planes.  Of course, we cannot do that.  These men took courage in their hands and tried to do what was right.<br\/><br\/>I refer to EU policy regarding Frontex and building up the borders, and the amount of money that has been spent on that.  We distinguish between different types of refugees.  All war is horrible.  I am on record as having utterly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but it is my duty to question what we are doing as a country with our policy of neutrality.  I am sorry if the Minister of State is getting restless, if his body language is anything to go by.  At what point will we bring some honesty to our discussion on where Europe is going?  At what point will we bring some clarity on what we are spending on the military-industrial complex?  As has been mentioned, arms are going to Saudi Arabia to slaughter people in Yemen.  When will we have honesty about our attitude to Israel and the fact we are ignoring the report from Amnesty International that stated it is operating an apartheid regime?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000035#JJ00500","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652206200,"counter":301,"content":"<p>We have had some interesting contributions, but to be honest, at some points this debate has been a fact-free zone.  I refer to Deputy Michael Collins and funding for piers in Cork this year from the European Brexit adjustment fund.  He came in and made a point that a pier was not funded, when only a few weeks ago the most money ever was given to piers in Ireland, including Cork and his constituency, from the Brexit adjustment fund.  It is a major victory for the Government, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and our membership of the European Union and it shows solidarity.  I do not know whether the Deputy deliberately came in to complain or refuses to acknowledge that 14 out of 15 projects in Cork, as I understand it, were approved, including millions for Kinsale in his constituency, all the way down to Glengarriff and many other piers in between.  There has been huge funding from Europe.<\/p><p>We have had a lot of talk about the European Union's alleged militarisation.  The European Union budget for defence is probably around the same as what we spend on defence in the country.  The European Union does not pay soldiers or send people into battle.  When we talk about the military-industrial complex, I do not deny that can or does exist, but it exists within member states of the European Union.  Quite frankly, if the European Union was in charge of it, we would spend a lot less money and would be far more subject to the human rights considerations that Deputies Connolly and Andrews spoke about.  That is the reality.  That is not where we are going.  We are not involved in common defence.  We cannot do that under our Constitution and it is not going to happen.<\/p><p>I cannot understand the criticism of Frontex.  We are not part of it.  Is Deputy Connolly proposing that we abolish our border control and do not have passport control at Dublin Airport?  Is she suggesting that countries cannot have border control and decide to do it together through Frontex?  There is no conspiracy theory; it is exactly the same as passport control at Dublin Airport.  Let us have a bit of honesty about this instead of coming in here with all of the conspiracy theories.<\/p><p>I am delighted to see the Opposition now suddenly in favour of the European Union.  We have had at least eight or nine referendums on European Union membership.  Sinn F&eacute;in is always against them.  In fact, when we first joined the European Union we were told by Sinn F&eacute;in that it was a sell-out.  It was not a sell-out.  Sinn F&eacute;in was wrong then.  I am very proud of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  Sinn F&eacute;in denigrates our years in government, but the big decisions we made were the right decisions.  We are one of only two parties which campaigned for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in that referendum and I am glad we did so.<\/p><p>Regarding the application for funding from Next Generation EU, which Deputy Brady spoke about, we are fully on schedule with our application for funding out of that.  As I have outlined, we have already drawn down Brexit funding.<\/p><p>Regarding the example Deputy Brady gave about Italy and Deputy Michael Collins's reference to what Spain spent on cost-of-living measures, we have spent more <i>per capita<\/i>than those countries have.  Deputies would want to start looking at their calculations before coming in and complaining about what the Government is or is not doing.  The Government has done a significant amount in regard to the cost of living.  We are expecting another package from the European Union in the next couple of weeks, which will set out views on how to deal with the energy market and reduce prices for consumers.<\/p><p>We can simplify all of these things all we like, but democracy, as I said, is complex.  It is never perfect but dialogue, working together, having disagreements and getting our facts right are important.<\/p> <p> I was happy to meet many students from County Meath yesterday for celebrations to mark Europe Day.  I am relieved that when they study civil, social and political education, CSPE, and history in school, they are getting accurate information from their teachers that will allow them to challenge much of the misinformation in respect of the European Union that wafts through social media and parliaments right across the European Union.  At a time when cynicism - we have seen it in the D&aacute;il today - can often penetrate the consciousness of society, a panacea for this cynicism is the passion and enthusiasm that so many young people from across the country showed towards the European Union yesterday, on Europe Day.  In fact, it was the number one trending item on social media yesterday and for a large part of today.  This year has been officially designated the European Year of Youth.  Young people have never had such opportunities.  Indeed, the young people of Ireland before 1972 did not have the opportunities that there are today.  As we mark Europe Day and the celebrations to mark 50 years since Ireland signed the accession treaty, let us act with renewed vigour in working towards a more perfect Union that all citizens, young and old, can enjoy and benefit from.<\/p> <p> We also need to remember that the scare stories at every referendum - that we were all going to be conscripted, that Europe was going to sell us out and that there were going to be no farmers left - have all been completely wrong.  I was surprised to hear criticism from Deputy Martin Kenny, who is a very thoughtful Deputy, of the European Union's approach to rural and less-populated areas.  He did make that criticism.  I could not believe it when he said that because the truth is that the big debate on and criticism of the European Union in the past decades has been the amount of money it has spent on agriculture and rural development.  At various points, more than 80% of the budget was spent on agriculture, and that includes the LEADER programme.  Other funds were spent on the PEACE programme and continue to be spent on it.  I estimate that at least &euro;40 billion, and probably significantly more, has come into rural areas of this country through the European Union since we joined.  To say that the European Union is not involved in rural or less populated areas is the opposite of the truth.  In fact, Deputy McAuliffe, in criticising the EU's possible non-involvement in urban areas, made the point that the EU has been known to be heavily involved in rural and less isolated areas.  These are places that, frankly, the Rural Independents represent.  They really need to get with the programme on behalf of their constituents.  The best interests of their constituents in rural Ireland have always been served by being part of the European Union, engaging with it and taking opportunities from it.  The scaremongering to which I referred has always been wrong and disproven.<\/p> <p> The European Union has been the greatest vehicle for peace in the history of the world.  It has no interest in war.  It is always trying to prevent wars.  It tries to make peace - to force peace - and to uphold democracy and the right of Deputies such as Deputy Connolly to criticise.  She would not be able to do so in many countries outside the European Union.  Indeed, that right has been threatened within the European Union.  We must protect and value these freedoms.  We must engage in the debate but not scaremonger.  We must not throw around fake news, as regularly happens across this Continent in respect of the European Union, but recognise it for what it is.<\/p> <p> The European Union is a complex democracy.  Laws are passed by elected MEPs and elected governments on behalf of the people.  Almost everything the European Union has been doing through many years has been in the best interests of the people of Europe.  Almost all the equality legislation enacted by the D&aacute;il originally came from European directives.  It works the other way as well, however.  When Ireland became the first country in the world to have a referendum to allow same-sex marriage, other countries followed us.  The European street, as the President of Ireland refers to it, is not a one-way street.  We have benefited from the European Union and been inspired by it, but other European countries have benefited and been inspired by our actions at various times.  Nobody is perfect but the structure that in place has proven time and again to be in the best interests of the people of Europe.  If we do not like the people who are in those structures, we can just vote for different people but maintain the structures.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; m&eacute; br&oacute;d&uacute;il freisin go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il.

Every time that party has been in government in recent times, house prices have risen and homeownership has fallen dramatically.  On the previous occasion the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was in Cabinet, at the tail end of that period, when the current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, was a new backbencher, not only did house prices rise to their highest point in the history of the State, but homeownership fell at a more dramatic pace than ever before or since.  Now Fianna F&aacute;il is back in government and in charge of housing and we are back to the bad old days.<\/p><p>According to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in a month or two we will hit and pass the Celtic tiger peak for house prices.  Again, thanks to Fianna F&aacute;il, homeownership is a distant reality for far too many people.  The reason for that, of course, is the policies the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has introduced.  I will consider some of them before I speak to the motion.<\/p><p>One of his first acts as Minister with responsibility for housing was to expand the highly controversial so-called help-to-buy scheme.  Some 60% of the people who benefited from that scheme did not need it.  They had deposits and mortgages, according to an independent Oireachtas report, and large numbers of organisations and independent economists stated that the scheme would push up house prices  Next we had the shared equity loan scheme.  It has been mired in controversy for almost two years now because of strong opposition from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank.  Even the International Monetary Fund, IMF, last week criticised the potential risk of the scheme.  What will it do?  It will again push up house prices.<\/p><p>Not being satisfied with all of that, the Minister today introduced what has to be the craziest housing scheme I have heard from any Government in recent years.  He is going to give large private developers subsidies of up to &euro;120,000 in Dublin and up to &euro;144,000 outside Dublin, with no reduction in price for the purchaser and no affordability dividend.  It is a chronic waste of taxpayers' money.  At best, it will lock in unaffordable excessive prices for apartments or, at worst, drive them even further upwards.<\/p><p>These are the reasons the latest CSO figures show house prices rising by 15% across the State and by 27% in Border areas.  The median house price across the State is &euro;282,000 but in the Minister's constituency the median price for a new house is almost &euro;500,000.  That is what you get when Fianna F&aacute;il is in government.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister will claim that his affordable housing fund, funding for local authorities to deliver genuinely affordable homes, is another measure to tackle the problems Sinn F&eacute;in is raising tonight.  However, as the figures he gave me in response to a parliamentary question last week, which we published this week, show, that stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of millions Fianna F&aacute;il gives to large developers.  On average, we will get 1,500 units a year through that fund, although it will be two or three years before we get there.  The annual targets for affordable purchase homes through the scheme are appallingly low, with only 400 such homes in Dublin city, fewer than 200 in the Minister's constituency, 30 to 45 a year in the commuter belt and as few as 15 in some cities.  Is it any wonder that people cannot put an affordable roof over their heads? <\/p><p>There is a better way, however.  The motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, building on the costed alternative proposals in our alternative budget, shows how it can be done.  The Government needs to stop giving huge gifts to large developers and speculators and invest all of that money in the direct delivery of large volumes of genuinely affordable homes to purchase through local authorities, approved housing bodies, co-operatives such as &Oacute; Cualann and community housing trusts.<\/p> <p>We estimate that at least 4,000 genuinely affordable purchase homes, built on public land, are needed each year.  As the Minister knows, our innovative leasehold proposal would ensure not only that the homes are genuinely affordable but that, in addition, we would build up, year on year, a growing number of privately owned and privately tradeable but permanently affordable homes, not just for the first purchaser but for every purchaser into the future.<\/p> <p> We also think the Minister should scrap all the crazy schemes that he claims assist people in buying homes, when, in fact, there are no entry level criteria, people get access to public money who do not need it and this drives up the price of public housing.  All of that money could be used to deliver the 4,000 genuinely affordable homes a year for which we are calling.<\/p> <p> Every single local authority should be able to apply for the scheme.  The affordability test through the housing needs demand assessment was badly designed and the Minister has made some concessions in that regard.  The key point is that the one thing the Government can control is the amount of its investment on State land to develop genuinely affordable homes.  The Government is not doing that and it is not in the Minister's plan.  Until he reverses that, the affordable housing crisis is going to get worse.  On that basis, I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000037#LL00300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652207400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>We are once again in this Chamber debating affordable housing and the desperate need to deliver it.  Cork City Council has been beating its targets in this regard for years.  In fact, it exceeds them in many years.  Right now, the council has been given a target of delivering 278 affordable houses and those homes are in the pipeline to be delivered.  The problem is that the targets are too small and not ambitious enough.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has set out a target of 4,000 homes a year, which would equate to a target of 400 a year for Cork City Council, or 10% of the social housing stock in the city.  This would turn out at a total of 1,600 homes.  The difference between the Minister's plan for 278 homes a year and our plan for 1,600 reflects the fundamental difference between us in that the Government is not ambitious enough and does not understand what needs to be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's figures are just a drop in the ocean.  My fear is that the Government is so out of touch and so misled in its priorities that the housing crisis will continue to get worse.  In my maiden speech in Cork City Council in 2009, I said that we had a housing crisis.  Thirteen years later, the crisis is worse now than it ever was.  That has happened under the watch of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Instead of falsely accusing Sinn F&eacute;in of objecting to housing provision, which he does at virtually every opportunity he gets, the Minister would be better off looking at why a person appointed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la continued to vote for housing developments even after the Minister appointed a senior counsel to investigate serious allegations relating to conflicts of interest at the board.  Why do certain people in high positions, who are friends with Ministers and who earn more than the Taoiseach, feel they are above the law and above the Government?<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that the priorities are all wrong.

At this time of the evening, people my age are going home after a long, hard day's work, commuting long distances after what probably was a tough working day.  What are they going home to?  They are going home to overcrowded, cramped living situations or to their parents' box room.  They are trying to scrimp and save as much as they can in order to be able, at some point, to own their own home.<\/p>  <p>  What is the Minister saying to people like that in Galway city and county?  He is saying he will deliver 30 affordable homes in the city each year and 45 in the county.  That is nothing for the people who are waiting for a home and who have been trying, year in and year out, to save the money to be able to get a mortgage.  It does nothing for them.  Something I have seen time after time from the Government parties and their spokespeople and elected representatives in Galway is that they tell us a brilliant development is coming on board to deliver affordable housing in Galway city.  Week after week, people there contact me to ask when that provision will be delivered in order that they can have a chance to own their own home.  Only this week, I found out that the promised housing will not be available until 2024.  That is two years away.  For people who cannot afford their rent and those who have had to move back in with their parents or grandparents, this is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  We know what is needed.  We know there must be more supply.  However, when we do see supply coming onboard in Galway, what we see is build-to-rent provision that is completely unaffordable for people who are working day in and day out.  We need 4,000 homes a year to be delivered, as my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, said, and we need them at affordable prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000038#MM00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1652207400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Taca&iacute;m leis an moladh &oacute;n Teachta &Oacute; Broin.

They are working, some of them in well-paid jobs, but it is just not possible to afford a home.  They cannot afford to rent or buy and they definitely cannot afford to do both.  Homeownership is absolutely out of reach and many of them do not qualify for social housing.  More and more, their future seems uncertain and insecure.  It seems impossible to plan for family, work or anything like that because they do not have any confidence in having a secure home.  They feel their future is being taken away from them.  That is the attitude I encounter in the people I talk to in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  In many respects, things are getting worse.  House prices have increased by 30% since 2016 and rents by 44%.  Cork city has the third highest rents in the State, averaging at more than &euro;1,300 and rising.  Many people would say that is not too bad, given some of the rents one sees in the city, of &euro;1,400, &euro;1,500 and much higher, for relatively modest homes.  The Government has not shown adequate ambition to make housing affordable.  It is failing ordinary workers and families in Cork and across the State.  The targets it has set out are not anywhere near what is needed in terms of affordable housing.  There is provision for 76 affordable homes a year in the city and 38 in the county.  The county council covers a population of approximately 440,000.  Are we expecting it to do the miracle of the loaves and fishes with 38 houses?  It simply will not be anywhere near enough to meet the needs of the number of people being knocked off the housing list, not qualifying for it or not being able to get an affordable mortgage.  It will go nowhere near far enough and those young people will continue to fear for their future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000038#MM00400","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1652207400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Not a single affordable house will be provided over the next four years in counties Monaghan and Cavan, which I represent.

Some might say that at least there finally is a housing target the Government will meet.  In fact, it is a scandalous statement of reality.  The Minister's response or justification, in essence, will be that house prices are not expensive enough in those counties to warrant being considered for inclusion under the affordable housing scheme.  This is despite the fact that house prices in the Border region increased by almost 25% last year and 17% the year before.  How high do prices have to get before affordable housing will be provided?<\/p>  <p>The truth is that homeownership is already beyond the reach of most young workers and families and, at the same time, rents are completely out of control.  I want the Government either to accept that it is incapable of recognising the scale of the challenge or to admit it is not serious about meeting it.  It is one or the other.  We cannot say we are serious about homeownership and delivering houses, as the Minister does in this House from time to time, while a couple with four children earning &euro;27,000 cannot get on the social housing list in my county, cannot pay the rent and will never be in a position to buy their own home while the Government provides no affordable housing option to them.<\/p> <p> It is time to get real.

They were diplomatic in their answers, but it is clear they are working with one hand tied behind their back.  Finance decisions from the Department are taking too long.  Approved housing bodies are hamstrung.  While many people may be critical of Kildare County Council, I know from first-hand experience that they are seriously understaffed and under-resourced.  It takes up to three months to get a reply to a basic representation sent to Kildare County Council.  Every reply to a query about housing states that there are 6,600 people on the council's housing list.  The wait is ten to 12 years.  People must find their own housing assistance payment, HAP, properties.  You would need the miracle of the loaves and the fish, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, to consider HAP tenancies a solution.  Today there are just 28 rental properties available in the whole of County Kildare, just one of which is within the HAP limits.  There are only three properties available to rent for under &euro;1,000 a month.<\/p><p>It is clear the Government's private market approach is not working and many people are suffering because of it.  I have a list of 13 families, nine couples and 11 single people whose landlords have given them notice to quit because they are selling the properties.  The current rules do not allow the council to buy property with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  I have dealt with couples in emergency accommodation who are being accommodated separately.  The nuclear family used to be held in high regard; it does not seem that way any more.  I have been helping a mother who is raising four children alone since her husband left.  This week she had to explain to four young children that the sign the landlord has put up outside her home means they will have to move.  She faces emergency accommodation, if the council can actually find any, and the difficulty of getting kids to school in another town while trying to hold down her part-time job.<\/p><p>All these people are victims of poor Government policy.  The present Government's policies are too investor- and developer-orientated.  My colleague, an Teachta &Oacute; Broin, when he is Minister with responsibility for housing, will change that.  We have seen from the recent affordable housing targets that this Government lacks the will and ambition to address the housing crisis it has created, and it has created it.  The Government proposes to build just 45 affordable houses in Kildare per year over the next five years.  That is barely a drop in the ocean of what is needed.

What Sinn F&eacute;in is putting forward is very important.  It is part of our strategy to tackle the housing crisis by significantly increasing the number and delivery of affordable homes to buy.  It is important we have that big element of home purchase in our housing programmes.  That would make a massive difference to people throughout the country, especially in Laois-Offaly, where the housing crisis is having a devastating effect on the lives of too many people.  We have thousands of people trapped in private rental accommodation, where rents are out of control.  In Laois a three-bedroom house starts at &euro;1,058 per month; in Offaly, &euro;1,040.  The common asking rent for a house is now between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400 a month.  It is sky-high.  It is too high.  Many workers and families have incomes that are too high for the council's social housing waiting list but too low to get mortgage approval from a bank.  Workers on low and middle incomes are locked out of homeownership, and that is the problem.  They earn too much for the council and social housing lists, yet they are trapped paying sky-high rents, which are higher than what a mortgage on a comparable property would cost.  I have dealt with cases where people are paying rent of &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 per month.  If they could get a mortgage to buy a house of the same size, they would be paying &euro;800 a month.  It is crazy stuff.  In Laois-Offaly a couple earning more than - wait for it - &euro;504 a week are over the income threshold for council and social housing, while a couple with two children are over the limit if they earn just &euro;528.  What are they supposed to do?<\/p>  <p>  I raised this with the Minister and he sent a reply to me two weeks ago.  I keep getting the same reply, which is that Department officials are looking at the matter.  The Government needs to sort it out.  We need to do more to help these workers.  We need to deliver affordable homes for purchase.  Figures provided to Deputy &Oacute; Broin in recent weeks, which I have in front of me, reveal that the Government target under the affordable housing fund scheme from 2022 to 2026 for all of Laois is an average of nine houses per year, 38 in total, with none, not one single house, for Offaly.  That is totally unacceptable.  Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Government to revise the affordable home targets agreed with local authorities and to deliver an average of at least 4,000 affordable purchase homes a year throughout the State over the next four years.  More importantly, we need to deliver affordable homes that can be sold at prices that work and that people can afford.  The housing crisis is devastating the lives of workers and families across the country, and the Government and every one of us must do more to ensure people can buy genuinely affordable homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000039#NN00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

Ireland is experiencing an acute gap between housing supply and demand, exacerbated by the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and global supply-chain disruption, which requires both short and longer-term State interventions to address it;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; it is the ambition of the Government that everybody should have access to sustainable, good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, with the Housing for All strategy launched last year setting out plans to achieve this;  <\/blockquote>welcomes: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the development and implementation of the Housing for All strategy, and the commitment to massively expand the role of the State and to spend unprecedented sums of Exchequer multi-annual funding commitments to achieve the Government's aims;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the ambitious targets in the Housing for All strategy of over 300,000 new homes by 2030, including 36,000 for affordable purchase homes and 18,000 Cost Rental homes to provide competitive rents and long-term security of tenure for middle income earners, recognising that delivery will ramp up over time with increases in industry capacity and the effects of Government interventions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the successive record levels of State investment in housing under Budget 2021 and Budget 2022, comprised of capital investment of over &euro;4 billion and including funding of &euro;676 million specifically focused on affordability measures this year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the enactment of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the most comprehensive housing affordability legislation in the history of this State, which was passed overwhelmingly by this House and provided the basis for two new affordable purchase schemes and a national Cost Rental scheme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

the setting of distinct affordable housing delivery targets for local authorities, the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the 'First Home' Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme, which sees the numbers of affordable purchase and Cost Rental homes in the period to 2026 set at almost 29,000; this includes a target of 9,000 homes for local authorities, 8,000 for the 'First Home' Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme, almost 4,000 for AHBs, and almost 8,000 for the LDA;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the confirmation that measures introduced by the Housing for All strategy are helping to increase housing supply, with 5,669 new homes added to the national stock in Q1 of this year, the most in any first quarter since this official statistic began back in 2011, and 22,219 new homes completed in the last four quarters;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the clear increase in construction activity visible in the 34,846 new homes commenced in the 12 months to March 2022, the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data was first published;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the positive independent forecasts from the ESRI and the Central Bank, despite foreseen disruptions to construction, of housing completions for 2022 and 2023 meeting and potentially exceeding the targets in the Housing for All strategy;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the passage of the Land Development Agency Act 2021, establishing a powerful new body with a remit to take a strong role in delivering affordable housing for rent and purchase;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the delivery this year, for the first time in well over a decade, of affordable homes made available for purchase by local authorities, with the first such homes being made available in Cork City, Fingal and South Dublin at significantly discounted prices ranging from approximately &euro;218,000 to &euro;285,000, with more new homes to follow across the country later in the year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the planned launch in the coming months of the national 'First Home' Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme in the private market, which will help around 8,000 first-time buyers to purchase new homes in the lower half of the price distribution over the years to 2026;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government's reform and expansion of the Local Authority Home Loan, with a budget of &euro;250 million in 2022 alone, to improve affordability for lower and middle-income earners through lower fixed interest rate long-term loans, and broadening of the eligibility criteria to support higher numbers of single applicants struggling to purchase in Dublin, Cork and Galway;

the Government's continuing work under the Housing for All strategy in partnership with local authorities, the LDA, AHBs, and private industry which over the course of the plan will deliver an average of 4,000 affordable purchase and 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the use of the multi-annual Affordable Housing Fund to support local authorities in delivering new homes for affordable purchase and Cost Rental, with 1,731 new homes approved for funding so far, and further applications from local authorities currently under assessment;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the new affordable purchase schemes via local authorities and 'First Home' Affordable Purchase Shared Equity, which will support households with affordability challenges to achieve home ownership;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the further expansion of the Cost Rental sector in Ireland, which has already seen the first homes tenanted at rates of 40 per cent below market through the work of local authorities, the LDA, and AHBs;

<\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Deputy opposite for tabling the motion to give us an opportunity to have a debate on homeownership and affordable housing and to interrogate some of the things Members have said.  I welcome that opportunity.  One thing that is and should be recognised is that there is absolutely a difficulty with affordability.  The whole thrust of Housing for All is to tackle that.  I will expand on that shortly.  There is and has been a fundamental difficulty with supply, and we cannot ignore that.  We cannot ignore the past two years or, indeed, the past ten years of undersupply.  That is why it is crucial the Government brought forward the Housing for All plan, which is the first plan any government has brought forward that is funded on a multi-annual basis to the tune of &euro;4 billion to deliver more new-build social homes than ever before, 90,000 between now and 2030 and 9,000 alone this year, with 54,000 affordable homes, 29,000 of them between now and 2026.  I will deal with the matters raised in Sinn F&eacute;in's motion and some of the statements Members have made.  We are delivering cost rental for the first time ever, and we need private homes too.  We need 300,000 new homes between now and 2030 to address the undersupply of housing.  We passed the Affordable Housing Act.  I welcomed the support of most Deputies, with the exception of, I think, about eight at that stage, because I assumed from the fact Members opposite supported the Bill that they supported the thrust of the legislation.<\/p><p>Let us deal with the analysis that has been made based on a response to a parliamentary question.  There has been a deliberate misrepresentation of the affordable housing targets that have been set.  The affordable housing targets that have been referred to relate to local authority-delivered affordable homes and number 7,550 in total across the 31 local authorities between now and 2026.  What it states in the response to an Teachta &Oacute; Broin, a fact to which he did not refer earlier, is that, in addition to that targeted local authority delivery, affordable purchase and cost rental homes will also be made available by approved housing bodies - they deliver real homes too, as I think Members opposite will be aware - and by the Land Development Agency, LDA, in these local authority areas as part of the overall affordable housing delivery commitment under Housing for All.  In addition to that will be the affordable homes delivered under the First Home shared equity scheme, which we will launch and which will be available to people from 1 July of this year.  Each member of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party has decided to look at just part, one aspect, of that delivery.  That does not include Part V delivery either, I might add, and Members opposite know that too, but it does not suit their narrative.  That is okay.<\/p><p>We need to get back to a bit of reality and back to some truth and be honest with people.  Yes, there is an issue with affordability.  I am acutely aware of that.<\/p> <p>I believe in homeownership and I believe in giving people a start so that they can own their own homes.<br\/><br\/>When I look at the Sinn F&eacute;in &quot;plan&quot; - I use that word loosely - which is a 16-page document, eight pages of which are nice pictures of cups of coffee, I look through what Sinn F&eacute;in has looked for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000039#NN00400","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>For example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>This is Sinn F&eacute;in's policies.

The Housing for All plan was launched last September and is taking root already.  People deserve honesty.  They deserve a real plan that will work and that is taking effect rather than them coming here and quoting figures that are one quarter of what Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows anyway, because he deliberately left out the other part of the answer within the parliamentary question.  That might suit a narrative, and that is fine.  In fairness, people will look through that.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at what homeownership means to Sinn F&eacute;in.  I have been clear that I believe in homeownership and I believe people should get a start, but Sinn F&eacute;in's affordable housing would apparently deliver leasehold homes.  One would not own the home at the end of it and Sinn F&eacute;in would restrict who can buy that home and whom one can sell it to.  What it is conditional homeownership.  We need to make sure that across the board the measures taken by the Government activate supply.  That is the reason the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund was launched today.  Believe it or not, there are thousands of planning permissions, particularly in the cities, where we need compact urban growth.  We need to develop within the cities the brownfield sites that Sinn F&eacute;in says it wants to develop.  One needs a plan to do so and we are brave enough to put that forward and deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO01500","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Brilliant, having given developers a second bailout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO01600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Deputy Carthy was not here last week for the debate on rent-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO01700","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I was watching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO01800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>-----but the Deputy is carrying on as his colleagues did last week by continually interrupting me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO01900","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>If the Minister speaks nonsense, he will be challenged on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO02000","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1652208600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I respect this Chamber and always have.

This cohort, often called the squeezed middle, would say they pay for everything and are entitled to nothing, but house prices continue to spiral upwards.  The CSO residential property price index report for February 2022 shows that house prices across the State have risen by 13.5% and the median new-build house price for first-time buyers is now &euro;335,000.  That is not affordable for most people.  The Minister's response is a five-year total target for local authority affordable housing delivery of 5,555 houses.  It is dreadfully unambitious.  An entire generation is locked out of homeownership and the Government is only funding local authorities to build 7,550 affordable houses between now and 2026.<\/p>  <p>  Worse still is that the Government seems to think that there is no housing crisis in many parts of the country.  In my constituency, for example, not one of these 7,550 affordable houses is to be delivered in either Cavan or Monaghan, and yet the Daft.ie house price report of 2022 shows an 18.2% year-on-year average house price increase in Cavan from quarter 1 of last year to quarter 2 of 2022 and a 15.87% year-on-year increase in Monaghan for the same period.  People simply cannot afford to get on the housing ladder.<\/p>  <p>  People who lost their home to relationship breakdown or mortgage repossession face an uncertain future in the private rental sector.  Increasingly, the alternative option of renting is not possible for many people.  The latest report from the Residential Tenancies Board indicates that rent increases for new tenancies grew by 9% State-wide in the last three months of 2021.  Once again, if I refer to my constituency counties of Cavan and Monaghan, rents increased by 6.6% and 15.5%, respectively, over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is not doing enough.  The affordable purchase targets are embarrassingly low.  Only 18 counties are included in the targets.  The rest, like Cavan and Monaghan, will have zero delivery of local authority affordable housing.  We need an average of at least 4,000 genuinely affordable houses for working people each year and we need them built by each local authority.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to do something to help the many people who cannot afford to buy a house.  They cannot afford to rent.  They are not eligible for HAP or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  They are not eligible for any rent supplement.  They are forced to live with their parents.  In this day and age, it is disgraceful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000040#OO02600","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1652209200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The number of people who are either locked out of homeownership or even locked out of rental accommodation is genuinely staggering.  Leaving the statistics aside for the moment, all Deputies know from the calls they get to their offices that there is a fundamental problem with the availability of accommodation.  No family type is immune to this, be it families with young children, single parents with limited means or single people.  We have heard sad and horrific stories from them all and have tried to assist them in a housing market that is out of their reach whether it is to rent or to purchase.  It is awful to see people in this situation and it is appalling to know that the options to help them are extremely limited.<\/p>  <p>  It is common sense to devise a plan that tackles the housing crisis from every angle, whether from a rental point of view or from a purchasing perspective.  However, this Government does not think so.  That is apparent from the affordable housing targets up to 2026.  The Minister has the cheek to talk about narratives and the truth.  He has failed, just like other Deputies on that side of the House who have been Ministers with responsibility for housing.  According to the Daft.ie latest house price report, the average listing price in Tipperary increased year on year by 14.3%.  These price hikes contribute to local authority housing lists which are creaking at the seams.  At the same time, families are in hostels or sleeping on floors or sofas in the homes of friends or family members.  Outrageously, Tipperary does not even feature in the Government's unambitious affordable housing targets up to 2026.  This is at a time when the local authority is not only unable to provide accommodation for those on the lengthy housing list but is also struggling, and sometimes is unable, to provide emergency accommodation for those in need.<\/p>  <p>  Thousands of euro are being spent weekly on getting emergency accommodation in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels instead of providing councils with the capacity that I call for.  The Government prefers this than to allow local authorities such as Tipperary County Council to access the affordable housing fund.  We are calling for all local authorities to be allowed to access the affordable housing fund and to stop this practice of exclusion that destroys lives and severely affects families.  The unambitious affordable purchase home targets must be revised to deliver an average of at least 4,000 affordablepurchase houses per year from 2022 to 2026.  The Government must also stop contributing to the rising housing costs by scrapping the help-to-buy scheme and shared equity loan schemes, which push up prices, and divert the funding into the delivery of genuinely affordable houses.  The chief priority is that the Government must learn that giving massive handouts to big developers to deliver overpriced houses never works because struggling home buyers and the taxpayer will always be the big losers in that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000041#PP00100","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1652209200,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I stood here almost two years ago speaking on a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on the need to respect the demands of Irish people and to do something, anything, to mend the utterly broken system that is the Irish housing market.  Housing was one of the biggest issues in the 2020 general election and the new Government made a great deal of noise about the delivery of affordable housing.  Two years later, we are asking where the promised housing is.  The Government's affordable housing targets lack ambition, as many contributors have said.  The poor delivery is not the fault of councils or councillors, but of a Government that could not deliver an affordable and workable affordable housing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, affordable is not affordable in many areas.  We need at least 4,000 affordable homes per year, not the 7,000 every five years in the current plan.  South Dublin County Council, which is my area, will only see approximately 230 affordable homes per year.  Schemes in Killinarden, Clonburris and Rathcoole had over 3,000 expressions of interest.  In just one estate, 297 couples wanted to be considered for 16 houses.  The demand is there, but we are not meeting it.  Affordable housing would serve to normalise the housing market, take people out of the rental market and bring house prices down for everyone.  Many just cannot afford to buy or to rent, so what are they to do?  There is no way that the majority of young people in my area could afford to buy a home.  If one is paying obscene rents and the cost of living is rising, average incomes are not enough.  If one is lucky enough to get a deposit together, one then has to get in ahead of the investment firms that can outbid anybody with their unlimited funds.<\/p>  <p>  Two years into the Government's term, we need a massive house building programme on public lands and a scheme that delivers affordable housing to people who need it.

They are soul-destroying for anybody who needs a local authority-delivered home.  Yesterday was the first time I have ever seen a reply to a parliamentary question discussed in such detail in a local shop, and the commentary was absolutely damning.  Not one affordable home for Longford was included in that response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin - zero.  Last September, I read into the record the local media coverage of affordable housing when the director of services \"expressed his fears as written correspondence received by his department returned not very encouraging insights as to where Longford fits into the Government's plan\".  It is now crystal clear where Longford fits; it is in black and white.  It fits nowhere for local authority-delivered affordable homes.  What has been done to right this inherent wrong?  Has the Minister received the housing needs and demand analysis from Longford County Council, as discussed recently in the housing committee?  What engagement has there been to ensure that County Longford is not excluded?  What was the true purpose of that much-lauded backbencher letter to the Minister's Department?<\/p>  <p>  From 2022 to 2026, the so-called affordable housing target to be delivered by the local authority for Westmeath is 76, an average of 15 houses annually.  I have had more constituents with notices to quit in a day in my Westmeath offices.  What my constituents in Longford-Westmeath need is a dramatic increase in direct capital investment in local authority, genuinely affordable homes to buy.  The CSO price index shows an 11% increase in Longford and a 9.2% increase in Westmeath in the median price of a home.  Despite the Minister's rhetoric about believing in homeownership, rhetoric does not build properties.  Investment does, and investment in local authorities will meet the need for affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  We appear to have ever-changing and contradictory interpretations of what the word \"lease\" means from the Government.  After all, the Taoiseach told us that leasing the national maternity hospital is the equivalent of owning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000041#PP00300","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1652209200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Clarke's assessment and analysis.  Unfortunately, it is an all-too-common description that she has outlined to the House.  I do not always find myself in full agreement with every sentence of every Sinn F&eacute;in motion or Bill that is presented to the House.  We have our differences, and that is the cut and thrust of politics and is to be expected.  However, I find myself agreeing with every sentence in the motion before us.  I do so without any hesitation.<\/p>  <p>  In any progressive society and successful economy worth the name the aspiration to one day own one's own home should be within the reach of most, if not all, working people.  I know the Minister agrees with that sentiment and that ambition.  However, we have been saying for a considerable number of years that nowhere is the social contract more broken than in respect of housing supply.  When we talk about housing supply, we know the trick is to get the diversity of that supply right.  That means a mix of public homes, affordable homes and private homes built to last through the life cycle in a community and reflecting the rich diversity in every community.  Regrettably, the approach taken by the last Government and continued by this one, with some small changes, is all wrong.  Whether it relates to public housing, cost rental or the building of affordable homes, the excessive reliance on private developers to deliver the stock we need is the Achilles heel of this Government's housing project.<\/p>  <p>  As the motion notes, both Housing for All and the Government's proposals for affordable housing more generally lack ambition with regard to the provision of the required amount of housing annually.  I agree with that assessment.  This is even more stark when one looks at the specific proposals for the provision of affordable purchase homes and cost rental.<\/p> <p>At the time of the launch of Housing for All, commentators such as the ESRI suggested that up to 50,000 homes a year may need to be delivered on an annual basis to meet the requirements of our growing population.  Since then, as the Minister has said, the challenge has become even deeper with the crisis in Ukraine and the responsibilities the State has in welcoming refugees fleeing their war-torn country.<br\/><br\/>The State needs to have greater ambition with respect to the provision of housing and how much is required every year.  This is even more so with respect to the delivery of affordable housing and all it entails.  Up to 2030 there will be 18,000 cost rental units.  This is an average of only 2,000 apartments and homes that will be delivered through this stream each year.  The commitment to 10,000 social homes a year is simply not enough given the demands that we face.  We all know this.  As I stated earlier in my contribution, the Government continues to rely excessively on the private sector for the delivery of housing generally and the supply of affordable housing more specifically.  We believe the State should provide a minimum of 20,000 homes a year.  This requires a much more direct and hands-on role in the housing system than the Minister is prepared to take.<br\/><br\/>I am very concerned by the Government's repeated focus on the incentivisation of investors in the private sector, especially in the build-to-rent sector.  This will simply not deliver sustainable communities or secure housing.  This is back in focus in light of recent reports that the Minister is considering providing incentives of more than &euro;100,000 to developers to build apartments.  We have to stop doling out cash to incentivise development rather than recognising that to resolve the housing crisis what is required is direct State delivery at a much higher level and a more intensive rate.  In addition, we must give local authorities the funding they need to build homes.  Data show that expenditure has decreased by 53% from last year.  We need answers as to why the State is not properly funding direct build projects and instead is proposing yet another set of grants for developers.  The delivery of homes rather than profits must be the priority.  We are at odds with the Minister over how best it should be done.<br\/><br\/>The motion is about the affordability of homes.  The question of what constitutes affordability is another question that divides the House.  The Government needs to put a clear definition of affordability on a statutory footing.  My colleague Senator Moynihan has been saying this for a long time.  This definition should approach affordability from the perspective of an ordinary person seeking a roof over their heads rather than simply a market discount.  The motion rightly points to affordability at O'Devaney Gardens where the full price is considered to be &euro;400,000.  This is four times the salary of a Deputy.  I say this for context and illustrative purposes.  Affordability must be defined by the income of one individual rather than predicated on the idea that everyone buying a home is doing so in a traditional family unit, if I can describe it as such, or a couple.  Family and household formation, as we all know, is very diverse these days.  It comes in many forms and this is as it should be.  More than 400,000 people in Ireland live alone.  Single people should not be locked out of the market simply because of their family status and how they decide to live their lives.<br\/><br\/>Housing for All still does not deliver enough State-led social and affordable housing.  The Labour Party wants this increased to 20,000 homes per year to address existing need and unmet demand.  We believe, as we said last October in the costed proposals of our alternative budget, we should build a further 2,000 social homes in 2022 in addition to the targeted 10,000 under all delivery streams funded for next year under the national development plan.  The Government also proposes a further 2,100 affordable homes this year. <br\/><br\/>We believe a fund should be established to provide increased levels of affordable housing over five years, starting with &euro;5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and &euro;500 million of annual seed capital.  This would make good social and economic sense.  It would make economic sense from an investment point of view for the taxpayer over the longer term.  It would make our economy more successful.  I say this because when we speak to the American Chamber of Commerce, IBEC and other employer bodies, they tell us that from a competitiveness perspective they are no longer concerned about issues such as labour costs and other issues they have routinely raised with politicians over the years.  What they are speaking about now in terms of our competitiveness challenge is the lack of affordable homes for the skilled workers on whom our economic success and competitiveness in terms of foreign direct investment will depend.  This is a massive challenge.  Even if we have Government Members whose the ideology is that there is no function for the State - they believe it should be decided by the market and only the market should provide homes, with some additional units provided by local authorities - if they are interested in the development of the economy they should say we really need to crack this for our future economic success.  It needs to be looked at through an economic lens also.<br\/><br\/>Many colleagues have mentioned the experience in their constituencies of the provision and supply of affordable and private homes to buy.  House prices in my constituency of Louth rose by 8% in the first few months of 2022.  This is on top of the 12% rise we saw a year ago.  The average price of a home in my county is &euro;257,000.  This is more than 100% above the lowest point in the previous recession, which is in recent memory as we all know.  We are still living with the consequences of it and the dysfunctionality of the housing market and the housing supply system more generally.  When we look at these figures, it is much more pronounced in my home area of Drogheda given the proximity to Dublin.  The averages in Louth do not tell the entire story.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday we had a shocking story in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  The figures speak for themselves.  Only a tiny number of affordable purchase homes will be built between now and 2026 under the Government's targets.  In Louth only 45 homes will be built on average every year.  It is one of the fastest growing parts of the country.  As we know, many people are leaving the capital to live in areas such as Drogheda, Laytown and Bettystown, which are within half an hour or three quarters of an hour by public transport or car to the city centre.  This is a derisory level of investment given the scale of the challenge.<br\/><br\/>The Minister will especially understand this point.  He should take the advice of senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Central Bank and scrap the ridiculous help-to-buy scheme.  It is a subsidy for developers.  That is all it is.  It is driving house prices up.  It is a deadweight investment.  It is bad public policy.  The money allocated to it from the shared equity scheme should be diverted directly to those who would build the affordable homes we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000041#PP00400","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652209800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank an Teachta &Oacute; Broin for the motion.  The Social Democrats will support it.  It gives us an opportunity to discuss these issues on affordability and housing.  I want to respond to a couple of things the Minister said.  He spoke about the need for supply and the problem with people objecting to housing.  It is worth noting that the people who voted to dezone land earmarked specifically for 100 social housing homes in South Dublin County Council were not, as far as I know, Green Party councillors or from People Before Profit, the Social Democrats, Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in or the Labour Party.  The people who did it were Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors.  They voted to dezone the land in the middle of a housing emergency.  If the decision is not reversed it will deprive us of 100 social homes that are badly needed in south Dublin.  If the Minister is serious in his comments on this, he really should call on these councillors to reconsider their position.  He should show some leadership on it.<\/p>  <p>  We saw at the launch of Housing for All, and we heard again in the Chamber today, Ministers commenting on their belief in home ownership.  They can say that all they want but the reality is that under the Government, home ownership is in freefall.  It has been collapsing since Fine Gael took office in 2011.  The Parliamentary Budget Office, which is independent, recently concluded that home ownership among adults of prime working age between 25 to 54 in Ireland has collapsed.  We know from analysis done by Mel Reynolds and Lorcan Sirr that the number of new homes available for individuals to buy last year fell to its lowest level in several years to fewer than 6,000.  There were only 5,698 new homes available for individuals to buy throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>Why is this happening?  It is because more and more investment funds are buying up homes and more and more build to rent is dominating.  Analysis by Dublin City Council shows that 82% of planning permissions sought or obtained in 2020 were for build to rent.  That is what is happening under this Government.<\/p> <p> The previous speaker said the Government was considering giving a grant of &euro;100,000 to developers.  Unfortunately, there is no evidence this is under consideration.  The Government has published the details of this and it is not &euro;100,000.  It is up &euro;120,000 per apartment.  This is effectively a gift of public money to developers.  What is it with this Government gifting public money and resources to private interests?  Why is it so keen on doing this?  Why will it not use that money to create better public services and directly build more affordable and cost rental homes?  For &euro;120,000, it could buy the sites for these apartments at probably about &euro;30,000 and then build them out as affordable or cost rental at much more affordable rates using low interest loans from the Housing Finance Agency that are much more cost effective than private finance.  Why is the Government not doing that?  It is not even &euro;120,000 that is the cap on this.  The document published by the Government says that while it has a ceiling of &euro;120,000, it may be exceeded by no more than 20% in certain cases so the real cap could be &euro;144,000 per developer.  Should we be surprised when developers come back and say building costs have increased and end up looking for more?<\/p> <p> The key issue in terms of this gifting of public money to developers is the question of who asked for it.  Who asked for it?  It was not the ESRI or any independent commentators.  I am quite sure that when we get the detail, we will find that the people who asked for this are developers and their lobbyists.  The Government document on this and how it defines the viability gap reads like something straight out of what the developers and their lobbyists talk about.  In fact, the viability gap was not an issue several years ago but is something that has been exploited quite considerably by developers and their lobbyists.  I want to quote from a paper by Dr. Richard Waldron.  He interviewed policymakers, planners, politicians and lobbyists for the development industry.  He said that \"a complicit State has further liberalised the planning system, introducing an array of policies that are ever more facilitative of development interests\".  He goes on to discuss the viability cap.  What is this viability gap?  How is it defined?  We are not told how it is defined by the Government in what it has published.  It has not told us whether it includes a profit margin of at least 15% for developers, because that is how they define their viability gap.  Is the Government going to come clean and tell us whether its subsidy of &euro;120,000, which may go up to &euro;144,000, per apartment will include a profit margin of at least 15% profit for developers, because that is how they define viability?  These are resources that could and should be put directly into affordable purchase homes and cost rental built on a not-for-profit basis rather than this developer-led way.<\/p> <p> I will quote once more from Dr. Waldron because it is important.  A lobbyist featured in his research spoke about how they have inputted into the planning process.  The lobbyist said they gave all the headings, the first draft was written, the lobbyist reviewed it, described what they wanted in terms of the level of tax relief, a policy was agreed and the law was written up.  That is what developers are telling researchers in terms of their influence on planning, tax and other aspects of housing policy.<\/p> <p> Incredibly, no affordability is built into this.  I do not think we should be giving a subsidy to developers at all, but if we do, surely there should be some sort of affordability criterion.  There is none.  The homes are going to be sold at market value but we are not told how the market value will be set exactly.  Regarding build to rent schemes and investment funds, which are pushing up the price of apartments, will market values be set against them, because they are impossible values for most people to be able to afford?<\/p> <p> Incredibly, given this level of public money going to developers and the significant climate crisis, there is no sign of any carbon budgets, limits or ceilings in terms of these developments.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State that we are out of time in terms of the climate crisis and that nothing is more urgent than what we do to address it, yet his Government is giving public subsidies to developers to build these houses with no affordability measures built in, no discount off full market prices and no measures to ensure carbon ceilings or limits in terms of the embodied carbon aspect of these developments.  That makes no sense to people who care about the environment and people struggling to afford to buy a home.<\/p> <p> Will the Government withdraw these outrageous proposals to gift public money to developers through these subsidies and instead use this money to buy up dormant planning permissions and sites and build genuinely affordable homes to rent or buy?  We know that works.  We know it has been done well in other countries so why can it not be done here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000042#QQ00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652210400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion.  The housing crisis is a failure of the market, the State, this Government and previous Governments.  We see that failure everywhere when it comes to dealing with the housing crisis.  Often when we have debates about the housing crisis, the Government likes to say that those of us in opposition and the left are approaching this from a very ideological viewpoint, that this is why we are giving out about money being given to developers and that the Government is the pragmatist.  Certainly People Before Profit is ideological.  We do not hide that.  Our ideology is in our name; we put people before profit.  We take a socialist approach to the housing crisis, which means people's right to a home should come before the right of developers, bankers and landlords to profit.  The Government likes to deny it has an ideology when its own ideology is very clearly a major part of the problem because, against all the evidence of all the actions it has tried, the Government is committed that the way to solve the housing crisis is to incentivise private developers to build homes.  It is the idea that if private developers are incentivised enough, eventually somehow it will work and the housing crisis will be resolved.  Of course, that ideology has the very happy coincidence of also serving the material interests of the developers in this country, who were the ones receiving the public money.  The points around bridging the construction viability gap and doling out huge amounts of public money to developers really underline that point.<\/p>  <p>  The Government already had the help-to-buy scheme, which was fundamentally a help-to-profit scheme for developers.  It was about funnelling money through the hands of first-time buyers into the hands of developers and increasing property prices to incentivise the developers to keep building.  Looking at the origin of the help-to-buy scheme, that was explicit in terms of the lobbying from the Construction Industry Federation.  However, the Government is now bypassing the middle man.  It is not even bothering to put money momentarily into the hands of the first-time buyer before it goes to the developer.<\/p> <p>The Government is just going to give the money directly to the developers.  It is going to give developers &euro;120,000 per apartment to bridge the construction viability gap.  The point was well made by Deputy O'Callaghan that it will also include profit for the developer.  To add insult to injury, we can forget about the &euro;120,000 cap when it comes to regional cities because the Government will go up to &euro;144,000.  The handout will not be used to lower the price of the apartments.  It will not come with any conditions.  It is merely a massive handout to the already very wealthy.  This is nothing new for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  When many of the same developers crashed the economy and ended up in NAMA, they got salaries of close to &euro;200,000 a year to continue to operate.  These are the corporate welfare cheats who cheat us all.  Instead of throwing more public money at them, we should use public money for direct, State-led construction of genuinely affordable and social housing, providing quality employment, apprenticeships for workers and so on.<\/p> <p> Another example of this approach, incentivising developers and using lots of public money to do so, is the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  We have seen &euro;200 million of public money spent through LIHAF building roads and infrastructure for private developers to help them to profit.  Originally the promise was that 40% of homes built on LIHAF-funded land would have to be affordable but very quickly the Government backed away from that and said there would be some unstated \"haircut\" for profits on these sites.  In Cherrywood we have seen massive amounts of funding spent but we have heard nothing about what level of affordable housing will be provided and how genuinely affordable it will be.<\/p> <p> This gets to the core of the problem with the Government's approach to and plan for affordable housing.  It is like Humpty Dumpty, who said \"When I use a word... it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less\".  The Government uses the word \"affordable\" and just says that this is affordable housing, even though by any ordinary person's standards, it is simply not affordable.  The idea is that &euro;450,000 is an affordable price for a house in Dublin.  The Government cannot just say it, slap the label \"affordable\" on it and then, all of a sudden, people will be able to afford it; they still cannot afford it, no matter what the Government calls it.  The whole problem, again, comes back to the ideology of the market.  How does the Government determine affordability?  Affordability is simply a percentage of market value.  Affordability means a knockdown, a 10% or 20% reduction from the market value but when the market value is so completely out of control, with homes that are completely unattainable for ordinary middle-income earners, then a small reduction still leaves them absolutely unaffordable.  Affordability should be defined in the language of ordinary people and refer to something that ordinary workers could actually afford.  We should stop pinning affordability to the market and instead connect it to average incomes.  No workers should have to pay more than 25% of their income for a roof over their heads.  <\/p> <p> I would also make the point that where we have affordable housing and the State is investing public money to develop affordable housing, which we support, we must make sure those homes do not end up in the hands of vulture funds or corporate landlords further down the line.  We know that there are corporate investors looking to profit from the State's spending on housing.  This is why we argue that all affordable housing purchase schemes must include strong clauses to ensure the units can only be sold back to the local authority so that they remain affordable through generations.  In effect, this is another model of public housing provision.<\/p> <p> In terms of the numbers of affordable units being built, the figures are pitiful with less than 50 affordable homes in some of the key commuter towns around Dublin, and only eight per year in Carlow and Laois.  It is window dressing from the Government; it is fiddling while Rome burns.  Dr. Rory Hearne has described the figures as \"pathetic\" and he is completely correct.  It seems that only 16 homes have been built under the current local authority affordable purchase scheme.  Over 300 families have applied for those 16 homes, with the gap between the crisis and the Government's actions summed up in these figures.  <\/p> <p> Fundamentally, what it all comes down to is the continued reliance on the market and catering to developers' needs rather than the needs of the people.  The Minister's plan is failing and will continue to fail because it does not address the core issues behind the crisis, namely the over-reliance on the market to deliver a basic necessity as well as the acceptance of further commodification of what is an essential need.  The Government's housing policy is built on a fundamental, ideological fallacy that if we incentivise developers, financiers and builders enough, they will eventually deliver what people need.  The D&aacute;il has changed laws to encourage corporate landlords into the system.  We have abandoned any attempt to control or limit evictions.  The Government has eulogised private property rights over the right to housing.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, seems to have the ear of every housing Minister, with the Minister on speed dial, taking the federation's proposals and putting them into law.  The Government has changed the law, the building regulations and the apartment specifications.  It has even decided to fund and grant access to finance based on whatever these vested interests want.  Whatever they want, the Government bends over backwards for them in the hope that ultimately, they will deliver.  We have the utterly farcical situation whereby the corporate lobbyists, in the form of the CIF, have been put in charge of keeping a register to ensure proper standards in the building industry.  So enmeshed is our housing and urban planning policy with the needs of those vested interests that the Government seems to get confused.<\/p> <p> It was once said that what is good for General Motors is good for the USA.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael seem to believe that what is good for the CIF, corporate landlords and developers is good for ordinary people in Ireland but the truth is that it is not.  The truth is that they have diametrically opposed class interests.  They benefit when the prices rise and ordinary people suffer.  Every failed target, every jump in homeless figures, every eviction and every hike in rents proves that what is good for the vested interests is most definitely not good for ordinary people in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000043#RR00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652211000,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion this evening.  It is important to reflect on what is happening right now.  We have people in every constituency, including in my own constituency of Galway East, who cannot find a house to rent and people who want to buy a house but cannot find one to buy.  We also have a situation whereby the social housing waiting list is growing and there is so much pressure.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is not working as it should.  People who have houses to rent are not willing to participate in the HAP scheme any more because there are too many risks involved.  We must look at all of this and determine how we are going to push forward and build ourselves out of this crisis.  That is what we must focus on.<\/p>  <p>  On the affordable housing scheme, the numbers announced yesterday are very disappointing.  A total of 75 houses for Galway county is not a huge amount in the second largest county, geographically, in the country.  If one looks at the multiplying factors across all counties, the scheme has been started, it has been called an affordable scheme but it is going to take a hell of a long time to get to a stage where it is effective and working.<\/p>  <p>  I will now repeat things I have said previously in this House in relation to opportunities that we have.  Why not make existing derelict houses in our towns and villages affordable for people to go in, build, occupy and live in?  The Minister for Finance is in disagreement with me on extending the help-to-buy scheme to these properties.  It is fine if he does not want to do that, but the Government needs to take strong, effective action to make these properties available so that people can go in, do them up and turn them into liveable spaces in our towns and villages.  <\/p> <p>It is very important that we tackle that rather than saying we cannot do this or that.  There are 44,000 of these houses in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly area.  A survey has been done by the regional assembly so the figures are there.  Really and truly, what we need to do is take action on that.<\/p> <p> The other thing the Government announced was a &euro;50 million fund to improve the wastewater needs in rural towns and villages in Ireland, which is a scheme under which the local authorities can apply for funding.  There are so many of our towns and villages that do not have any wastewater treatment plant.  They are locked out of the planning system and the construction system because they cannot apply for planning permission on the basis that they will not be granted it and, even if they were granted it, that would be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the basis that any type of development would be premature.<\/p> <p> There are towns around Galway, such as Abbeyknockmoy, Corofin and Craughwell, to mention three, where, right now, we could be building houses if we had a municipal treatment plant.  Sites are available for affordable houses and we could get on with it.  They are within easy distance for connection for work to Galway city or Athlone, which is just off the motorway, but we are not doing that.  Some &euro;50 million is a pathetic amount of money to put into that.  If that is what it is for, it probably needs to be ten times that sum if we are to tackle this problem.  What we are doing in Galway might shock the Minister of State as a member of the Green Party.  We are now talking about putting in clusters of houses where we will allow people to build five houses in a cluster and put five individual septic tanks into towns and villages.  I do not think that is environmentally sustainable.  That is what we are doing because we are not getting the money to have municipal treatment plants in these towns.<\/p> <p> We need to take it for what it is.  We need to make sure that this problem is sorted out, once and for all.  We have so much opportunity but we seem to get caught up in talking about schemes and how we are going to develop them.  I know the local authorities, including Galway County Council, are working hard to deliver housing and they are delivering some housing, but they need a hell of a lot more support, resources, management, funding and infrastructure to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000044#SS00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652211600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>A poll published the other day by Ireland Thinks in association with the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>asked people which of the following issues should be the most important priorities to deal with.  There was a long list of answers, but leading the way by far as the most popular two responses were the cost of living and housing.  Instead of really getting to grips with them, the Government is wasting energy pursuing a climate change agenda at a rate of knots, with little regard for the costs, to appease a party that is now languishing at 3% in the opinion polls.  There is no significant demand for the Government&rsquo;s climate policies at this emergency pace, but there is significant demand for the housing issue to be sorted out, although it seems only at a snail&rsquo;s pace.<\/p><p>To be fair, not all the problems associated with housing can be blamed on the Government but the Government must ensure that it is controlling the controllables.  We in this House are legislators.  We make rules and regulations which govern people&rsquo;s behaviour in Ireland, so I do not expect the Government to be able to solve problems with global supply chains, for example, but I do expect the Government to ensure that the conditions are suitable in Ireland to allow a thriving building sector and stimulate the construction of housing.  All of the rules and regulations governing the sector are choices made by Governments.  The consequences of these choices have been stark for people looking to get a house of their own.  Over the last ten years, successive Governments have consistently placed barriers in the way of houses being built and these barriers have all contributed to the current problematic housing situation.  Barriers have been placed in the way of builders who want to build the houses, and in the way of people who want to buy the houses.<\/p><p>I am getting fed up pointing out that the problem of housing being unaffordable will not be improved unless something is done to enable the average builder to build a house with less State-imposed cost barriers in the way.  These State-imposed cost barriers include State bodies like An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Office of the Planning Regulator advising on minimum density being imputed into county development plans that do not exist in law, more often than not resulting in judicial review being taken when minimum densities are stipulated as part of a grant of planning.  Minimum densities are often the reason developments do not go ahead, with unnecessarily onerous and costly conditions to be met before permission is given for developments and also the dezoning of lands serving to reduce the number of houses being built.<\/p><p>The social contract is broken for people in their 20s and 30s and now often for many in their 40s too.  Those working as garda&iacute;, nurses, teachers or any of those jobs traditionally regarded as good, steady Government jobs cannot afford to buy a home.  Over the last ten to 15 years, Government Departments have also made it more difficult for certain employees to be considered permanent, again harming their chances of qualifying for a mortgage.  I know of a couple in their mid to late 20s in County Wexford who have a combined gross income of approximately &euro;85,000 per year and have combined savings of almost three times the required deposit, yet cannot qualify for a mortgage due to the nature of their employment contracts.  Both of these people have displayed an ability to manage money, are debt-free, work hard, are well-educated and, to all intents and purposes, are a safe bet from a mortgage point of view.  However, Government-imposed rules mean those two people cannot get on the housing ladder.  Living with parents is the best possible scenario for thousands of people in situations like this and, for many, it means extortionate rents or homelessness.  We need to examine where the social contract fell apart and start repairing it.<\/p><p>Forcing a building contractor to build a certain amount of affordable homes in a development will not solve those problems.  A first-time buyer has enough on his or her plate without the local county council competing with him or her to buy a house, thus driving up the price in the process.  If the Government is really committed to ensuring affordable houses are built, then it is time it looked at its tax take on new homes.  The Government could take less than the current 13% VAT rate.  It could follow in the steps of our neighbours in Britain and the North &ndash; if it is serious about providing affordable homes, that is - and reduce the tax take to zero.  There is no reason it cannot do so.  Affordability is what a potential buyer can afford to pay for a house.  Given the constraints imposed by the Central Bank&rsquo;s mortgage lending rules, reducing vat to zero is the only measure that will put a new home in reach of the couple in Wexford earning &euro;85,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000045#TT00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1652211600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Deputies Michael Collins, Richard O'Donoghue, Mattie McGrath and Carol Nolan are sharing time.

We have the young married couples, both with fairly good jobs, who cannot get a mortgage.  There is something wrong.  They cannot find a house to buy, even if they could get a mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look outside the box.  I know of people who live in log cabins and are happy to do so for a few years, but they are scared that the planning authority will come knocking on the door some day and kick them out.  Why not look at the idea of people living in containers?  I have actually seen quite a nice set-up in many places but, again, they are afraid of the planning authority coming knocking on the door, which has happened in some cases in west Cork and they have had to pull them down.  Beautiful living accommodation, with two containers, one on top of the other, is gone and the person is out on the street, basically.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I want to bring up the issue of planning permission in west Cork, which is such a difficulty for many young people.  I do not know what percentage I have been told about in my office but a huge number of people are coming to me looking for planning.  These are genuine applicants, young people trying to get off the ground, and they have been refused for the silliest reasons that could ever be known.  Some people have just got a site from their mom or dad and that is the one break they get.  Then, their opportunity is to go out there and build that dream home for themselves, but they cannot.  That is broken for them and they are back into the social housing system again, looking for a house from the State.  That is not what they want; they want to go out on their own.<\/p>  <p>  Many houses in small towns and villages in rural Ireland are lying in ruins with no slates or roofs.  This is an area that needs to be looked at.  Rural Ireland can create major solutions to many of the problems that are out there in housing today but it has never been looked at.  It is a sad reflection.  Post offices and various important resources in towns and villages are closing because of that.<\/p> <p>Sewage treatment is a major issue down in west Cork.

In the region of 1,400 affordable houses will be delivered by the State this year.  Some 1,000 of those will be in Dublin and 256 homes will be built in the other four cities.  The delivery target for Limerick local authority is for 264 local authority houses to be built between now and 2026.  A total of  53 of those were built this year in Limerick.  I am working with a village in County Limerick which has planning for 70 houses some of which are pre-sold.

They are waiting for another 12 months for water to come to Croom in County Limerick.  I can deliver 70 houses.  The local authority can deliver 56 houses.  I am only talking about one town in County Limerick.  This goes back to infrastructure which I have said to the Minister of State many times and to many Governments.

There is a general feeling of hopelessness among my constituents and throughout the entire country because things only seem to be getting worse and sadly they are not wrong.<\/p>  <p>  House prices are spiralling out of control and the market is showing no signs of slowing.  In my constituency of Donegal the average house price jumped by &euro;5,000 in the first three months of this year and in the three months previous to that it had risen by an average of &euro;6,000.  This represents a year-on-year increase of &euro;25,000 in total.<\/p>  <p>  The continued rise in prices has occurred across the entire housing market and has even occurred among older houses that would require considerable work, despite the continually increasing cost of construction and renovation these days.  At the end of the fourth quarter last year there were 269 properties for sale in Donegal, which was a decrease of 10.3% over the quarter.  There is no doubt that demand has far outstripped supply, especially in Letterkenny, as Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, attains technological university status.<\/p> <p>There is also a demand for supply in areas affected by mica.  One estate agent in Milford said that \"the ongoing situation with defective blocks has hampered market activity for the more recently constructed properties, as continued uncertainty plagues the redress scheme\".<\/p> <p> I raised this issue with the Taoiseach earlier.  I was very disappointed with his response.  These families are faced with agonising uncertainty day after day.  They were promised that legislation would be published at the start of this year.  It is now May, but we have seen no movement on this aspect.  It was also promised that the legislation would be published at Easter.  That did not happen either.  Moreover, we are now being told that the legislation will not undergo pre-legislative scrutiny.  This is totally unacceptable.  It is essential that important legislation like this is scrutinised properly.  The Government cannot use the line of wanting to get legislation through quickly as an excuse not to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny.  This Bill should have been prioritised.  Mica has been an issue for a long time.  Pre-legislative scrutiny should have been completed before the new year, with the aim of publishing the legislation at the start of 2022.  There is no reason why this could not have been done, except for the lack of Government will.<\/p> <p> Every month the legislation is delayed is another month of uncertainty for those families affected by mica and for the housing market in Donegal.  Having to endure the mica crisis is bad enough, but having to endure the housing crisis on top of that is devastating for these families.  I hope the Government remembers this as it continues to delay the legislation and decides to exclude important voices from the scrutiny process relating to it.  I say that because members of a Mica Action Group would see through the legislation straight away and recognise if there were any problems with it.  Perhaps that is the reason the legislation is not going for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Government tried to hoodwink the Mica Action Group in December when it made an announcement at 8 a.m.  Within an hour, people from the group had torn that proposal apart and determined what was involved in it.  I am afraid that is what is going to happen with this legislation as well.<\/p> <p> I also support the call to scrap the help-to-buy scheme, as well as the first home affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  It has been shown that these schemes serve only to push up prices and divert funding from delivering affordable homes.  We should, instead, be significantly increasing our direct investment in the provision of genuinely affordable homes through local authorities and approved housing bodies.  This would be a real and effective measure to tackle the housing situation.  It seems, however, that the Government has no real interest in tackling this matter.  The Minister has not fulfilled his promise to deliver affordable homes.  This Government&rsquo;s housing policies not only do nothing to help struggling people, but have actually further contributed to the housing crisis through schemes such as these, which have just created further inflation.<\/p> <p> We have seen proof of this in the continued rise in prices and the stock of homes for sale falling to a historic low of just 11,300.  The shortage of housing stock for sale or rental is most acute in the rural areas.  Analysis has shown that house prices are now seven times average incomes.  The Central Bank and the ESRI estimate that the mortgage lending rules have actually stopped house prices rising by an additional 10% to 25% over existing levels.  This is not sustainable and we cannot continue in this way.  Our citizens are asking for help and it is our job to do all in our power to help them.  I urge the Government to consider the proposals in this motion.  Its amendment to the motion is not good enough and is most certainly not ambitious enough.  The Housing for All strategy is watery at best.  Relying on this strategy to address the issues arising is not good enough and will never do anybody any good.  To emphasise this point, in the amendment, the Minister quotes the Covid-19 pandemic as being one of the big problems with housing supply.  He is probably disappointed that he is not in the Department of Health, because then he could blame the cyberattack as well.  It has also been something of great benefit in explaining delays.<\/p> <p> It is time we moved away from the failed housing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il and high time the members of this Government started listening to their constituents and to people on the ground who have been consistently saying that what the Government is doing is not working.  It is time for a change.  Implementing the proposals in this motion would be a positive step toward delivering that change.  This is what is needed now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000046#UU00500","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652212800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have an opportunity to speak in this debate.  I know time is limited.  To be honest, when I see members of Sinn F&eacute;in come into this House criticising the Government for not delivering affordable homes to buy, I take a very deep breath.  They come as a wolves in sheep's clothing.  The reality is that they oppose five important measures from the Government that will together deliver 50,000 homes at affordable prices to first-time buyers in the next five years.  These measures include: the help-to-buy scheme, which will deliver at least 32,000 houses, because that is what it has delivered in the past four years; the first home affordable purchase shared equity scheme, which will deliver 8,000 homes to people at affordable prices; support for first-time buyers in our cities to access multi-unit properties, which are expensive for first-time buyers - this will deliver 5,000 homes, as I saw announced by the Minister today; and the Land Development Agency, through its Project Tosaigh and activities on State lands, will deliver a further 8,000 homes.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in opposes all these measures, which account for the 50,000 homes we will deliver in the years to come at affordable prices.  Sinn F&eacute;in's view is extremely narrow.  It insists on a narrow ideological approach that will not have any private homes on public lands.  It is a narrow approach that will condemn people to not being able to gain access to homes at affordable prices.  It is a housing apartheid policy that Dublin does not need.  We need integrated communities, which the Government's policy seeks to pursue, and I commend the Government on creating a framework that is capable of delivering.  We have seen 35,000 housing starts in the past 12 months.  It is a significant step forward.<\/p>  <p>  There can, however, be no room for complacency.  I worry about installing fixed-price contracts because of rising costs.  We must address this aspect.  I also worry about the vigour with which the Land Development Agency is bringing forward sites that can drive down site values.  I urge the Minister of State to continue to deliver as quickly as possible in these two areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000047#VV00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1652212800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I wish to record my support for the help-to-buy scheme and my total dismay at the idea of abolishing it.  This is what is being put forward by the Opposition.  The help-to-buy scheme does exactly what it says on the tin: it helps people to buy their first homes.  It has been a welcome financial contribution for many families, some 32,000 people to be exact.  Almost &euro;600 million has been paid out under the scheme to help people to buy their first homes.  In Dublin alone last year, the help-to-buy scheme helped 1,127 people.  The figures prove it is helping people.  The very notion of abolishing a scheme that has provided 32,000 people and young couples with financial assistance towards buying their own homes is just mad.  Yet that is what Sinn F&eacute;in is suggesting, namely, getting rid of a support scheme for first-time buyers.  It is a prime example of opposition for opposition's sake.  If anything, we should be expanding the help-to-buy scheme and not abolishing it.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding affordable housing targets, the Government aims to provide 28,000 affordable homes by the end of 2026.  This will be done through multiple channels and not just through the affordable housing funds.  This year, affordable and social housing delivery will be achieved through the allocation of &euro;4 billion in capital and current investment.  In the next three years, &euro;20 billion of State investment will be poured into housing.  In eight years' time, under the Housing for All policy, there will be 90,000 extra social homes, 36,000 new affordable purchase homes and 18,000 new cost-rental homes.  This is the difference between the Government and the Opposition.  The Government's targets are real and its plans costed.  The strategy is multi-annual, multibillion, already in motion and already helping people.  It is rooted in reality and backed up by financial packages.  The proposals we hear again and again from the Opposition, however, are pie in the sky and based on fairy-tale economics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000047#VV00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1652212800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Regarding the point raised by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan concerning carbon budgets, all developments are now covered by building regulations and energy standards.  We had two contributions that said we are giving too much to developers, while others said we are not giving enough.  The LIHAF scheme is important in frontloading infrastructure.  Deputy Verona Murphy made disgraceful comments regarding wasting energy pursuing a climate agenda.  This is a reminder that this issue is about our common home as well.<\/p>  <p>  In closing, I acknowledge the current highly-visible reality of price inflation.  New housing supply in Ireland, like much of the EU, has been impacted by periods of reduced construction activity in the context of the Covid-19 crisis and global supply chain issues.<\/p> <p>The war in Ukraine has exacerbated inflationary pressures with rising energy and material costs impacting many sectors, including construction.  Ireland is not a unique case but we are working to overcome these issues.  Supply is a key issue and supply is increasing.  Notwithstanding the challenges, the Central Bank's recent estimates of completions this year and next are in line with Housing for All targets.  This trend will only accelerate in coming years.  Positive figures for new homes completed and commenced, which were all higher than they have been for many years, indicate Housing for All is working.  Over the past four quarters, 22,219 homes were delivered, 5,569 in the first quarter of this year, while 34,846 new homes were commenced in the 12 months to March 2022.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, policies are being implemented to assist those for whom affordability and home ownership are particularly challenging.  As we have said before, the Government believes that in home ownership we must use all tools at our disposal.  The Affordable Housing Act passed overwhelmingly by this House last year laid foundations for a range of affordable housing schemes which like cost rental and the local authority affordable purchase scheme are now either already in operation or, like the first home scheme, very close to launch.  With regard to recent reports which under-represented our affordable housing targets in referring singularly to local authority-led affordable housing, I want to reconfirm that this Government aims through the multiple channels it has activated to provide more than 28,000 affordable homes by the end of 2026.<\/p> <p> Looking at the full picture, affordable housing will be provided through a combination of more than 7,500 homes provided directly across at least 18 local authority areas where affordable housing has been clearly determined.  I stress that these targets are intended as a baseline for delivery that is led and arranged by local authorities.  It will be further provided through 8,000 homes under the first home affordable purchase shared equity scheme which will be available nationwide in the period 2022 to 2026; 7,800 affordable purchase and cost-rental homes through the Land Development Agency delivered on State lands via Project Tosaigh.  Some 1,500 affordable homes under Part V arrangements are targeted for delivery by local authorities.  Some 4,000 cost-rental homes to rent are to be provided by approved housing bodies using the cost rental equity loan facility.<\/p> <p> The local authority home loan and the help to buy scheme will also continue to help improve affordability for lower and middle income earners, allowing them to access home ownership in a way that otherwise they could not.  This year, funding of &euro;676 million has been made available specifically on affordability measures.  A guaranteed &euro;20 billion in State investment in housing will be made available to the end of 2025.  The new national first home scheme to assist affordable purchases in the lower end of the price distribution of the private market is an example of a short-term, limited intervention.  It is carefully designed to mitigate inflationary risk while helping people to achieve the stability of home ownership over the next four years.  With the State's &euro;200 million investment doubled by strategic partnership with mortgage lenders, first home is scheduled to be launched shortly.<\/p> <p> I must re-emphasise our strong commitment to the State in action through public channels.  Locally affordable housing delivery is also being placed on a more strategic footing.  Local authorities with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to prepare affordable housing delivery action plans.  In doing so, they take into account the intended provision of affordable housing by the Land Development Agency and approved housing bodies and assess the level of affordable demand in their area and arrange provision accordingly.  Their plans are currently being finalised and it is expected that they will be ready for publication in the coming months.  The targets for each local authority are aligned with the level of need arising in those areas as determined by the housing need and demand assessment tool which was developed in co-operation with the ESRI.  Where local authorities such as Waterford, for example, have identified a demand and can secure delivery of a high number of affordable homes in their area, that affordable housing fund supported delivery is welcome.  For those local authorities without affordability targets, we are aware that localised affordability challenges can exist in key towns.  Where this occurs, funding can be made available if needed to address those localised challenges.<\/p> <p> I am very happy to see that local authority delivery this year for the first time in well over a decade.  The first such homes are being advertised and sold in Cork city, Fingal and south Dublin at significantly discounted prices with more new homes to follow across the country later this year.  A pipeline of delivery is being developed by local authorities with nine further schemes expected to go on-site in 2022.  Local authorities are also implementing the State's offering of long-term, low-cost mortgage credit with the home loans being designed to be particularly accessible for single people and those eligible for fresh start principles.  <\/p> <p> Overall, I am not discounting the very real challenges that ordinary people are facing.  The outlook is more positive than might be presenting.  The Housing for All strategy is working.  Supply is increasing and, in particular, affordable schemes are being implemented to assist ordinary people into home ownership.  In its amendment to the motion, the Government reflects these realities and I hope makes clear its commitment to the core principle that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent.  We have progressed much already and there is a long way to go.  We are moving in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000047#VV00400","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652213400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I see around the county of Kerry from Tousist to Tarbert to Tureencahill and over to Ceann Tr&aacute; the results, the problems and the fallout of current and previous Government policy over the past ten years.  I see queues of 30 to 40 people seeking to rent a home.  It is practically impossible to rent.  Homelessness is on the increase.  Vacant homes are not being turned around fast enough.  Compulsory purchase orders to get housing back into use are practically non-existent.  People are waiting on the housing list for 15 years.  The decision to outsource social housing to the market ten years ago in tandem, I believe, with the abolition of the town councils of Tralee, Listowel and Killarney, was a disaster.  I also see the lack of sewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment.  In places like Glenbeigh, Castlegregory, Abbeydorney and Fenit people cannot build two houses together because of the lack of any water system.<\/p><p>At the other end, people cannot afford to purchase houses.  It is hardly surprising when figures from the CSO tell us that house prices in the south-west region rose 15.4%.  In 2020, house prices in Kerry increased more than in any other county.  The <i>daft.ie<\/i>report paints a similar picture, with prices in Kerry up 7.5% for a one-bedroom apartment, 14.2% for a two-bedroom terraced house and 18.1% for a three-bed semi-detached house.  As a result, in 2021 house prices in Kenmare and Dingle were up 10%, in Tralee they were up 15% and in Killarney they were up by a staggering 18.5%.  <\/p><p>Government responses are overly reliant on a subsidy to developers, increasing inflation even before the current inflation crisis.  The shared equity scheme should be abandoned.  I know people who went into the last one and after 20 years they still only own half their home.  A builder recently presented me with a folder of price increases from builders' providers with near monthly increases across the board from providers.  In housing both finance and purchase, increasingly provided by private capital looking for a return, price increases are built into Government policy.  Ordinary people are struggling, especially those who availed of the personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, and who sold their homes in negative equity.  They cannot avail of the fresh start scheme, which is only open to those who have availed of statutory insolvency schemes.

The price of homes keeps going up while the available income for many families keeps going down due to inflation.  Large numbers of people are being locked out of home ownership and the efforts of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address this have been woeful.  On a daily basis my constituency office in Limerick receives calls of desperation from people who have been locked out of home ownership.  These are people who struggle to save a deposit.  They are not fortunate enough to avail of a cash injection from their parents.  They are trying to buy their own home and the lack of support from the Government for them is galling.  Is it any wonder that average-income families or new couples struggle to get into the housing market?  In Limerick the average price of a house purchase has risen by 8.2% year-on-year.  For young families, a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Limerick will cost on average 10.3% more than it did this time last year, with the average price of such units starting at &euro;212,000.  In some of the most sought-after suburbs, the price of a three-bedroom terraced house is almost a quarter of a million euro.  Average-income families are caught between a rock and a hard place.  On one hand they are locked out of purchasing their own home while on the other they earn too much to avail of council-supplied housing or support through the HAP scheme.  Social housing income thresholds have not been changed since 2011.  This is something that should be rectified.  The income cut-off levels need to be increased to reflect inflation.<\/p><p>All the while, house prices go up.  According to <i>daft.ie<\/i>we now have seven consecutive quarters of house prices increasing.  Coupled with that we see the number of new homes available at its lowest level since January 2017.  Prices are going up while supply is decreasing.  This is happening on the watch of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  It is happening because Government policy such as help to buy and shared equity inflate house prices.  This should come as no shock to anybody.  It has been forewarned that this would be the outcome.  It is recognised that there is a lack of local authority affordable housing yet the Minister seems to pick his delivery targets out of thin air.  Using Limerick as an example, the local authority affordable housing delivery targets for 2022 to 2026 stand at 264 units or 52 per year.<\/p> <p>There are more than 2,200 people on the housing list in Limerick, with a further 344 awaiting a transfer.  The Minister's unambitious targets will have next to no impact on these housing figures.  People are now desperate across Limerick.  Generations of families are living in the same homes because the rent is too high and the purchasing of a social house is out of reach.  The Minister, therefore, has to step up to the plate with solutions.  We need to revise the affordable purchase home targets because they are insufficient.  Local authorities must be allowed to access an affordable housing fund.  Income thresholds for social housing support must be dramatically increased, and the failed shared equity loan and help-to-buy schemes need to be dumped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000048#WW00300","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652214000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I would like to put on the record my response to a number of factually incorrect claims that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, made in his contribution earlier.  As always, it is a pity that he has not remained until the end of the debate.  However, as usual we are more than happy that the Minister of State is present.<\/p>  <p>  First, the Minister criticised the figures upon which this motion is based.  He said in the response to the parliamentary question that there is also a reference to the possible delivery of affordable purchase homes by the LDA and Part V arrangements.  The problem is that the overwhelming majority of counties listed in the parliamentary question will not have any LDA homes because the agency is precluded from being active in those areas.  In those local authority areas where the LDA is active, very few affordable purchase homes will be delivered until 2024 or 2025.  Even at that, we do not know whether they will be affordable.  Therefore, to say there is an as yet unquantified number of affordable purchase homes related to the LDA is simply incorrect.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister well knows that the changes to Part V of the Planning and Development Act apply only to land purchased this year and, therefore, if the land is purchased this year, it is unlikely there will be a planning application until next year, which means the homes will not be delivered for two to three years thereafter.  Again, no affordable purchase homes are likely to be delivered during the lifetime of this Government via the changes to Part V.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to remember that a significant number of homes listed in the reply to the parliamentary question will not be affordable at all.  Those at O'Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Road and Donabate are good examples in that the all-in cost of an affordable home, or the full price that a hard-working family will have to pay, will be in excess of &euro;400,000, taking into account the initial purchase price and the shared equity loan repayment.  This is hardly what the Minister and I, if we were being honest with each other, would call affordable.<\/p>  <p>  The suggestion that the shared equity loan scheme delivers affordable housing is absolutely ludicrous because the product can in fact be used to buy properties with a value up to &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000.  Those are not affordable homes, and the Minister knows that only too well.<\/p>  <p>  He also criticised what he said was Sinn F&eacute;in's threadbare housing policy.  Of course, he does this all the time.  He waved a summary document I had sent him number some years ago that was based not only on extensive policy proposition documents but also on draft circulars and alternative, fully costed budgets for various years.  Again, it is very disingenuous of him to do that.<\/p>  <p>  He repeated the claim that the Government is investing &euro;4 billion in public housing this year; it is not true.  In this regard, we should look at the budget book the Minister for Finance announced in this Chamber last October.  The total direct capital investment by the State, local authorities and AHBs is just under &euro;1.5 billion, only &euro;100 million more than the year before.  Our proposal is to double direct capital investment by the State up to approximately &euro;3 billion for the direct delivery of social and genuinely affordable homes.  The Minister is correct that the numbers of completions and commencements are higher, we discussed this last week, but completions are up only to meet this year's target, namely 24,000 homes.  It is nowhere close to the 40,000 homes we need.  Of the 24,000 that will be delivered, how many will be genuinely affordable?  How many will even be for sale on the open market?  Far, far too few.<\/p>  <p>  It is the same with commencements because an increasing number of apartment developments will take two to three years to complete and, therefore, the Government could well be out of office before any of the expected changes occur.<\/p>  <p>  Probably the most disingenuous thing the Minister did was criticise Sinn F&eacute;in's affordable housing proposal.  Once again, he misrepresented it.  Let me repeat: we have a very specific and innovative proposal for affordable purchase that would ensure not only that a property is affordable to its first purchaser but also to every subsequent purchaser.  It is very simple.  You buy the house and it is yours to do what you want with, but you will not have been sold the public land.  You can use the land for free indefinitely, as can your children and grandchildren, so long as it is not rented out to the private rental sector.  When you sell it, you must sell it to another affordable-home purchaser.  The price is index-linked for inflation and accounts for home improvements.  This way, we would build up tens of thousands of privately owned and privately tradeable, but permanently affordable, homes.  This is an eminently sensible idea.<\/p>  <p>  The problem is that the Government simply does not understand the depth of the crisis.  It is not investing enough, and the targets in the Minister's reply to the parliamentary question demonstrate that clearly, which is why I stand over this motion.  I stand over the call to double capital investment to deliver 20,000 public homes per year, and particularly 4,000 genuinely affordable homes for working families year on year from now until 2026.  Anything short of that is not acceptable, and that is why we will not support the Government's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000049#XX00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652214000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652214000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Wednesday, 11 May 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000049#XX00400","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna ar Sonra\u00edodh Uain D\u00f3ibh - Priority Questions","time":1652214000,"counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000049#XX00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","time":1652214000,"counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000049#XX00600"},{"type":"question","time":1652214000,"counter":372,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[23370\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000049#XX00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of the current situation in respect of passport applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1652214000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>There is currently a great demand for passports, which is no surprise given the two years of Covid, during which people were not able to travel.

A total of 117,000 passports were issued in April alone, with 45% of adult renewal passports being issued within one to two working days. <\/p>  <p>  It is stated there are currently 183,000 applications in the passport service system but I believe it is now closer to 190,000.  I checked just before I came in.  While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog.  These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that as we approach the summer months, people will be thinking about going on holidays and renewing their passports.  While I strongly urge everyone to apply for a passport in plenty of time, the urgent-appointment service is available for customers who wish to renew their passports at short notice.  Customers availing of this service can renew a passport within one to four days in Dublin and within four days in Cork.  Almost 5,000 customers have availed of this service since January of this year. <\/p>  <p>  It is a priority for the passport service to improve processing times in 2022, particularly for first-time applicants, for whom I know there has been an issue.  The passport service is implementing several further measures that will positively affect current turnaround times and further improve customer service, including working targeted overtime to focus on key areas such as first-time applications, intensive training of staff and enhanced public information resources.  I am confident that the measures implemented will continue to help to reduce passport turnaround times in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000049#XX00900","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1652214000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>There are serious problems, particularly for first-time applicants, as the Minister acknowledged, but also those seeking children's passports.

This includes the event launch, promotional material and campaign-related travel and subsistence.  These costs compare favourably with those of our competitors.  Norway, for example, spent &euro;2.8 million on its campaign.  Canada, which we beat in that process, spent &euro;1.5 million.\u00a0  Estonia, which served on the Security Council from 2020 to 2021, spent &euro;1.5 million on its campaign.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Membership of the Security Council brings with it a significantly increased workload.  The breadth and depth of the agenda has increased considerably since Ireland was last a member in 2001-02, and this requires a substantial contribution right across the Department.  The additional workload is most notable at headquarters in Dublin and at our Permanent Mission to the UN in New York.  Ireland&rsquo;s embassy network also plays a central role, engaging with Governments and reporting on their approach to Council agenda items.  Staffing has been significantly increased in New York, in headquarters and in a number of embassies.  A dedicated Security Council task team in Dublin leads in coordinating our approach to all Security Council and UN issues.<\/p>  <p>  Our tenure has involved some additional expenditure, including on salaries, premises, travel, meetings and other events.  In New York, eight additional diplomatic officers, three attach&eacute;s from the Department of Defence and 13 locally hired staff are working on Security Council issues, and they also cover other duties.  Additional staff have also been allocated to the political division and development co-operation and Africa division at headquarters, as well as to key embassies in Africa and the Middle East.  The Department&rsquo;s allocated budget for the costs of Ireland&rsquo;s UN Security Council tenure is &euro;4 million in 2021 and 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Travel costs include participation by New York-based staff in UN-sanctioned committee visits to countries subject to arms embargoes and targeted sanctions, as well as travel by headquarter-based staff to countries on the agenda on the Security Council and for consultations with other Security Council members, and some travel between Dublin and New York.  These increased resources help to ensure that Ireland can participate fully as a member of the Security Council and that we are properly informed in order that we can be as impactful as possible.

Effectively, Ireland was the penholder on that file on the Security Council, ensuring that others noticed the extraordinary events that were happening in Ethiopia last year in terms of violence and a civil war that was developing there.  In respect of Afghanistan, we have been, and continue to be, extremely vocal on women, peace and security issues.  We were extremely active in trying to assist many journalists to get out of Afghanistan and come to Ireland.  We work directly on getting humanitarian assistance into north-west Syria.

His question indicates he is primarily concerned with first-time passports, which is the process that is taking longer at the moment.  Since March of this year, the passport service has reduced the processing time for first-time applications from 40 working days to 30.  This 25% reduction in processing times is a direct result of the substantial level of investment my Department has made in the service.\u00a0 It is important to note that the reduction in turnaround times for first-time applications took effect from 19 April.  Only fully complete applications submitted on or after that date can be processed within 30 days.<\/p>  <p>  First-time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this.  First-time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship.  The passport service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm his or her entitlement to Irish citizenship.  It is the statutory responsibility of the passport service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport.  Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first-time applicants.  In the case of first-time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated.  Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first-time applications take 30 working days to process.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 88,000 first-time online applications in the system.  Of these, 57% are complete and being processed by the Passport Office.  The other 43% require additional action by the applicant or his or her parent.  This means applicants need to submit required documentation such as a witnessed guardian consent form  to progress the application.\u00a0 I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports in plenty of time.<\/p>  <p>  My time is up but I will come back on the Deputy's suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000052#AAA01100","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1652215800,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The staff have been very helpful to me in dealing with very difficult times for families in the past number of years.<\/p>  <p>  What is being done to ensure first-time passports are issued within a reasonable timeframe?  There are families who are given an estimated issue date and who book a holiday, perhaps for a week later, only to be told after the estimated issue date that there is a problem with the application.  Surely such notice can be given at an earlier stage rather than at the final stage?  I dealt with a family of five who were supposed to go on holiday last week, with the baby's passport to be issued on 5 May.  The parents found out there was an issue on 6 May, which meant they had to leave the baby at home.  It was okay for that family because there was somebody to look after the child but it is not an ideal situation.  The staff in my office are pulling the hair out of their heads because, like the staff of every other politician, they are inundated with calls and are spending 45 minutes on the telephone waiting for a reply.

There is an issue with people applying for a first-time passport for a child, getting an estimated delivery date, booking holidays and then later finding there is a problem with the application.  We are trying to address this by making sure the clock does not start again after applicants correct their paperwork or give the extra information needed.  Instead, we now prioritise corrected applications for conclusion within 15 days, provided the new paperwork is correct.  We made that change because of what Oireachtas Members have said to me in trying to improve the efficiency of the system.

The provision of euro-denominated bank notes to Belarus is also prohibited.

I met virtually with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 5 May, the day of the Assembly elections, to discuss a number of issues in that important context.  Following the results of the elections in Northern Ireland, I spoke with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Saturday to discuss the outcomes of the elections and the need for both Governments to work in support of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.

The British Prime Minister and the British Government have signalled that they intend to break international law and to introduce legislation of their own to set aside elements of the protocol.  That is a complete breach of faith.  It will undermine partnership, which is essential for trying to resolve these issues.  It is also undemocratic, in my view.  Some 53 of the 90 MLAs who were elected in the elections support the protocol and if they were to vote in the morning on the retention of the protocol, they would vote \"Yes\".  Of course, there are issues to be resolved, and there is a large unionist community that is very concerned about the implications of the protocol and its implementation, but the way to resolve those issues is through partnership, not illegal unilateral action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000055#DDD00600","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1652217600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I am opposed to illegal unilateral action.

I will arrange to have the figures requested by the Deputies on passport applications from counties Dublin, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Galway and Donegal shared directly with them following this session.\u00a0 Applications from various counties are distributed for processing across the three passport offices in Dublin and Cork on the basis of the type of application rather than county of residence of the applicant.  Passport application turnaround times are the same for all citizens regardless of county or, indeed, country of residence.<\/p>  <p>  The passport service recently reduced its turnaround time on first-time passports from 40 working days to 30.  This is a significant reduction given the unprecedented volume of applications being received.  The passport service is focused on reducing this processing time even further in the coming months.\u00a0 The\u00a0service\u00a0is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children.  There are currently 88,000 online first-time applications in the system.  The service has issued over 400,000 passports to date in 2022.  To put this number in context, 634,000 passports were issued in total in 2021.  In four months, up to the end of April, the service has issued over 63% of the total number of passports issued last year.  Demand for passports continues to be very high with unprecedented levels of applications continuing to be received.\u00a0 Over 130,000 applications were received in April alone.<\/p>  <p>  Passport service figures show that of the total number of passport applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the service.  The other 39% of applications are incomplete, which means the service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required.  While the service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, its experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.  Applications that are incomplete cannot be processed within the average turnaround times.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish passport was recently ranked fifth in the Henley Global Passport Index because it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.  This is something we can all be proud of.  However, in order to maintain this ranking and to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the\u00a0passport service\u00a0must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant's entitlement to Irish citizenship.  This is particularly important in the case of first-time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  The resourcing of the service to respond to current demand for passports is a priority for my Department, which has been working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive.  Since June 2021, more than 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the passport service.  In addition, the service is running its own recruitment competition for temporary clerical officers with a view to assigning additional staff.  Interviews have concluded and candidates are currently undergoing Garda vetting.  Following the clearance process, the service will appoint 150 temporary clerical officers and will see staffing numbers increase to more than 900.  This represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.\u00a0 These increased staffing levels will be maintained right throughout the year to ensure that demand for passports, particularly first-time applications, is met.<\/p>  <p>  There is an ongoing process of\u00a0reform\u00a0within the\u00a0passport service.  This process has delivered a number of transformational improvements for citizens at home and abroad, in particular the roll-out of the Passport Online service.  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first-time applications, are now being made through Passport Online.  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the passport service.  All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.\u00a0 Passport Online can be accessed by all first-time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, all EU member states and most other countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US.  The Passport Online service recently expanded for first-time applicants in South Africa, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mauritius, Lesotho, Colombia, Panama, Chile, Peru and Ecuador.  The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to four times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p>  <p>  The next major\u00a0reform\u00a0under way is the replacement of the core technology underpinning the\u00a0passport service.  The current system, which was launched in 2004, will be replaced by a more modern and integrated system.  This complex project is currently at an early stage and officials from my Department are actively working with the vendor to outline the high-level design of the new system.  Extensive detailed design, testing and phased implementation is to follow over the remainder of this year and much of 2023.  It is intended that the new system will be substantially operational by the end of 2023.  This will ensure the\u00a0passport service\u00a0benefits from a standard, scalable and resilient technical platform capable of handling increased application volumes while maintaining the high standards of security that constitute the hallmark of the Irish passport.  I know this is a long reply but I am trying to give as much information as possible to the House regarding the complexity of the system.  I am happy to take any further questions Deputies may have.<\/p> <p>We have five supplementary questions, at a minute each, starting with Deputy Lahart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000057#FFF01000","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652219400,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's reply and I want to acknowledge the sterling work being done by officials in the Department, under immense pressure, to deal with the conveyor belt of applications coming in.

It is really busy and sometimes there are interruptions in the system, as there have been over the past few days and when that happens and the public cannot get through on the lines, they contact their local Deputy, understandably, because they need to find out what is happening with their passport application.  We are trying to keep those interruptions to a minimum, where possible.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue with improving the verification process between the Passport Office and Garda stations.  It is a particular issue in rural communities where Garda stations are not open for many hours a day.  That is an issue the Department discussed today because a number of people have raised it.  That said, I must emphasise that we are not doing this for the sake of it.  There is a fraud issue relating to passports and there are risks around child abduction.  We have to make sure that when we issue a passport for a child, we know who the parents are and we have verification of that from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is really important.  When the passport system is under pressure, that is when there will be fraud and criminal activity, with people trying to get passports inappropriately.

This should be welcomed but, as it has gone ahead now, it will have a disastrous effect in rural communities as no local commercial operator - better known to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and myself as the private service operator - can avail of the 20% or the 50% deductions.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il with the Minister as soon as he announced the 20% decrease in early April but he still railroaded ahead with it, wiping every private service operator off this decrease and leaving many of their struggling businesses with an uphill battle to survive.<\/p>  <p>  The local commercial operators, as we all know, were still reeling from the shock when the Minister announced in the past two weeks that he is railroading ahead with a 50% decrease for students and young people&rsquo;s travel.  Again, this is something to be welcomed, as many would say, but the Minister put nothing in place for the private operator to pass on this decrease to the students, mainly in rural Ireland, saying there are technical and funding issues preventing him from doing so.  This 50% decrease will benefit those who travel on Bus &Eacute;ireann, Luas, the train, DART and Dublin Bus, all Dublin city-type transport, which I do not begrudge.  However, a private operator like West Cork Connect, which carries 80% of the passengers on west Cork routes, has buses leaving Skibbereen and Bantry every hour, on the hour, every day, passing through Clonakilty and Bandon to Cork on one side, and from Dunmanway and Ballineen to Inishannon to Cork and back on the other side, a service, I may add, which has opened up west Cork.  This local commercial operator is employing a huge number of staff in west Cork but is not allowed to pass on the recent 20% or proposed 50% decreases to west Cork students.  It is not just putting his business in jeopardy, but also Wexford Bus, Cobh Connect, Aircoach, Go Bus and Citylink, which are all facing the same wipeout.<\/p>  <p>  This is another gaffe by the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  On top of that, it is a direct hit on the young people and rural communities who totally depend on private operators to connect their communities.  The Minister for Transport, with the aid of the Government, simply wants to wipe out the private bus operators, or that is the way they feel anyway.  Unlike Bus &Eacute;ireann, Luas, DART, Dublin Bus and the train, they have to pay their staff and pay for their fuel and for the wear and tear on their vehicles.  Instead of encouraging them with a so-called Connecting Ireland dream, the Government is going to completely disconnect transport in rural Ireland because many of these operators are going to go out of business as a result.<\/p>  <p>  Why was what should have been such a positive announcement by this anti-rural Government held off until everyone, rural and urban, could avail of this decrease?  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, knows of this bias he has created.  This Government decision will see private bus companies being forced out of business by State-backed cuts and now leaves them contemplating taking legal action.  Not alone is this unfair but it is anti-competitive as well.  Why can the Minister for Transport not get this right?  Will the Government step in now and treat everyone in rural Ireland and urban Ireland the same when it comes to the decrease in fares for our youth?<\/p>  <p>  The company West Cork Connect is now struggling to survive.  That operator is providing a service that no one ever provided in west Cork before and no one ever will touch it again if he walks away from this.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, met him and told him that when he gave the 20% decrease, he could not pass it on to private companies because he could not afford it and then, three or four weeks later, he announces a 50% decrease.  I cannot understand where the money came from, all of a sudden.  This West Cork Connect operator, as I said, is up against it because of these cuts being given to public transport and not to him.  He is also being moved from his parking space on St. Patrick's Quay in Cork city, which is going to be a disaster for him going forward.  That is another issue on which I would appreciate an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000059#HHH00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1652220000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, for being here to deal with the fourth item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000059#HHH00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1652220000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for raising this important topic, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question is in regard to the extension of the recently introduced 20% fare reduction initiative on public transport services to include private transport operators.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system in Ireland.  They play a pivotal role, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public bus and rail services.  In recognition of this important role, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports through the Covid-19 pandemic with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport system.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these financial supports were extended earlier this year up until 30 June 2022.  To date, almost &euro;60 million of State funding has been provided to support commercial bus operators during what has been a challenging time as transport demand patterns evolved in response to the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the 20% fare reduction initiative, it is important to highlight that this measure was introduced as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living.  The Government allocated &euro;54 million in Exchequer funding to support this transport initiative.  The fare reduction was rolled out to public service obligation, PSO, services outside the greater Dublin area from 11 April and nationwide from 9 May.  These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public service transport every day in 2022.  The fare reduction is funded until the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  However, the funding allocation does not include an extension of the scheme to commercial operators.  Unlike with PSO services, the National Transport Authority, NTA, does not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators.  The operators themselves set fares on their services based on their own commercial judgment.  While it is not currently intended to include the commercial operators as part of the 20% average fare reduction initiative, it has always been the Minister's intention to include these operators as part of the longer-term young adult card initiative announced as part of budget 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the importance of incentivising more young people to use public transport, funding was secured to provide for the introduction of the young adult card on both PSO and commercial services.  This measure will allow any person nationwide between the ages of 19 and 23 years to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services.  The young adult card was launched on PSO services at the start of this week, with more than 1,000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone.  The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.<\/p>  <p>  The time lag is due to the fact it is technically more challenging to roll out fare initiatives such as the young adult card on the commercial bus network than it is on the Leap-enabled PSO network.  An array of various ticketing equipment is in use on fleet used by commercial operators and needs to be catered for.  To expedite the process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and to develop a plan to implement the young adult card in as timely a manner as possible.  Such fare initiatives will be of great benefit to the public transport user and will promote a modal shift into the transport sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000059#HHH00500","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1652220000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply but she cannot talk about Covid-19 supports because, in fairness to these operators, most of them had to take eight or ten passengers, so they were in an absolutely dire situation at that time.<\/p> <p>Supports are good at any time.  I respect that but it cannot be seen as those supports carrying operators over for the remainder of their lives.  The bottom line is that it is very obvious what is happening.  The Minister for Transport is wiping out private service operators.  That is how they tell me they feel.  Outside of Dublin, the local commercial bus operators are the biggest operators in the country.  They carry out 30 million passenger trips yearly. <\/p> <p> In a recent meeting with the Minister for Transport the private operators asked a straight-up question as to why were they not included in the 20% bus fare decrease for the youth on their buses.  They were told by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, that it was for financial reasons that he could not go ahead.  To their astonishment, a few weeks later, he announced a 50% decrease and again exempted them.  Where did this Minister find the money that he did not have a few weeks earlier?  Was it carbon tax money robbed from the hard-working people of rural Ireland?<\/p> <p> It is no disrespect to the Minister of State, because she is doing whatever is asked of her, but it is a disgrace that the Minister is not here to answer straight-up questions and give us a date that the private service operators, who carry more than 50% of bus passengers in Ireland, can pass on the 20% or 50% decrease to their customers.  If he does not, he will be the cause of disconnecting public transport in rural Ireland, as is happening already.<\/p> <p> It is an attack on our youth.  This is a great idea.  I have no objection whatsoever to passing on a 20% or 50% deduction to the people who travel on the DART or the Luas.  I wish them the very best of luck.  We should be delighted for them but if it is good enough to pass it on to them, it is good enough to pass it on to the people of rural Ireland, whether they are in west Cork, Mayo or Wexford.  The Minister of Transport has failed in his duty to do so because he cannot see outside the Pale.  It is Dublin or nothing.  That is what is happening here.  The private operator will go out of business and we cannot afford to allow that happen in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000059#HHH00600","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652220600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Time is up.

To date, 23 meetings have taken place.  More recently on 25 March, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, met with the CTTC to discuss its concerns and the key issues facing the sector.  While it is not intended to include the commercial operators as part of the 20% average fare reduction initiative, which is due to run to the end of 2022, it is intended to include these operators as part of the long-term young adult initiative.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA is working closely with operators in order to achieve this shared goal as quickly as possible.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, in order to roll out the card across the commercial bus sector, time is needed to make the necessary changes to the wide array of ticketing systems employed across the network.  The NTA has advised that the intensive technical work to achieve this objective is currently under way.  It is hoped that the young adult card initiative will be expanded to include the commercial bus sector by the end of the summer.<\/p>  <p>  Initiatives such as the young adult card and the 20% average reduction on public service obligation fares mean that 2022 looks set to be an exciting year for public transport provision throughout the country as we slowly return to pre-pandemic travels.  I trust this clarifies some of the questions that the Deputy has raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051000060#JJJ00400","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652220600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar athl&oacute; ar 10.33 p.m. go dt&iacute; 9.12 a.m., D&eacute; C&eacute;adaoin, an 11 Bealtaine 2022.\r\n\r\nThe D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.33 p.m. until 9.12 a.m. on Wednesday, 11 May 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
