Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a disease that would not be very widely known yet about 500 people in Ireland suffer from it.  It is a soft tissue disease where patients suffer a lot of pain and where their joints might be rubbing off each other.  Many children have been diagnosed with this disease.  I spoke to the chairperson of the representative group in Ireland.  I arranged a meeting between the Minister for Health and some people with this disease during a visit to Limerick earlier this year.  I know the Minister took a note and was very aware of the different issues.  I know he has had a meeting with the HSE with regard to it but there are a number of issues relating to the disease.<\/p><p>A main one is that there is no doctor in the country who can diagnose the disease fully or sign off on it in terms of the cross-border directive.  If the patient has to have an MRI, it must be an upright MRI but there is no upright MRI scanner in Ireland.  Patients must go to Belfast or London.  The scan costs about &euro;2,000 and is not covered under anything in the current system so people must pay for it privately if they want to have the operation, which many of them must have.  I know a young girl who had the operation in Barcelona earlier in the year and has had to go back twice since then.  The family fundraised for this operation because the girl was in such pain.  She was 14 years of age.  There are many more cases like that.<\/p><p>While it is recognised, there is nobody available to sign off on cases and there is no specified neurologist.  Many children with the condition are on a waiting list of about two and a half years to see the neurologist at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  There are many issues and there is a considerable amount of pain, not just the pain the child or adult with the condition goes through but the pain their families go through.  I know of a few adults with the condition.  I know one family where the mother and her son have the condition.  Patients and their families experience a considerable amount of pain and cost.  I would like an update regarding what is happening with the HSE and what it will do for the people with this condition.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121200002#A00500","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1544610600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am grateful to Senator Byrne for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is classified as a rare disease, which is defined in the EU as a disease or disorder affecting fewer than five in 10,000 of the European population.  Although each disease is individually rare, there are a great many conditions and diseases.  Collectively, rare diseases contribute to a number of important population health outcomes in terms of their mortality, morbidity and disability.  I will take this opportunity to summarise policy development in the area of rare diseases.<\/p><p>Ireland published a national plan for rare diseases in July 2014.  On foot of the plan, the HSE established both a rare disease office and a national clinical programme for rare diseases.  In 2017, the Department published a progress report and update on all 48 recommendations contained in the national plan representing a detailed status update of the implementation of the national plan.<\/p><p>It is important to note that this syndrome is not one condition but a group of connective tissue disorders that can be inherited and can vary both in how they affect the body and in their genetic causes.  They are generally characterised by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility.  The condition has a relatively high prevalence of one in 5,000 of the population.<\/p><p>Once diagnosed, joint hypermobility syndrome can be treated with a mixture of exercise and physiotherapy.  An exercise programme to improve fitness and muscle strength may also be effective at reducing pain.  Hypermobility of the joints is the most common form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and requires management by physiotherapy and primary care but does not usually need specialist input.  However, the nature of joint hypermobility syndrome also means that patients are at increased risk of injuries, such as dislocations and soft tissue injuries.  Managing joint hypermobility may, therefore, involve treating short-term injuries as they arise while following a long-term treatment plan to manage daily symptoms.<\/p><p>The more severe forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome require specialist treatment, often by multiple specialists working as part of a multidisciplinary team but usually under the lead care of the specialist for the most severely affected part of the body.  These specialists can include geneticists, rheumatologists, cardiologists, neurologists and surgeons.  Where surgery is required, it is provided for in the context of surgical and orthopaedic services for patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  These most severe cases of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are rare and are usually managed by specialists at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.<\/p><p>I am advised by the HSE that the total number of patients with severe Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is in the order of 20 to 40 patients nationally.  The paediatric consultant rheumatologists in Ireland based at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin have specialist training in the management of all types of rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders and have access to other relevant consultant specialists needed for the care of those with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jim Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2328\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2328&amp;amp;pid=JimDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Patients and their families trying to find information on what supports, treatments and services are available can contact the rare diseases office in the HSE.<\/p><p>Regarding recent developments, I am very glad to inform the House that the national clinical programme for rheumatology recently launched its model of care for rheumatology in Ireland.  The aim of this model is to ensure that the rheumatology patient is seen, assessed and treated by the right person in the right place as soon as possible.  Based on this model of care, the national clinical programme for rheumatology, NCPR, plans to develop disease-specific pathways for all rheumatological disease groups, which will incorporate patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, in the context of how these patients often present with joint hypermobility.  The next steps, following publication, are for the HSE, as part of its service planning and prioritisation processes, to provide a national rheumatology service which delivers evidence-based care in an efficient, cost-effective manner and is readily accessible to all patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121200002#A00600","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544610600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I am disappointed, not with the Minister but with the response.  First, there is a two and a half year long waiting list for these children and the adults involved.  This is not addressed in the response from the HSE.  Second, they need an upright MRI scan to be recognised.  As I said, it is reckoned there are approximately 500 people in Ireland, between adults and children, with different levels of severity of the condition.  As stated in the response, these people are treated collectively by different consultants but there is no one who deals specifically with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  As a result, there is no one qualified to sign off on permission for people to be covered under the cross-border directive.  These people must go abroad for the operation because there is no one in Ireland qualified to perform it.  This is not covered in the response either.  These are two crucial issues.  What happens a lot of the time is that when the children go into hospital, and many of them have gone into the local hospitals, the neurologist or whoever else is not trained to deal with the severity of the pain of these children.  The pain they go through is sometimes quite excruciating.<\/p><p>We need someone who knows something about this.  I know it is a rare disease but we must deal with it because the numbers with the disease are growing.  Perhaps a neurologist who is sent on a course could deal with it specifically and with the people affected.  It is terrible to think that people have to go abroad for their treatment and that there is no one here to sign off on this treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121200002#B00200","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1544610600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator again.

I see no benefit, from the perspective of people in the United Kingdom, Ireland or the European Union, in the Prime Minister being replaced by someone else at this stage.

Mr. Major spoke in Longford on Monday at an event marking 25 years of the Downing Street Declaration.  That is something on which the House may wish to reflect.  We marked 20 years of the Good Friday Agreement, and it was important that we did so, but the work Albert Reynolds and John Major did in 1993 to secure the Downing Street Declaration was also important and we should remember it.  I also attended an event organised by the Institute of International and European Affairs at which John Major stated the UK should revoke Article 50, stop the clock, return to the start and examine what should and must be done.

We also need proportionality.  We need to consider the idea of targeting repeat offenders differently from people who are caught for the first time.  For instance, the case of someone caught speeding by a detection van in a transition zone where the speed limit changes quickly from 120 km\/h to 50 or 60 km\/h is slightly different from somebody caught travelling at 180 km\/h on a motorway.  There are also very different road conditions.  There are speed limits of 60 km\/h on the Stillorgan dual carriageway, yet many rural roads have speed limits of 80 km\/h.  We need proper speed limits and we must consider proportionality and how much people can afford to pay in fines.  In Finland and Sweden, fines are based on earnings, which means those with a lot of money are hit more than those with very little money.  That is not to say that people on small incomes should be speeding but income should be taken into consideration.  Much can be done on speeds.  As Senator Paddy Burke said, in ten years we will have driverless cars and all kinds of technology keeping an eye on us.  However, one would hardly be caught speeding in Dublin because one can hardly get around the place.

I refer to the ESRI report released yesterday showing that low-income households stand to lose most from the budget in 2019.  The institute predicts that all household incomes will be down by 0.6% on average.  Yet, higher income households will benefit from the USC charges and the changes to income tax.  If we put that into context with what we found out in the finance committee last week, the real priority for the Government become clear.  Glenbeigh Securities, the vehicle used to transfer up to 6,000 mortgages from Permanent TSB, will not pay any tax at all because of how it is set up as a special purpose vehicle under section 110.  We have been told by the Government time and again that all loopholes allowing vulture funds to avoid paying taxes have been closed.  It took nine rounds of direct questioning from my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, to get Permanent TSB to admit that the reason the bank will continue to hold the 5% interest was to avoid the main vehicle paying tax.  That is absolutely disgraceful.  We also learned that the selling off of the mortgages without agreement is against the code of conduct from the Central Bank.  Yesterday, we learned that the Irish Nationwide senior manager responsible for commercial lending was fined &euro;23,000 for reckless conduct.  That cost this country &euro;5.4 billion from Irish Nationwide alone.  People need to wake up and see what is happening here.  It is always the little person who is being screwed over.  We are paying reverence to banks and institutions.  Who is really running this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121200002#H02600","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1544610600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

I accept that the Leader has been trying to facilitate that and I ask him to continue in his efforts, because Alzheimer's disease and dementia are hidden diseases that affect so many people in this country.  It is important that the HSE service plan recognises that and appoints sufficient advisers to our primary care centres to make sure families and patients access the services they need.<\/p><p>I have been looking back on the past year.  On many occasions we raised issues concerning the national broadcaster.  Concerns were raised initially about children's television, and how that was treated.  It was practically done away with.  Senator Norris led an all-party group addressing how RT&Eacute; has been dealing with this House and its coverage of it, which has been disappointing.  Very important points of legislation have been raised here and have not been covered.  I raised the selling off of land with the previous Minister.  It is very disappointing that no more than 10% of the RT&Eacute; site at Montrose, the bare minimum, was provided for social housing.  That has to be questioned.  The Minister said it was up to the board and washed his hands of it.<\/p><p>Licence fees are another issue.  While I have always been very negative about RT&Eacute;, its coverage, its responsibility as the national broadcaster and the subvention it receives as such, the non-collection of television licence fees has had a knock-on impact on independent producers of television programming.  We have seen a fall-off in investment of more than &euro;40 million since 2008.  Over recent weeks and months there have been several repeat programmes.  The independent producers produce an awful lot of content for RT&Eacute; and that has been slowly but surely reduced.  If we have a public service broadcaster, it has to get the investment needed to produce quality programmes.  It also has a responsibility to produce content, and reporting is a part of its public service.  Senator Leyden raised the issue of independent radio and television last week.<\/p><p>I want to bring the Leader back to one point.  Three or four weeks ago he said he would try to facilitate the Minister coming into the House to discuss the future of public service broadcasting.  With what we have seen about RT&Eacute; in the media over recent weeks, it is more important than ever that we have that conversation.  We must have a conversation on policy, on how RT&Eacute; treats its staff and on how it treats the public in its role as a public broadcaster.  We have to discuss other radio and television stations and how their public content is supported through the licence fee.  One issue that really needs to be addressed is the licence fee and the failure to collect it.  There is a working group in the Department which is about to make recommendations.  It would be timely if we had that discussion with the Minister in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121200002#H02700","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544610600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I want to raise the importance of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.

Of course the timing was a political statement.  The attackers could not get through to the European Parliament because there is very heavy security there, as there is at the Council of Europe.  I have been going to Strasbourg for ten years.<\/p><p>This brings home the dangers posed by terrorists.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should always be on alert for radicals, some of whom live in Ireland.  They can be as radical here as anywhere else.  A member of my family was caught up in the shooting last night.  Three people were killed and 13 injured.  My family member escaped but he was within feet of the shooting.  It brings home how close these issues are to everyone.  We should all feel very grateful that we have not been caught up in these situations.  It is almost Christmas, which is a Christian event.  It is a beautiful event in Strasbourg.  Three people died there and 13 were seriously injured.  To all their close friends and family members I offer our sympathies on this terrible tragedy before Christmas.  I hope that the terrorist, who is now on the run in France, is caught sooner than later because he will have a further shoot-out somewhere else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018121200002#J00600","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1544610600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I refer to what was called a dangerous precedent last night in which an amendment was not be allowed to be withdrawn.

However, it is an equally dangerous precedent to speak on an amendment for two hours and then withdraw it.  There has to be some reasonableness in how we approach our business.  I wish to say that in a calm way, because it was a little bit heated in here last night.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Humphreys on the licence fee.  I have often said that we need to overhaul radically how we collect the money.  The idea of a licence inspector going around checking if people have televisions in their homes to get the money out of them must be a thing of the past.  It must be radically reformed so that we charge at the source, through Internet providers or by some such method, so that this money can go to the Government.  All of those efforts and resources should not be expended in trying to collect moneys, something that could be done in a much more streamlined way.<\/p><p>I join Senator Leyden in his comments on the incident in Strasbourg.  I was lucky to spend some time on the Council of Europe and spent many a day in Strasbourg.  It is a beautiful city.  It is a joyous event and a very quiet, peaceful place.
