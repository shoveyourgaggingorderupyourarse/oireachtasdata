As somebody engaged in election observation, I can say this is an important element of the work that the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly does but, equally, we have a role through the EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR in terms of how we can enhance the electoral democratic process in many countries.  Election observation is a very important and critical part of that.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - I think it was in 2018 - did close the applications for election observation, but it is important that the range of observation positions is increased.  The petitioner in his reasons for his recommendations makes a good point that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated no recommendations have been made by D&oacute;chas or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is important to recognise that we do and can have a role to play as Members of the Oireachtas but also to assist in the enhancement of election observation.  The point that has been made by the petitioner around us lagging behind is an interesting one.  I am not sure that is actually the case, but he does provide us with a reference graph.  It is important that we have a discussion on the matter and that we do seek to bring about an increased number of election observation positions.

On what the petitioner is seeking in terms of the school curriculum at primary level and wanting to respond to the needs of children in society, from mental health issues to obesity, social media and so forth, I want to recognise what is already being done in schools.  I have attended meetings in the past couple of weeks with the HSE on the healthy eating programme.  I know from my own three children who are all in primary school that this programme which is in operation bans, certainly in the school that my children are in, snacks other than healthy eating snacks.  In terms of going from the academic, desk-based approach to the more outdoor-centred approach, and the response from the Department referencing Aistear, I want to recognise as well the work that Aistear is doing because I have seen its implementation and it is a very good programme.<\/p> <p>  The evolution of the curriculum over the last decade has been substantial and has been significant in terms of producing a broader and more holistic educational experience for children.  Certainly, I see that at first hand simply because I have three young children in primary school.  In respect of the broader debate on the curriculum, I welcome that this report will published this month, so I support Deputy Buckley in saying we should wait until we examine that further.  We have had the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in here before for extensive debate in respect of something similar in terms of the requirement and necessity for homework at primary school level; that was a hugely interesting debate about the rationale the Department set down for children having written studies after school and so forth.  There is a broader piece of work here, and I think we are right maybe to keep this open and have a further examination of it.  I want to acknowledge that a huge amount of work has been done on issues like obesity through the Department and the HSE on the healthy eating programme, the change from desktop to more outdoor through the work of the Aistear programme in which my own wife is involved.  Young teachers are hugely cognisant of the feelings and emotions and well-being of young children in schools, and it is only right and proper that that be acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019120400002#B00900","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Would any other members like to contribute?

As the committee will be aware, in 2019, as the Government advanced its original preparations for the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, supplementary funds were not available for new initiatives or programmes.  However, the Department has successfully secured funds to support its ongoing work in some key areas.  As a result, &euro;10 million has been agreed with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to boost investment across the transport, tourism and sport sectors.  The &euro;10 million is being allocated as current expenditure, primarily in the two programme areas of public transport and tourism.  The Estimates for 2019 already provide an overall current allocation to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of &euro;755 million.  This additional money will now bring the total allocation to &euro;765 million.  Our total allocation is used to provide vital tourism investment, as well as to support the ongoing delivery of the remit of the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly go through the areas receiving this additional money.  As part of the land transport programme, in the public transport area, &euro;617,000 has been allocated to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  This is to fund an estimate of &euro;308,000 in pensions non-pay which arose during the re-profiling of the pension estimate in 2018 from pay to non-pay.  Some &euro;309,000 is to assist in the purchase during 2019 of preliminary breath test devices used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to test drivers for alcohol consumption.  A sum of &euro;583,000 has been allocated to the NTA to purchase approximately 325,000 anonymous Leap cards to ensure that sufficient stocks are in place early next year.  A further &euro;1 million has been provided to the NTA, with &euro;100,000 being allocated for additional general administrative expenditure, &euro;450,000 for ICT infrastructure licensing and system updates, and &euro;450,000 for rental costs associated with additional accommodation.  Those costs are required to be paid in advance under the terms of the rental contracts.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the sports programme, some &euro;800,000 is being allocated to Sport Ireland for high performance sport.  This funding will be used to assist athletes&rsquo; preparations for major competitions, including the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo and key World and European Championship events.  In the tourism programme, &euro;1 million will be spent by F&aacute;ilte Ireland on domestic marketing, with a particular focus on the Border counties.  This marketing will include social media campaign engagement with Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland consumers, data analytics on Northern Ireland consumers, a domestic print campaign and a local expert programme supporting Border counties.  Some &euro;6 million will be spent by Tourism Ireland on a programme of reassurance concerning Ireland as a tourist destination, given the uncertainties raised by Brexit.  The new deadline for Brexit means that the UK can still leave with no-deal if the withdrawal agreement with the EU is not ratified by the British Parliament by 31 January 2020.  As a result, it is vital that my Department continues to take steps to provide as much certainty as possible in our tourist markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019120400002#B00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his address.
