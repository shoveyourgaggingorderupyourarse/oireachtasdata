Danone is the largest dairy group in the world, with more than 100,000 employees, 1,000 of whom are located in Ireland.  We have two large manufacturing plants in Ireland at which we produce infant formula.  Danone has a stated goal of \"One planet.  One health\", and it drives all of its employees towards that goal, which means decarbonising our plants.  We cannot do that without using biomethane and that is why I am here.  On behalf of RGFI, we thank the Chairman and the members for inviting us to address the committee.<\/p> <p>  RGFI is a not-for-profit forum representing those with an interest in an indigenous Irish biomethane industry, including farm organisations, community groups, Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, and end users for renewable gas.  We are asking the committee to consider renewable gas as part of the renewable energy mix.  RGFI fully supports the Government's long-term climate ambitions.  We believe that with smart, evidence-based policies, the transition can be positive for Ireland.  This requires significant private and public investment, however, and the deployment of appropriate new and innovative renewable technologies.<\/p> <p>  We acknowledge the commitment to reviewing the potential of anaerobic digestion to supply biomethane in the draft national climate action plan, NCAP.  We are concerned, however, at the figures used in the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, analysis in the plan.  We believe those figures are wrong and that is key to our presentation.  The MACC estimates biomethane at a cost of &euro;377 per tonne of CO2 abatement, whereas we estimate it, with proof, at some &euro;78 to &euro;150 per tonne of CO2 abatement and this is in line with other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  In October, RGFI submitted a business case for biomethane in Ireland to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  This KPMG report shows an overall positive 1.26 cost-benefit ratio through to 2050 for producing biomethane from agricultural organic matter.  Specifically, by replacing 12% of current natural gas consumption with biomethane, Ireland can save 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 per year, supporting our decarbonisation targets and creating more than 3,000 jobs for rural Ireland by 2030.<\/p><p>In the replacement of gas, biomethane is the lowest cost solution.  In order to realise this vision, we will need: Government policy and legislative support for biomethane, agricommunity-led anaerobic digester, AD, plants; a number of large food and commercial waste plants; and a capital investment of &euro;1.5 billion, supported by industry.  The proposed deployment and ramp up is in line with Northern Ireland, where 60 AD plants were built in the first five years of the industry being developed.<br\/><br\/>RGFI represents some of Ireland's largest energy users, including my company, Danone, Dairygold, Diageo, Pernod Rickard, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and Wyeth Nutritionals.  Biomethane is the only viable and available alternative solution for many of our businesses to decarbonise our processes without impacting on overall operations.  As users of natural gas, we can make an immediate switch to biomethane, which would deliver our environmental and climate benefit targets at lowest cost and with least disruption. <i><\/i>We are willing to play our part in this transition.  However, having the right policy conditions to support a scalable, renewable biomethane gas industry is essential if we are to remain competitive and in order to sustain economic growth.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has sufficient capacity to produce the required agricultural feedstocks without impacting on the livestock industry.  Scaleable AD will provide certainty of demand for many farmers, with capacity to produce more grass for both animal feed and the new AD market.  That will increase farm incomes significantly, bring about improvements in farm practices and further support the global reputation of Irish food exports.<br\/><br\/>As the Government finalises the national climate energy plan, we ask the committee to support a target of 12% for the replacement of current natural gas consumption with renewable biomethane; that biomethane would be included in the plan and in the Government's submission to the EU Commission, and funding support for the sector.  Failure to support an indigenous biomethane industry, at the appropriate scale, will lead to a missed opportunity for the decarbonisation of agriculture, as well as higher energy costs for industry, a weakening of national energy security, and reduced competitiveness for the processing and manufacturing sectors.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Dennehy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dennehy and call on Mr. Maguire to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We are grateful to the Chairman and members for affording us the privilege to present today.  For those who are not aware, the ISEA has been lobbying for support for solar energy since May 2013.  We are an all-island trade representative body with approximately 17 members in the solar space.  It has been a very exciting month.  We have seen a real sense of urgency that I have not seen in some time.  The publication of the climate action plan is to be very much welcomed.  The phasing out of peat stations is also to be welcomed.  The approval by the Government of the renewal energy support scheme, RESS, with a revised goal to deliver up to 70% renewables in our electricity mix by 2030 is really ambitious and extraordinarily challenging.  It will require a step change from both the public and private sectors in terms of how we approach renewables.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the quantum, we are proposing to deploy more than 12 GW of capacity between now and 2030.  The background is that we have only managed to deploy 3.8 GW in almost two decades, which indicates the extent of the challenge that we face in the renewables sector.  It is a matter of regret that we have not achieved our 2020 climate change targets.  That is very disappointing, particularly as the solar industry has had more than 0.5 GW of available fully-permitted projects ready to come online before 2020.  Moving forward, we have seen financing costs at a record low in terms of infrastructure, whether that is for wind, solar, biomass or others.  We are also seeing a massive cost reduction in those technologies, which are also historically low.  Despite our heretofore limited deployment of these technologies, our late mover advantage is that we have never been able to bring them online at a lower price than is the case today.<\/p> <p>  We have 1.3 GW of solar capacity fully permitted, with grid connections available, land and permits secured, with a further 1 GW due to receive offers for grid connection coming out of enduring connection policy, ECP-1.  The industry has been investing since 2016 to be ready for the RESS auctions.  While I very much welcome the Minister's announcement and the carving out of solar, it is only 10%, which represents a maximum of 300 MW in the first auction.  That is a little disappointing.  As an industry, we also welcome the community element.  It was originally proposed in the high-level design of RESS that community schemes would not come online until the second auction but the Department has stepped forward and brought that into the first auction.  We think that is a great thing to do, although it will be very challenging to get community schemes correct.  We have experience of that in other jurisdictions.  We also very much the proposal for a &euro;2 community contribution for every megawatt hour of generation.  In terms of community funding, we have seen challenges in other jurisdictions but there are now methodologies and technologies that can make this more efficient such as crowd-funding, where a &euro;10 investment has the same transaction cost as &euro;100,000.  The challenge is not slowing up the deployment of the renewables while the communities raise capital.  We ask the committee and the Government to consider whether the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or another organ of the State could perhaps provide bridging finance to allow community finance to come on board.<\/p> <p>  Switching back to solar, the KPMG report specifically shows that we are an industry which could quite easily deploy 4 GW by 2030.  We believe we can do a great deal more than that, and in the process create 7,300 jobs, and a significant value in terms of gross value added to the economy in tax take in the order of about &euro;3 billion in that timeframe between now and 2030.<\/p> <p>  Despite the positive news we have had in the past month, some serious barriers remain in the context of the deployment of renewables and solar in Ireland.  What we would like to see is more frequent auctions rather than four auctions between now and 2027.  As well as being more frequent the auctions should also dovetail with when the grid is available to take those assets online.  We would also like to see some consideration being given to reduce the cost and the time to connect and operate on the Irish grid system.  I very much welcome the moves that ESB Networks has taken in terms of engaging with industry to look at those costs but, frankly, this is something we have been talking about for four years.  We have the highest grid connection costs in Europe.  That means it is a higher levelised cost of energy, LCOE, because at the end of the day it is the consumer that pays.<\/p> <p>  We would also like to see legislative change to allow private wire in Ireland, whereby a generator can connect directly to the consumer.  This is quite a frustration for us coming from other jurisdictions in Europe where we are able to supply real power behind the meter and to have private wire across third party lands.<\/p> <p>  In the lead-up to the auctions, we would like to see a standardisation of rates and development contribution, which are leading to massive uncertainties in the auction process.  We need a standardised local authority rate and a standardised development contribution.  We would also like to see a fair price in terms of feed-in tariff for rooftop solar.  Under our obligations in the renewable energy directive, I believe we are obliged to provide a fair price for the wholesale price of power for any power that a consumer does not use themselves.  That is really important because it will change the behaviour of the public in terms of the way people consume and sell electricity themselves.  What may help to start the rooftop deployment of solar in Ireland is this feed-in tariff along with, potentially, a reduced VAT rate for renewable energy assets on houses such as, for example, solar photovoltaic, PV.<\/p><p> There also needs to be legislative changes to limit the qualification for planning appeals.  The wind industry has suffered greatly in the context of extended appeals and the solar industry is suffering also.  It is very easy to make an appeal in Ireland, which drags out the deployment of renewables by more than a year.  The climate action plan suggests that we need to deploy 8.5 GW of wind between now and 2030.  This will be extremely challenging.  It will never happen and we will have no chance of achieving it if we do not reform the process of planning appeals.  The UK, our nearest neighbour, effectively has a planning exemption in respect of solar for rooftops of up to 2 MW.  We ask for planning exemption for 0.5 MW.  This would remove the barrier for those who want to install solar on business premises.<\/p><p> We have come along way in the past few months, but we need to overcome some real hurdles.  It will require a co-ordinated effort from the public sector and the private sector.  The private sector has been waiting for some time.  We are ready.  We now ask that the organs of the State to step up also.  We are beginning to see that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present.  Addressing climate change is the challenge of our time.  It is an existential challenge that will determine our way of life, our well-being and the future of the habitat we enjoy today.  Those who follow will judge us on how we act upon this, and rightly so.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the transformational opportunity that offshore renewables, and particularly wind, present to us.  Ireland has a comparative advantage with some of the best wind regimes in the world.  With advances in technology in the past ten years, including floating offshore wind, Ireland is well placed for the production of renewable electricity at scale.<\/p> <p>  Our land to sea ratio is 10:1 so we have long been in marine renewable resources unlike some of our European partners who have no marine resources whatsoever.  The resource we have on our doorstep is inexhaustible.  The question is, how will we exploit this gift we have been endowed with.  The answer is that with vision and strategic intent Ireland can turn this comparative advantage into a competitive advantage and become a leader in addressing climate change.  Renewable technology advances have seen wind and solar generation becoming more competitive than nuclear and fossil fuel-based generation.<\/p> <p>  The new EU Commission has set an objective of Europe becoming the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050.  Much policy and support in that regard is expected in the proposed new green deal.  Electrification of heat and transport and the production of hydrogen and other gasses are set to see European demand for electricity production increase by more than double to 7,800 TWh by 2050.  Without fossil fuels, this would necessitate a massive ramping up of renewable generation and deployment.<\/p> <p>  Offshore wind is forecast to become the biggest source of generation in Europe by 2050, overtaking onshore wind and solar.  The reasoning behind the enhanced offshore wind drive includes higher wind speeds and load factors.  One can generate twice as much energy from a wind turbine in a marine environment than onshore.  There is community resistance to onshore, notwithstanding all of the efforts and endeavours that have been made for onshore wind.  Scale effects that can be achieved offshore is staggering.  There is also the possibility of deploying large offshore turbines leading directly to falling prices.<\/p> <p>  WindEurope undertook an indicative exercise, a report on which it published last week, that allocated the EU Commission&rsquo;s offshore target of 450 GW across those countries with offshore wind resources.  In this notional allocation, this country was given 22 GW with the following observations: Ireland needs to increase its leasing and consenting rate; it needs to work on its connectivity and supply chain; and it needs to start mobilising the technology by 2025.  It is useful to contextualise this 22 GW in two ways.  First, Ireland's current peak demand is 6 GW and the proposed Celtic interconnector is 0.7 GW.  When one considers the scale it is clear that this would entail exporting resources to continental Europe.  Second, the resource available within our waters can be measured in the thousands of gigawatts.  In other words, Ireland could aspire to do as much as it wishes in the future.  It is clear, however, that, notwithstanding its peripheral location, Ireland is, given its superior resources, viewed as a potential significant exporter of renewable wind energy.  I recommend WindEurope's Our Energy, Our Future report to members.  It makes for quite interesting reading.<\/p> <p>  Once one develops a material amount of energy in the European context, connectivity to European demand centres is required.  Irish consumers could not be expected to underwrite such an investment in generation and transmission.  Agreements with importer nations and entities would need to be struck.  Offshore wind is less variable than onshore but there are major benefits to not having too high a concentration of offshore wind in any single region, such as the North Sea, so that we may keep the lights on 24-7.  While Ireland could have the lowest cost of production, considerations around the cost of connecting and continuity of supply will inform the optimum spread of offshore wind around Europe.  The takeaway in this regard is that it is a European problem, not a national one, and we should think of it in that context.  A more integrated European regulatory approach than currently exists is required, as is a more interconnected pan-European grid.  We also need a master plan to try to get a good outcome for Europe, as a continent, by 2050.  Each country may make a case for how much it wishes to contribute in generation.  WindEurope&rsquo;s report states, \"Countries with offshore wind resources have a geographical responsibility to lead Europe in this ... enabling higher levels of offshore deployment\".<\/p> <p>  We are of the view that offshore wind will be called upon to increase its share of renewables in the future as other sectors struggle.  Many European countries are constrained due to designations, lack of marine resources and so on.  Ireland's 22 GW reflects an excess potential, but what is the right amount?  We could transmit as much as can to Europe.  Serving 5% of European energy demand by 2050 is not an unreasonable aspiration and would result in circa 70 GW of offshore wind.  This scale of development would result in new indigenous industries to diversify job creation and the tax base, especially in regional areas, and it would regenerate our coastal communities.  The scale of the development would also result in energy security with an avoided annual fuel bill of &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion and there would also be export revenue for the State's coffers.  Ireland would be offering leadership in responding to climate change.  Ireland would also exceed its targets and avoid penalties associated with not meeting those targets.<\/p> <p>  The exact quantum of 22 GW or 70 GW is less important than the concept and the vision of Ireland as a major exporter of renewables.  In this context, indigenous supply chain industries and jobs may be created in a way that they would not be created for a domestic play.  Beyond the vision, the next step is a roadmap to achieve and realise our potential.  Ireland needs to commit to the development of our renewable assets in the context of the long-term vision.  We need to give investors and developers a strong signal - as other countries have - that we are serious about developing our offshore resources.  In the past, Ireland has sparked industries that we had less right to develop than offshore wind.  By setting favourable terms and by supporting the inception of special development zones, such as the Shannon free zone and the International Financial Services Centre, Ireland has brought in foreign direct investment and supported local development.  We can do the same with offshore wind development.  The benefits of sharing the development of our offshore resource with those companies already involved in offshore generation in the North Sea are clear: more decarbonisation and more jobs in Ireland.  All we need to do is provide certainty to the market.  A special development zone is one option in this regard.  Supporting indigenous innovation in order to encourage the development of industries that are sustainable is vital.  We currently have a dormant offshore industry which sends its best people to work in the UK offshore wind industry.  This can be developed and grown to provide local jobs at a number of ports in Ireland, supporting not just the Irish development but also the European supply chain.<\/p> <p>  Follow through is necessary for the structures and frameworks in order to support a growing and developing industry.  A renewables centre of excellence should be set up with participation from industry and Government.  It is important that there is joint involvement.  It has worked very well in the UK.  Innovation support for new technologies &ndash; again with industry and Government participation - would also be required.<\/p><p>I would mention test and deployment centres, of which we have some, for offshore renewable energy technologies that deliver innovative projects, not only following technology but developing it.  It would be important for such a project to be pre-consented to the extent that it can be to accelerate that take-up of technology, to have a connection regime and to have a tariff regime for limited energy.<\/p><p> Furthermore, spatial planning for the optimal use of the marine environment is something to which we aspire.  I commend the Government on its efforts in that respect and it needs to be finished out by 2021.    It is important to have an engineering feasibility study for various levels of offshore renewable development.  I would point to a specifically dedicated zone-cluster for marine renewable technology to encourage companies to start up in Ireland.  Such an approach can give Ireland the chance to realise its potential, help Europe to become carbon neutral and Ireland to become a leader in addressing climate change.  <\/p><p> I thank the members for their time and if there are any questions my colleague, Mr. Robert O'Connor and I will be happy to endeavour to answer them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for that.

I will start with Deputy's question on carbon lock-in.  It is incredibly difficult to do deep decarbonisation.  Ireland is probably the leading country in decarbonising our electricity system as an island system.  It is very difficult to decarbonise.  Carbon lock-in will have to be actively tackled in our economy to try to escape from the clutches of carbon  That is an ongoing process that will continue through the coming decades.  We built our economy, in terms of our power, transport and agricultural systems, over 100 years based on carbon.  Therefore, it will be devilishly difficult to extract ourselves from carbon.<\/p> <p>  It is welcome we will have a new marine planning Bill.  It needed a push and it certainly got that.  I understand by 2021 we will have a marine spatial planning strategy.  It is important that system is streamlined so that people can develop projects in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible.  The marine spatial planning and development Bill is important and it should be expedited as a priority and continue to be a priority. <\/p> <p>  In terms of our ambitions for energy security and the use of offshore wind or other energies, what I have outlined is a European context.  It is not arguing that offshore wind should be counted towards X% of our energy security system.  There is no doubt it should be but what I am espousing is a vision and a view that we would say we have this incredible resource.  However, it will not get developed.  Nobody will ask us to develop it.  We need to be on the front foot and develop it ourselves.  The primary market for a scale of 20 GW or whatever is the European market and Ireland will be a secondary market.  By virtue of having all that energy on our doorstep, we will enhance our own security of supply.  We need a better network and better connectivity.  I applaud the Celtic interconnector and other forms of connectivity with Europe.  That is the way we will develop the future.  We will not do it as an island power system.  We will have to do it as part of an integrated pan-European system.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for his response.

It is quite similar.  One of the businesses in which I am involved, BNRG Renewables, has deployed many solar systems in the UK as have many members of our association.  We have been engaged with the planning authority for the development of a 10 MW site in eight weeks.  There is a statutory obligation on that planning authority to turn around the determination for that development in that time, or in 13 weeks if it is put to a vote in the local authority.  The appeals process is limited to a procedure.  One can only submit an appeal if there is a breach of procedure or if the procedure has not been followed.  That appeals window is open for six weeks and then it closes.  What I find very frustrating in Ireland is that it is very easy to take an appeal.  The appeals process must be robust but there is a great deal of uncertainty about planning.  We have been constructing solar systems globally in different jurisdictions for more than 12.5 years and Ireland is one of the most challenging development jurisdictions in which I have ever deployed this technology.  That is due to the uncertainty surrounding planning.  We do not have planning guidance on this but the planning system is robust enough to assess projects on their individual merits.  The challenge is the risk of the appeals process.  That needs to be reviewed with a view to reforming it.  Specifically, planning in respect of rooftop projects should also be considered.  Deploying solar systems on rooftops is exempt from the formal planning process in many European jurisdictions, whether it be a MW system on a factory of a solar system for a domestic home.  We have had discussions on this issue with An Taisce and other conservation bodies, including the National Trust in the UK which openly welcomes solar systems on listed buildings provided by such systems are installed sensibly.  Currently, that is a barrier to people putting solar systems on the roofs on their houses.  Those are the two areas that should be considered in planning law.<\/p> <p>  The third area that needs to be considered is the private wire issue, but that is probably a matter for the regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  As a generator, I cannot connect my generating asset to supply electrons to a factory located in a field away from my business but one can do that in many European jurisdictions.  I have to connect to the grid with all the costs that entails.  Addressing that issue would unlock great potential in terms of corporate power purchase agreements, PPAs, in Ireland.  Ultimately, as an industry, we are seeking best value for money for the consumer.  If renewals are oversubsidised in this country, they will just become unacceptable politically and they will not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I advise Deputy Chambers that we are seven minutes into his timeslot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#F00900","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>When Mr. Maguire concludes his response, I will pass over to Senator Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#F01000","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#F01100","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>My final point is that solar representing 10% of the auction-based scheme is quite disappointing.

Rooftop solar will create the \"energy citizen\" and democratise our energy sector.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at lifting the planning restrictions.  My association met the Minister with responsibility for planning during the summer and outlined our position.  The official line was that wind energy guidelines would dominate the thinking in the Department.  The Minister made an announcement at the start of the week and we expect, perhaps this side of Christmas, that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will make an announcement and take on board the different considerations we have.  The planning system is fairly robust but we want a policy in place that is transparent and operative for consumers who want to enter into the space.  It should also serve a responsible trade association that wants to ensure the highest standards in industry.<\/p> <p>  KPMG produced an independent report a number of years ago titled, A Brighter Future: Solar PV in Ireland.  It considered all the scenarios for deploying solar power in Ireland and predicted we could create 7,300 jobs by deploying approximately 3 GW of solar power in the system.  As the chairman has said, there is approximately 1.7 GW ready to go and we are awaiting the announcement from the Minister flagged on Monday.  There is a solar pot but 10% of availability in the first auction, which we expect to run in June next year, is under-ambitious.  We will intensively try to persuade the Minister of the merits of increasing that allowance.  There are more than sufficient skilled personnel there.  As a country we regrouped after the recession in the 1980s and the most recent recession to upskill and learn new trades and qualifications.

The association has asked for a 2 MW exemption.  The principle is important in the sense that the planning permission is a necessary part of a robust planning system.  The ask from the industry in terms of a request to increase the exemption to 2 MW is reasonable.  The exemption was brought in at a time when we were dealing with solar thermal, which is a much heavier panel.  We met the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, during the summer.  The focus of the Department at that time was on the wind energy guidelines, in respect of which the Minister made an announcement at the beginning of this week.  The Department has since committed to examining the proposed ISEA planning permission and we expect some movement on that this side of Christmas.<\/p> <p>  The point in terms of rooftop space is important.  We can lead the way in Ireland in terms of decarbonisation.  The State can do that by way of the Department of Education and Skills in terms of school rooftops and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in terms of the roof space on farms.  The blockage to this is the lack of an export tariff.  Nobody is going to introduce a system if what is unused must go back into it.  There is a particular issue around ESB Networks and the export tariff.  This industry deals with a number of organs of the State, including the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the CRU, ESB Networks, EirGrid and 31 local authorities, which is quite difficult at a bureaucratic level.  For most other industries there is probably only a regulator and one point of contact.  This area is populated by many organs of State, all of which are important and necessary.

McCarthy that in my reading of it the best scientific advice runs counter to everything they have said today.  I refer them to the three reports published recently for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, on the bioenergy supply curve for Ireland for 2015 to 2030 published in 2016; the costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane in Ireland published in 2017; and the sustainability criteria options and impacts of Irish bioenergy resources published this year.  The best independent scientific advice makes it clear that the costs of using agricultural feedstock is, at best, marginal.  Perhaps we should look at and refer to the German example.  Germany has been way ahead of us on this with massive investment.  It has stopped that process.  Due to the environmental problems associated with growing maize for biomethane instead of for feedstock Germany stopped doing it.  I believe the same thing would happen here.  The reports also state that if we are going to use the gas, it only makes economic sense to do so if it is used on the farm on site rather than in industrial food production facilities.  That is when it starts to make economic sense.<\/p> <p>  The reports also state that if we are going to do it then grass silage amounts should be no more than approximately 20% or 25%.  Waste materials are what works.  If we used a higher proportion than 20% to 25% of grass silage there would be net negative climate emissions because we would be engaged in a gas production system.

We have destroyed our land with this industrial farming system and we do not need to make the process worse.<\/p> <p>  The reports also state that slurry is not available.  They completely differ from what the witnesses have just said.  The Northern Ireland route is the subject of utter scandal and corruption with regard to the renewable heat incentive scheme.  Anaerobic digesters are similar to the renewable heat incentive scheme in the way it has led to a massive increase in industrial agricultural production systems where animals are kept indoors and there is a huge expansion in slurry with huge consequences and environmental consequences.  If we want to go down that route for Irish agriculture we might just about have enough slurry but that is not the way we want to go.  We want to keep our animals out.<\/p> <p>  We do not want to go to intensive industrial agriculture.  We want to be origin brand green and not have an industrial agriculture model.  To do all of this to create an artificial baby milk powder that we ship halfway around the world to replace breastmilk, which is the more natural healthy and genuinely low-carbon and sustainable product, just leads to the entire system from tail to end probably being one of the least sustainable things we do.  We need to be honest and clear with Irish farmers and not send them down the garden path towards a system that will be pulled back because it is not sustainable.

We have a huge comparative cost advantage in offshore wind and we should be thinking ambitiously.  It is part of a European project.  I was just looking through the European report that Mr. Fitzgerald referred to.  Ireland is looking at 22 GW and we have 425,000 km&sup2; of probably the windiest sea area in the world and Poland, with only 30,000 km&sup2; in the relatively becalmed Baltic generates 28 GW, which is 6 GW more than us.  This leads me to think we are not being ambitious enough with 22 GW.  I note the European report divides it between 6 GW in the Irish Sea and 16 GW in the west and with regard to cost very much focuses on the north west rather than the south west, which surprised me.  Perhaps the north west is windier and that is why it is a lower cost.  Let us assume we follow the report's advice and put 20 GW in the north west.  Does Mr. Fitzgerald believe shipping it to the rest of Europe will involve the onshore Irish transmission system?  Are we best landing it ashore in Ireland and using existing and new interconnectors to transfer it?  Has Mr. Fitzgerald thought yet about how that 20 GW of power would be shipped?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#L01100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The 22 GW was an exercise carried out by WindEurope.

The questions are how much we want to do, how we would do it at scale on the west coast and what methods we would use.  We have a transmission system built for 4.5 million people.  It is probably creaking at the seams with the amount of land-based renewables we are trying to put onto it.

I will begin by discussing the renewable gas forum.  I wish to make the general point that when we declared a climate emergency we also declared a biodiversity emergency and there is an intersection around our climate and ecological targets.  I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Ryan given that Ireland sponsored the report to the UN on land use, the issue of the transfer of land, for example, to grow fuels versus other things.  Ideally, we must consider biofuels as a by-product of ethical farming practices and that is where we want to move to, and remember that Ireland has a lot of waste products and high levels of food waste. <\/p> <p>  I will focus on ammonia pollution.  Ireland was found to be in breach of ammonia emission levels in 2016 and 2017, and there are forecasts that we are in danger of continuing to breach the level.  In Ireland, the Nitrates Action Plan has been hugely criticised by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, plus Ireland's rivers have breached the acceptable levels of ammonia and we know that we are in breach.  The witnesses will have heard of some of the other concerns about the North but one of the concerns about the North concerns ammonia as well.  The witnesses have talked about the model moving on, moving towards Red II, and considering artificial fertilisers.  What is happening, what should happen and what can happen in terms of the ammonia levels?  What I say relates to the planning issue, which we have also heard about, in terms of locations.

If I miss one, please let me know.<\/p> <p>  An important aspect, in terms of addressing a number of those issues, is that we need to ensure that biomethane is supported in the National Energy and Climate Plan, NECP, that will go to Brussels in December of this year. <\/p> <p>  Specifically on ammonia, ammonia is released when raw slurry is spread.  Ammonia is, typically as we experience it, gaseous.  Significantly, with anaerobic digestion technology and the process of having this on-farm, the process converts the ammonia to ammonium.  The process crystalises it and transforms it into molecules so it comes out in the digestate, which is biofertiliser.  That capturing prevents ammonia from being emitted into the atmosphere and one converts it, as part of the biofertiliser, through application to pasture land.  In line with the Red II, those opportunities are clearly outlined, which is where we see significant opportunities and benefits around environmental and biodiversity issues.  It assists certainly with the displacement of artificial fertilisers which, fundamentally, in their manufacture use a lot of fossil fuels.  We could build an indigenous biofertiliser industry.  We know what the ingredients are and we are dealing with the ammonia issue.  One would apply to land a more homogenous material that is absorbed by the soil and readily taken up by plants thus displacing artificial fertiliser and dealing with the ammonia issue.  Also, one avoids the run-off generated by raw slurry spreading and artificial fertiliser thus improving water quality.  We are working with many local authorities and local community groups such as LEADER groups in Ballyhoura, Kilkenny and other regional jurisdictions to solve the problems and improve water quality, air quality and biodiversity.  There are fundamental environmental and ecology reasons to support this.<\/p> <p>  On specific networks, as mentioned earlier we do not need a dedicated network because we already have gas networks.  The biomethane reaches and meets the same technical standards as natural gas so we do not need any specific dedicated networks.  We are working with some regions where they are considering developing local networks such as Sligo; localised use is fundamental to our strategic approach that anaerobic digesters are located close to networks, or have access to networks, where one has end-use.  In cases where there are gas users who are off-grid, we can certainly consider solving that by way of a virtual pipeline.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#M01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P.J.

First, we have set out some fundamentals for the industry to give confidence to producers and end consumers of renewable gas.  Approximately three years ago, we set out a European call on the design process for the green gas certification scheme, which involves a guarantee of origin.  This is not available in the North.  The sustainability of the production of biomethane has not been monitored in the North.  The producers and the members of the farming community need to have certainty that there are clear guidelines.  The certification scheme, which is designed around the RED II, is the first of its kind in Europe.  We have gone for best practice.  After we went to tender on foot of a European call, the contract was awarded to Dena and DBFZ, which are experts in this area of sustainability.  They advise the European Commission.  They are co-authors of some advisory and policy documents at European level.<\/p> <p>  From an Irish perspective, we have referred to best practices, best competencies and best expertise.  Despite what we might think, we do not have that expertise in Ireland.  We need to draw on the resources, expertise and competencies at European level.  That is the only way we can get confidence.  We are interested in building a robust and sustainable industry.  All sectors can embrace the benefits and opportunities here.  I refer specifically to the need to know what we are doing, and to know it is based on the best available technologies.  We need to draw on the expertise of other member states across Europe, such as France, which have set out some key strategic enablers.  Fundamentally, the establishment of a national co-ordination body is being promoted by the RGFI at present.  This was highlighted in a recent KPMG report.  We are engaging with Teagasc in a collaborative and consultative manner to look at assisting in the development of expertise and competencies.  We are setting up the Teagasc range as a centre of excellence for the development of the best technology and the best advice.  We are looking at facilitating that through the planning process.  We are looking at the best routes for developing biomethane.  The best pathway for those who are interested in developing the industry involves looking at the national strategic advisory body.

Everybody in the renewable energy sector will agree the feed stock is free.  Once one is up and running, that cost will decrease.  For solar energy, it could be anything on the range from 6 cents to 9 cents for a kW hour.

This is not about Ireland and if it was, we would be out of business because we started developing here at the start of 2016 at the same time we entered the US market.  We have since got about 130 MW of projects under construction in the US with lots more to come.  Those skill sets go overseas all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019120400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Maguire"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Senator asked about cost.  We have a comparative advantage with wind so we can make it.  It has been made in the UK and France for a wholesale price of 4p per kW hour.  That is really competitive.  It does not need a subsidy and we are not asking for one.  We are asking for a framework to work out how much we want to do and to set out a road map to have as much offshore wind energy as possible because as was said, our resource is huge.  The question is how much we want to contribute to decarbonising Europe through our offshore wind resource because that is our strength.  Offshore wind energy and wind energy are what we have.  We are at 55&deg; degrees latitude in the north west.  If we want to do other things we can do them as well but wind is what we have a comparative advantage with.

As somebody engaged in election observation, I can say this is an important element of the work that the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly does but, equally, we have a role through the EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR in terms of how we can enhance the electoral democratic process in many countries.  Election observation is a very important and critical part of that.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - I think it was in 2018 - did close the applications for election observation, but it is important that the range of observation positions is increased.  The petitioner in his reasons for his recommendations makes a good point that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated no recommendations have been made by D&oacute;chas or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is important to recognise that we do and can have a role to play as Members of the Oireachtas but also to assist in the enhancement of election observation.  The point that has been made by the petitioner around us lagging behind is an interesting one.  I am not sure that is actually the case, but he does provide us with a reference graph.

On what the petitioner is seeking in terms of the school curriculum at primary level and wanting to respond to the needs of children in society, from mental health issues to obesity, social media and so forth, I want to recognise what is already being done in schools.  I have attended meetings in the past couple of weeks with the HSE on the healthy eating programme.  I know from my own three children who are all in primary school that this programme which is in operation bans, certainly in the school that my children are in, snacks other than healthy eating snacks.  In terms of going from the academic, desk-based approach to the more outdoor-centred approach, and the response from the Department referencing Aistear, I want to recognise as well the work that Aistear is doing because I have seen its implementation and it is a very good programme.<\/p> <p>  The evolution of the curriculum over the last decade has been substantial and has been significant in terms of producing a broader and more holistic educational experience for children.  Certainly, I see that at first hand simply because I have three young children in primary school.  In respect of the broader debate on the curriculum, I welcome that this report will published this month, so I support Deputy Buckley in saying we should wait until we examine that further.  We have had the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in here before for extensive debate in respect of something similar in terms of the requirement and necessity for homework at primary school level; that was a hugely interesting debate about the rationale the Department set down for children having written studies after school and so forth.  There is a broader piece of work here, and I think we are right maybe to keep this open and have a further examination of it.  I want to acknowledge that a huge amount of work has been done on issues like obesity through the Department and the HSE on the healthy eating programme, the change from desktop to more outdoor through the work of the Aistear programme in which my own wife is involved.  Young teachers are hugely cognisant of the feelings and emotions and well-being of young children in schools, and it is only right and proper that that be acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2019120400002#B00900","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Would any other members like to contribute?

I am the chairperson of the board of directors of Scouting Ireland.  With me today are Dr. John Lawlor and Mr Gear&oacute;id Begley. <br\/><br\/>I reaffirm that Scouting Ireland is as safe an organisation as it can be.  Even in the period since our last meeting, improvements have been made to our already good safeguarding procedures and practices, not least of which was the recruitment of a professional safeguarding manager last April and an expansion in the professional safeguarding team.  Safeguarding our young people and adult volunteers is not a static environment, however.  Scouting Ireland has not rested on its laurels in that regard but instead is continuously reviewing practices and systems to ensure we remain best in class<b><\/b>at all times, as all youth organisations should.  Scouting Ireland has gone through a major governance transformation since our previous meeting.  The board of Scouting Ireland is now fully a board of oversight.  We will move to full compliance with the community and voluntary governance code by the end of January 2020, with full compliance with the charities regulatory code by year end in time for the mandatory application of the code.<br\/><br\/>The committee will be aware that we have recruited a new CEO to take office in the new year.  We have also just completed an exercise to co-opt outside directors to the board, enhancing our skill set.  Two new directors have been co-opted to the board, namely, Mr. Donal Lawlor, a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland and former managing director of a multinational company in Ireland, and Ms Lorraine Lally, a barrister and qualified mediator.  We have a positive working relationship with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and her Department for their ongoing support and guidance over the past year.  Similarly, our working relationship with all of the State agencies continues to be positive, including the relationships with Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and the gateway teams in Northern Ireland, the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland, CCNI, and the Charities Regulator in the Republic.<br\/><br\/>The board of Scouting Ireland has entered into an independently managed evaluation process to ensure proper performance management of the board as a team.  Directors and trustees have completed training to support them in their roles and we are due our first election cycle at our April annual general meeting.<\/p><p>A full review of all risk in Scouting Ireland has been completed and a workforce plan has been delivered with required resources identified.  New departmental core teams and department managers have been appointed and are operating.  All new positions are implemented via open and rigorous recruitment processes, whether that is at board, sub-committee, core team or CEO level.  We are currently formulating our new strategic plan which will be completed by the end of January 2020.<\/p><p> A phenomenon which has emerged is the influx of external individuals with no previous connection to Scouting Ireland with the skills and experience to fill competency gaps across our organisation.  We have defined new organisational structures with clear lines of accountability and reporting.  All of this has been facilitated by a dedicated transition sub-committee, along with the assistance and expertise of an external governance expert.  This is a period of significant change for our membership and we recognise the fast pace of the changes.  However, the majority of our membership see the need for such governance changes and have supported the board in its important work in this regard.<\/p><p> Moving to historical matters, the recent &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme again shone a searing light on the hurt done to young people in the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, CBSI, and the Scout Association of Ireland, SAI.  We recognise the courage and bravery of all survivors who have told their stories directly to us and who featured on the programme.  It is an example of leadership to all and it is humbling.  We again apologise unreservedly to those who were hurt by the actions of adult volunteers in these legacy organisations.<\/p><p> The picture which emerged of these organisations over the past 18 months is grim and shocking.  Although Scouting Ireland inherited this situation from the CBSI and the SAI, we have not shirked our responsibilities in looking after our survivors, inviting them to contact us directly, which the majority did, and offering support where we can.  We are continuing to deal with the consequences of the betrayal that some adults in the past visited upon our most vulnerable members.  It should be recognised that once Scouting Ireland understood the extent of the problem in the legacy organisations following Mr. Ian Elliott&rsquo;s work, not only did we acknowledge it but it was we who brought it into the public domain.  We have apologised to all individuals who contacted us.  We also maintained the helpline to allow more survivors to share their stories.  Our focus has been to support people coming forward to us with allegations of sexual abuse, as well as to report any reportable offences brought to the attention of our safeguarding team to the statutory authorities, namely, Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Republic of Ireland, and the PSNI and Gateway in Northern Ireland.  Our helpline, 1-800-221199, remains open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for those wishing to report new information to the safeguarding team.  We want to assure survivors that they will be listened to, they will be treated compassionately and every new piece of information provided to us will be followed up.<\/p><p> The RT&Eacute; programme made several allegations relating to individuals in senior positions in these organisations and their failure to act on information relating to sexual abuse in scout groups across Ireland.  Whereas we cannot comment on individual cases, we can assure the committee, parents, guardians, and our volunteers and staff that Scouting Ireland is a very different organisation from these legacy organisations in which so many were let down and badly treated.  Scouting Ireland has always reported any reportable offences brought to the attention of our safeguarding team to the appropriate authorities.  We adopted mandatory reporting in 2003, 12 years before Children First legislation was enacted in 2015 and 14 years before it became law in 2017.  Our adult volunteers must be Garda vetted and undertake mandatory safeguarding training every three years.  The continual improvement of safeguarding in Scouting Ireland is a priority for the board and the executive.  We have put in place strong governance and safeguarding measures within our organisation to help ensure scouting is a safe place for our members, volunteers and employees.<\/p><p> In the past 18 months, we have introduced new governance structures within Scouting Ireland that provide greater accountability, transparency and openness in our organisation, implemented the agreed Scouting Ireland-Tusla action plan and fully completed the findings of the Jillian van Turnhout governance review.  As previously stated, we appointed a full-time safeguarding manager and expanded the professional safeguarding team.  Child safeguarding policies and procedures have been independently reviewed by Mr. Ian Elliott and further developed by our safeguarding manager and team.  We developed new procedures for the assessment and handling of child protection disclosures.  We introduced a new disciplinary code and appointed a disciplinary panel of three members, one of whom is external to Scouting Ireland.  We continue to liaise with all relevant authorities, including Tusla, Gateway, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Charities Regulator and the Charities Commission of Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> This is not to say that we are standing still.  As already stated, we continue to make improvements to our safeguarding structures and look to implement best practices.  Mr. Ian Elliott is conducting a learning review which will appraise the history of abuse in the CBSI and the SAI, how allegations were handled by these organisations and the learnings for Scouting Ireland for the future.  Mr. Elliott's work has been a driver for substantial change in Scouting Ireland to date.  It goes without saying that he is absolutely independent in his recommendations to us and in his judgment concerning safeguarding matters.  Regrettably, for personal reasons, he cannot be here today.<\/p><p> We strongly assure the committee, our members and employees, parents and the general public that we are acting with urgency and will act immediately when a safeguarding issue is brought to our attention.  We cannot allow the past to define our present or future.  The key credential we present for that different future is the manner in which we are facing up to that past, in those historical scouting organisations.  Scouting Ireland is different.

Scouting Ireland cannot discuss individual cases.  It is not appropriate to do so.  We are extremely conscious of the confidentiality of those involved.  Where disclosure has been made to Scouting Ireland, the individual making such a disclosure has done so on the understanding that the information they provided will be treated confidentially.  It is essential that that trust is not breached.  Additionally, the discussion of an individual case in a public forum has the potential unintentionally to identify an individual who has made a disclosure that could result in further trauma for the person.  Scouting Ireland is also conscious that to discuss individual cases in a public forum has the potential to jeopardise inquiries being made by State agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.<\/p> <p>  Scouting Ireland is aware that individuals have been named in the media.  What can be said in respect of that is that all disclosures made to the child protection and safeguarding personnel in Scouting Ireland have been, and were, reported to State agencies.  In all cases where it was appropriate or recommended that a person would be removed, that was actioned.  I hope that answers Deputy Rabbitte's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019120400002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Lawlor.

There is the present day and how Scouting Ireland will give people confidence going forward.  As a parent of two, I recently decided not to allow my child to join the scouts.  Some might say that is due to total paranoia on my part, but I honestly did not feel in any way confident in the organisation after everything that came out.  I am generally a fairly reasonable and open-minded person but I still do not feel confidence in the organisation.  One way Scouting Ireland could restore confidence is by dealing adequately with the historic cases and by being open to a genuine, independent public inquiry.  That will not take away anything that happened to those people at all, which was horrific, and here we are again talking about horrific cases, but it would give people confidence and it would also give people the justice they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019120400002#E05000","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>A number of issues arise and, with your permission, Chairman, we will deal with them separately.

That is quite correct and we have owned that since we became aware of it last year.  We broke that story ourselves.  It was horrific and depraved.  While we have inherited strong traditions and other good things from our former organisations, equally we must also own this.  We take the good with the bad.  It is absolutely horrific.  We were as upset as anybody else when watching those television programmes.  I again acknowledge the bravery of those who spoke out and those who have come forward and spoke to us and to other statutory agencies.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about current confidence in the organisation.  As I said in my opening statement, we are in the middle of developing a new strategic plan for Scouting Ireland.  As part of this, we carried out a survey of people involved with Scouting Ireland, including youth members, adult members, parents and some outside stakeholders.  We expected 300 to 400 responses, which would give us a good data set on which to formulate our new strategic plan.  We actually got 1,306 responses.  To help in answering Deputy Funchion's question, 695 of those responses came from parents.  We asked specific questions of those who identified themselves as parents.  We asked them how strongly they agreed with certain statements on a scale of one to ten.  These statements included \"My child is safe when attending Scouts\", \"I am aware of Scouting Ireland's Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy\" and \"I feel there is good supervision for children at Scouts\".  This is very recent information so I am quite happy to share it today.  The average score for each of these statements was 9.1, 9.4 and 9.1 respectively.  The parents who are with us at the moment and to whom we owe a great deal for retaining that trust and faith in us continue to have great confidence in Scouting Ireland because they know the changes we have made in respect of safeguarding over recent years.  It is our job, as the board of directors, to protect that trust and to continue implementing best practice in this area.  On the issue of best practice, I will pass over to Mr. Begley who will speak about what happens now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019120400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>The task before me since I took up this post is to ensure that processes are in place which give confidence to parents and to ensure that, where issues are raised, they are properly addressed.  That is the challenge for the organisation.  We recognise that.  Public confidence and parents' confidence and trust in Scouting Ireland is very important.  The task facing Scouting Ireland, which my team and I have undertaken, is to put processes in place to make sure that, where a disclosure is made, it is properly recorded, that the decision-making process in respect of the disclosure is also recorded, and that if the disclosure meets the threshold of harm set out by Tusla, a report is made as mandated and all information is provided to the statutory agency.<\/p> <p>  If the disclosure does not meet the threshold of harm for a mandated report, we ask whether it is still a cause for concern.  Consideration is given to making a report on that basis.  If a disclosure does not meet either standard, we ask whether action needs to be taken.  We then go back to the person who made the disclosure and tell him or her that, after consideration, we have decided that it either came under one of those two categories or that we do not believe it meets the thresholds.  We may have a suggestion as to what action should be taken within the organisation but we tell the person who made the disclosure that, if he or she is not happy with our suggestion, he or she is at liberty to make a report to the relevant State agency, which may be An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla, the PSNI, or Gateway.  If we do make a report, we liaise with the State agency involved.  If it needs any information from our records, we make it available.  On occasion a member of Scouting Ireland may have to make a witness statement that could become part of a criminal prosecution.  That is part of the process.<\/p> <p>  I could talk about it at more length but it is part of ensuring that systems are in place to record disclosures, the decisions made on such disclosures, the feedback given to those who make disclosures, and the information provided to State agencies in that regard.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  We built on what Mr. Ian Elliott had done.  We are developing it further.  We are always conscious that this is a movable feast.

However, Mr. Tennant is here as head of Scouting Ireland.  I argue that he must also answer for what happened in the CBSI and the SAI.  Our job here is to interrogate the dynamic that led to allegations against persons not being dealt with by the organisation.  I am still unclear in my mind as to why, if the Children First guidelines were adopted in 2012, it took a full five years before Scouting Ireland brought in Ian Elliott.  During that time, and arguably now, there were persons in the organisation, and I do not know if they are still in the organisation, who took receipt of information from people who were traumatised and those case files were put into a filing cabinet.  A review was to have taken place in 2012 but we remain blind about where that review went, how those cases were managed and whether there are people who are part of the 2017 to 2019 review who are taking receipt of the information who are still part of the staff.  We want to understand the culture that existed within the organisation.  If, as Mr. Tennant suggests, the new broom is sweeping clean, are there people who were in receipt of information in 1987 and 1996, the years which were subject of the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme, who are still on the staff and are part of the old culture who continue to be employed?  That is the kernel of the matter.  Mr. Tennant speaks of Scouting Ireland opening up its processes and creating helplines, but I find it hard to understand how anybody who was dealt with by personnel in 1987 or 1996 might find themselves being dealt with by the same personnel in 2017, 2018 or 2019.  Does Mr. Tennant understand how that might look extremely bad for an organisation such as Scouting Ireland?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tennant is putting a lot of store in the Ian Elliott process.  Everyone here accepts Ian Elliott's bona fides, but what they do not buy is that regardless of whether he is a consultant, he is paid by Scouting Ireland to conduct a review and therefore he is an employee of Scouting Ireland.  We are questioning the independence of the process.  What we are trying to get at is what will arise from the Elliott process when he reports.  Regardless of whether he likes it, Mr. Tennant has an idea of how this will play out because he strikes me as someone who has gamed this, which I do not mean in a pejorative sense.  He knows how the process is going; we do not.  I do not know the contents of Ian Elliott's report.  I am very concerned that it will go into the public domain and the people who made complaints in 1987 and 1996 and the people who were the subject of the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme will have no justice, recourse or right of reply.

It is not the case that disclosures were taken and placed in a filing cabinet and that nothing was done.  That is simply not the truth.  The truth is that when a disclosure was made it was reported to statutory agencies.  The record is clear and consistent through the whole history of Scouting Ireland.  Children First was mentioned and 14 years before mandatory reporting was introduced in 2017, Scouting Ireland was reporting to statutory agencies on a regular basis.  Those files from 2003 and from before the review the Deputy referenced in 2012 were made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and were utilised by it in the context of its investigations of criminal cases.  These are the facts.  It is important to note that before the late 1990s, these matters were strictly handled by volunteers in the legacy organisations.  That is what happened and that is the truth.  That was not a satisfactory situation but I should leave it to the work of Mr. Elliott to help us understand that.  He is open to bringing those matters to this committee when he concludes his work.<\/p> <p>  On the staff, it is important to say they have behaved in an exemplary fashion.  I will ask Mr. Begley to comment on this but they behaved heroically last year in their work on the helpline in how they empathetically dealt with victims who came on board.  The numbers say so and the data say so.  As I said here in March, the truth was evidenced by that work.  It was an uncomfortable truth for Scouting Ireland.  For those of us who love Scouting Ireland and have loved Scouting Ireland since the time we were children, we have to live with that truth but it is correct we brought that to the fore.

Correct me if I am wrong but my interpretation of that was Scouting Ireland failed to carry out a scoping exercise to see if further work was required on the files of complaint.  My understanding is that was never done, that an undertaking was given to carry out such work and that there are minutes to that effect.  What was pertinent there was that Scouting Ireland would carry out the scoping exercise, it would have a statistical analysis for all child protection cases, especially for the files in Mount Melleray.

On the 2012 review, there were two key points of focus.  First, due to an incident that happened a year before it was identified that somebody who had been removed from one of the legacy organisations who had been mentioned in one of the files had found their way back into the organisation and that was dealt with straight away.  Second, a review was carried out on 332 files, none of which was in Mount Melleray.  I do not know where the reference to Mount Melleray comes from but none of these files was ever there, they were always in Larch Hill.  Those files were examined to see if anybody else was a member of the organisation that was named in those files and to see that if there had been a reportable offence, that it had been reported to the statutory authorities.  That review mentioned the traffic light system.  The majority of the files were deemed to be green and so they were fine.  They were up-to-date, reporting had been done and the people concerned were not involved in Scouting Ireland.  There were five files where it could not be determined whether people had been reported by that date to the statutory authorities.  Those cases were reported immediately.  That was the purpose of the review.  From that date in 2012, all the files that were there at that point in time had been cleared to ensure that none of those people was a member of Scouting Ireland and that all those cases had been reported to statutory agencies.  That was a watershed moment in 2012.  I will pass the second part of the question onto the CEO, Dr. Lawlor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019120400002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I took office in March 2012 and I actioned the 2012 review in July 2012.  I did so because I was deeply concerned at the emergence of a situation where somebody who had been removed from a legacy organisation in 1972 had gained access to Scouting Ireland.  That happened as a result of the change from a paper-based system to databases.  Once we had that information the person was immediately removed but I had a concern there may be other such situations.  It was prudent and correct to investigate that and so it was not just a scoping exercise.  As Mr. Tennant said, the primary consideration was to find out if we had anybody in this organisation who should not have been there.  Deputy Funchion rightly pointed to that concern.  We had to convince ourselves there was nobody in the organisation who should not have been there.  We also wanted to make sure we were up to date with reporting on these issues.  I know Deputy Sherlock has referenced minutes and I do not know what fragment of correspondence he has but there is extensive correspondence between the safeguarding team of the time and the statutory agencies about the work that was done and about what needed to be done.  The follow-on work was done, the reporting was done and subsequent to 2012, the files were made available to and accessed again by both agencies, particularly An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in relation to criminal prosecutions.  The cataloguing that was done was important because it made it easier for those agencies to access the information.  What might have caused the confusion with the reference to Mount Melleray is that the only files we had there were census records so where we had a question on whether an individual was in the scouts in 1972, for example, we would have to go and check the old census records.  However, as Mr. Tennant said, the safeguarding files were always maintained in Larch Hill and from the inception of Scouting Ireland they were always made available to the statutory agencies for their investigations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019120400002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I have a question about the traffic light system.

There is a facility whereby if somebody calls outside office hours he or she can leave a voicemail with contact details to request that we make contact.  There are calls where a person discloses information, seeks advice or asks what happens if he or she makes a disclosure, and the process is explained.  That is not recorded electronically.  A written contemporaneous note is made by the person receiving the call.  The caller is thanked for making the call and it is acknowledged that making such a call can be a very difficult thing to do.<\/p> <p>  On some occasions we get calls which are silent because the person does not feel able to speak.  We have had people call two or three times.  They may not have spoken on the first occasion, but will speak on the second occasion without giving details and we would encourage them to return by saying if they call again they can give us any name so we know they have called before.  When we get to a point where people are happy to discuss or disclose some information we will take a written note of that and give a heartfelt apology on behalf of the organisation because people who were abused in scouting when they were children were the victims of a major betrayal of trust.  We offer them the choice to avail of a free and confidential counselling service if they wish.  Some people want to take the information or say they are already in counselling and others say they do not want the information and it is not for them.  It is their choice.  They give us as much information as they want to give us.  <\/p> <p>  Some people have come to terms with what has happened to them and are quite comfortable discussing what can be quite graphic details.  They are not easy calls to take and are as emotionally draining for the person taking them as for the person making them.  We would record whatever information people give us.  Sometimes it can be quite a lot of information, on other occasions it can be a person simply saying, \"I was abused\".  The only clarification we try to get from people is whether they were sexually abused because then it  immediately reaches a threshold of harm in terms of reporting to Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p> <p>  We listen more than we ask questions.  The person on the line may or may not wish to give contact details.  If we are to provide people with details about counselling, we need some sort of contact information.  The committee has to appreciate that sometimes the people calling us do not want to give their home addresses, their families may not be aware of the abuse and they may not have discussed it with anybody else.  It is unusual to get a call where a person has not discussed the abuse, but on occasion we are the first person to be told that abuse took place.  Those us who take those calls are very conscious of how difficult and traumatic it is for the people making the calls.  <\/p> <p>  We will examine our documents to determine whether what happened meets the threshold, as I explained earlier.  If it does, and once it is sexual abuse, it is over the threshold and will be reported to State agencies.  We provide State agencies with as much information as we have been given and explain the process to the caller.  We advise callers that what they have told us is confidential but if they tell us something that we have a legal obligation to report then we have to do that.  We qualify that and make it clear that the decision on whether to make a criminal complaint lies with the person.  If a person tells us he or she does not want to talk to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla, we tell him or her that is fine.  However, we have a legal obligation to report information on abuse and we do so.

Given the nature of the report, a significant period will have to be allocated for anonymising and sanitising the document so it can be made public.  That also presents a difficulty because there are thresholds that have to be met from a legal perspective.  I understand that but I wanted to put it on the record because it is worthy of being said.  It has been said to me enough by members of the scouting movement, locally and nationally.<\/p><p> I have some technical questions on the operation of Scouting Ireland.

Therefore, he is not an independent person.  I get that being an interim safeguarding manager is separate from having the role of looking back, which Mr. Elliott is perfectly capable of doing, but I am not convinced that the obligation regarding independence, which others have commented on in recent months, particularly Dr. Shannon, was fulfilled.

On a weekly basis, we would have contact with staff in Tusla discussing individual cases, if not once or twice, maybe three times a week.  In my view, we have a good working relationship with the staff in Tusla.  It is extremely important that we have that.  In addition, we have tripartite meetings between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla and Scouting Ireland.  Since March of this year, we have had three of those meetings.  The purpose of those meetings is to ensure that any issues that arise are addressed.  We deal with more strategic issues in those meetings, but the day-to-day contact would generally be with case officers who are dealing with cases that either have been referred to Tusla directly or we have made disclosures and they are doing their assessment based on the information we have.  From our perspective, we do everything to try to assist the people in Tusla in doing their work.

From figures circulating in the media, we note that 321 alleged victims and 247 alleged perpetrators have been identified.  I would have contacted Scouting Ireland myself back in October out of pure and utter frustration, because we were waiting to find a slot for it to come before us.  There were \"Prime Time\" programmes airing and everything else.  I asked a number of questions.  Scouting Ireland has definitely gone very corporate.  I will say that for nothing, because my response came from Dubheasa Kelly, the information and communications manager of Scouting Ireland, to a number of questions I would have asked.  I am sure Mr. Tennant is aware of all these questions and he has probably had sight of the response.<\/p> <p>  An interesting part of the response that I got was something I had not been aware of.  We have all talked around the 321 alleged victims and the 247 alleged perpetrators.  The questions I posed were: Is it known how many files are in existence and if so, how many?  Will Mr. Elliott investigate\/include these files and, if not, when will these files be investigated?  The response to this was that as of 29 March 2019, Scouting Ireland's safeguarding department held 999 files.  All these files were catalogued as described above.  Earlier, when Scouting Ireland was asked about how many files were in Larch Hill in 2012, the answer was 332.  My question today is how did the number of files increase from 332 to 995, which is a multiple of three since 2012.  How did this come about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019120400002#L02800","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I will pass Deputy Rabbitte over to the CEO for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019120400002#L02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Tennant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>As Deputy Rabbitte will know, we provided the numbers extensively to the committee and to her.

While they are different from what arose 30 or 40 years ago, they are no less worthy of a professional response.  As I stated at a previous meeting of the committee, we open approximately 70 files per year, and they accumulate all the time.  As Mr. Ian Elliott commented in one of his earlier reports, it is a sign of the health of the organisation when we receive more reports.

The F&oacute;rsa delegation today consists of myself, head of health and welfare division, and my staff colleagues at the F&oacute;rsa national health office: Mr. Chris Cully, Ms Catherine Keogh and Mr. Diarmaid Mac a Bhaird.  F&oacute;rsa represents more than 30,000 workers in the public and voluntary health sector across a broad diversity of grades, groups and categories.  A large portion of the F&oacute;rsa-represented workforce consists of health and social care professionals including physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, podiatrists, psychologists, social workers, social care workers, pharmacists, physicists, audiologists and orthoptists.  This list is far from exhaustive.  F&oacute;rsa also represents a very large cohort of clerical, administrative and management grades.<br\/><br\/>The concept of workforce planning is widely accepted as planning to place the right number of people with the right skills in the right place at the right time.  In the area of healthcare, this should be designed with the sole ambition of providing improved patient outcomes which, in turn, deliver better care and improved quality of life.  There are a number of contributing factors which militate against effective healthcare workforce planning and thus bring about a much-reduced capacity to achieve such improved patient outcomes.<br\/><br\/>To address taking a step back and reactive planning, the Irish health sector has been pieced together over 90 years as a composite of State and voluntary services.  It has traditionally been dominated by the acute hospital sector.  It is, at best, disjointed.  The Irish health service is resourced with highly-competent workers who work honestly and diligently.  However, such diligence is often compromised by a systems failure which consequently fails to deliver the required levels of improved patient outcomes.  The social and political measurement of the performance of our health services is often based upon the number of patients waiting on hospital trolleys and the length of hospital waiting lists.  This crude measurement leads to reactive and pressure-based planning. The cyclical nature of system failure and reactive planning will never bring about an integrated healthcare system which focuses on health promotion and improvement, community-based health intervention and appropriate acute hospital healthcare.  Effective workforce planning requires taking a step back and planning to resource the type of health system envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare model.<br\/><br\/>The current model whereby the annual funding allocation is distributed is not fit for purpose for an effective integrated healthcare system.  Inevitably, as overspends arise, a cap-in-hand approach applies in whatever area of healthcare is attracting the most noise at a particular point in time.  For example, if a particular controversy arises in mental health, unplanned supplementary resources are provided to ease political pressure.  This approach can only lead to turf warfare in funding and, accordingly, we will never get to a point where preventive interventions realise their full value to society.  If the fundamental principles of Sl&aacute;intecare are to be achieved, multiannual budgeting will be a necessity.<br\/><br\/>The responsibility for recruitment of staff lies with national recruitment services, NRS.  NRS is resourced with a cohort of highly-dedicated staff and is, quite simply, operating way beyond its capacity to generate timely staff recruitment.  NRS is inhibited by rules surrounding the recruitment licence in addition to the sheer size of the task of recruiting staff on a national basis.  Furthermore, the lack of a formal staff mobility policy ensures that there is a residue of workers seeking geographical relocation while at the same time residing on placement panels from which they are offered positions in areas outside of a geographical preference.  A mobility policy would greatly ease the pressure on the system in this regard.  The crude instrument of a recruitment freeze also introduces layer upon layer of derogation processes which take months to overcome, leaving vital posts remaining vacant or the utilisation of agency workers at a demonstrably higher cost to the State.<br\/><br\/>There exists a chronic situation with regard to vacant health and social care professional, HSCP, posts.  The direct effect of this is felt by patients in need of interventions. The rate of churn of HSCPs is in excess of 7%, second only to hospital consultants.  The Sl&aacute;intecare model references the need for an additional 1,400 HSCPs.  This figure does not even take into account the number of alarming and critical gaps in the current structure.  As we seek to move to a model which places more emphasis on community-based health intervention which frees up acute hospital services to deliver what is needed in that area, HSCP recruitment cannot simply be an option.  Without significant HSCP recruitment, the model simply will not get beyond the starting line.  On an ongoing basis, the built-in excess whole-time equivalent planning which applies to cover maternity and parental leave in nursing should apply to HSCPs as 80% of HSCP staff are female.  Additionally, there should be automatic progression from basic to senior grade therapist after five years' practice, subject to competency validation.  This would be of great benefit to isolated rural areas as a therapist who has built up an intervention-patient relationship would not need to move from that rural area to attain career progression.  There is also a clear need for a HSCP advocate in the Department of Health, which would operate in its own stream and not within a nursing reporting arrangement.<br\/><br\/>With regard to community healthcare organisation, CHO, primary care networks, F&oacute;rsa has given its support and co-operation to the establishment of nine learning sites, one per existing CHO, in the area of primary care.  The establishment of the nine learning sites brings about significant change in the way HSCPs currently work.  In order for the learning sites to succeed, they must be adequately staffed.  If the Minister for Health&rsquo;s proposal to create six integrated care organisations to replace the current configuration of nine CHOs and seven hospital groups comes about, it is likely that the network model trialled in the nine learning sites will continue.  It is therefore imperative that, if the nine sites are deemed to be a success with adequate staffing, growth into more geographical networks are adequately staffed in the same way.<br\/><br\/>On clerical, administrative and managerial grades, there is an accepted lazy narrative in social and political circles that the health sector is awash with administrative staff and managers.  This is neither true nor fair.  In fact, the proportional number of administrative staff in the Irish health sector is lower than in many international comparators.  Clerical staff are charged with tasks such as paying the wages of doctors and nurses and are often the first point of contact for members of the public.  The acceptance of the narrative referenced above is demoralising for this group of workers, many of whom bore the biggest brunt of the cull in staff numbers during the financial crisis, at great personal cost.  <br\/><br\/>Health sector managers are vilified for lack of performance and accountability whereas, in reality, the system is failing due to <i>ad hoc<\/i>planning.  F&oacute;rsa is supportive of a performance system for senior managers as such a system would at least protect senior managers from a generic allegation which is made without any real basis.  It would be hard to find, for example, many workers in the health system with as onerous a responsibility as that borne by heads of social care in the CHO structure.  In fact, the dangerous level of risk borne by these workers has been independently verified.  Recently there was an announcement in the national media, without any reference to this union, of the need to whittle down the number of managers in the system.  This assumption is made without any meaningful analysis.  In fact, this approach was tried before, resulting in a massive deficit of corporate and intellectual knowledge which, in turn, generated a subsequent re-establishment of previous numbers.<br\/><br\/>F&oacute;rsa once again thanks the committee for its attention and time.  We will endeavour to answer any questions members may have either today or in further correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donnelly for his presentation and I thank the delegation for its time and for coming here today.

Mr. Donnelly has gone through some areas.  I will ask him a broad question to begin with.  For the sake of the workers F&oacute;rsa represents and the services they provide, we need to see proper multiannual workforce planning.  We should know how many people we need at particular grades, with particular skill sets, and in different services in different parts of the country.  We should be accounting for maternity leave, training, and mobility around the country.  We should be treating our staff very well so that our retention rates would be high.  The HSE should be a fantastic place to work because, first and foremost, that would provide the best outcomes for patients and, secondly but also extremely importantly, because everyone should a have decent workplace.  That is the ideal.  Some countries are good at it and some are not.  Some parts of the public sector are good at it and some are not.<\/p><p>Some companies are good at it and some are not.

We cannot separate multi-annual workforce planning from multi-annual budgeting.

We are currently in a big state of flux.  If everything was to stay the same, which we know it will not because it cannot, one might get away with the cap in hand approach year on year.  However, if we were serious about, for example, relieving the pressure on acute hospital healthcare and were to allow acute hospitals to deliver acute healthcare and to have proper interventions in the community, we would need to have a multi-annual approach both from a budgetary point of view and a workforce planning point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>From a workforce planning perspective, Mr. Donnelly is not seeing that anywhere in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#D00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>No.  What we are seeing - this is not a criticism but an observation because we tend to work with what we have - is the machine can only plan one year at a time because we do not know what Sl&aacute;intecare will bring about, and that is more of a inhibitor than a motivator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Are there parts of it that are under particular pressure or that are particularly bad at workforce planning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#D00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I would say that primary care is not great.

I had a conversation with an employer in one provider that was considering moving from being a section 39 to a section 38 organisation and they were excited about that because of the cuts that had been applied to staff that had not been reversed for section 39 organisations.  They thought they might get some breathing space if they were to become a section 38 organisation but they were warned about that by others organisations and told they should be careful because if they were to do that they would fall under the dreaded control of the national recruitment service which they were told was a nightmare as it can take a year and a half to hire anybody.  First, it is a problem for the organisation in that it cannot get the people it needs when it needs them and, second, most people who have options, who are the type of people an organisation would want to hire, do not hang around for a year and a half.

First, the Deputy referenced the section 39 agencies.  It is F&oacute;rsa's view that the funding model for section 39 agencies should be in line with our caring at what cost policy, a robust State funding model.  There might be some advantages in an agency having autonomy but there are many disadvantages in having to go cap in hand to its funders every year to see if it can still provide a service.<\/p> <p>  The national recruitment service was created in Manorhamilton in Leitrim as part of a Government agenda to bring work to isolated rural areas; we are supportive of that.  It is an urban town in a very rural country.  Manorhamilton has a very good cohort of staff but the service is only operating at half capacity.  It is F&oacute;rsa's view that clerical and administrative recruitment should be taken out of Manorhamilton and put into the community.  Clerical and administrative workers have a generic skill set and are easier than other staff to move around.  The service received 21,000 applications for the basic grade of clerical officer.  Nobody in the Manorhamilton office will be able to handle that.  If appointments were dedicated to, say, nursing, midwifery and health and social care professional recruitment, that would ease the pressure on Manorhamilton somewhat.  In addition, when an invisible moratorium, which effectively is a moratorium, is introduced and one has to jump through layer upon layer of derogation, that makes the recruitment job for national recruitment service nigh on impossible.

It is never perfect but there is a pride in being in the workforce and a general sense that the employer has the worker's back most of the time.  One aspect that strikes me about the HSE, the Irish public health care system, is that it is opposite of that.  There is a total lack of trust and a breakdown in the relationship between the employer - I do not mean individual local employers but the HSE, the ultimate paymaster - and front-line workers.  It seems to be chronic or it may be that all the disgruntled people talk to me.  We seem to be an outlier and it is for doctors, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, primary care workers, health and social care professions.  It seems to be across the system.  Is there something we can do from the State&rsquo;s perspective to rebuild trust so that the workers F&oacute;rsa represents feel valued, respected and listened to and can have a great sense of pride that they work for Ireland&rsquo;s public healthcare system and, ultimately, can have a bit of trust that their organisation has their back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#D01300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I am not sure the problem is as easily analysed as saying there is a complete breakdown of trust.

This values the work the physiotherapist does and cuts waiting lists, and, if we are simplistic about it, at a lower cost to the Exchequer, which is good.

It is a real problem in the Civil Service.

I will try my best.  Before I came back to the health sector in the trade union movement, I was actually in the Civil Service.  They spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to analyse performance.  Do I believe there should be performance accountability in the Civil Service?  Absolutely, yes.  We are on record as the only trade union to offer ourselves up for that.  Every St. Stephen's Day I hear on the radio that there are 672 people on trolleys and straightaway the hospital manager is blamed.  How can a hospital manager in that capacity stop 672 people being on trolleys when it is a systems failure?  I would rather for that hospital manager to be protected by a performance management and accountability system; it would make more sense.  That should apply to workers.<\/p> <p>  It is quite simple with health and social care professionals.  At the turn of this century in 2000 there was no career structure whatsoever because a physiotherapist was a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist was an occupational therapist.  Speech and language therapy barely existed.  When people had strokes they were almost losses to society.  The world has changed and we have the skills available.  As a result of our co-operation with the new community health structures, we are in the process of reviewing the career pathway for health and social care professionals.  <\/p> <p>  We should not underestimate how important it would be to see automatic progression from basic rate to senior grade therapist because it touches on some of the things the Deputy has mentioned.  It must be validated that the therapist is competent so it is linked to performance.  I will use the example of Leitrim and Longford again.  Someone there may have developed a four or five-year relationship or connection with patients.  All of a sudden in order to access a senior grade he or she probably has to go to Sligo to follow where the population is to get on a panel and so on.<\/p> <p>  We are trying to convince our health and social care professionals, apart from the value to the patient of clinical specialisms, advanced practitioning, that maybe at some stage in their career they might need to say, \"I'm going to actually use my expertise and put down my tools.  I'm actually going to populate posts that are responsible for service planning and delivery.  All this stuff you talk about in terms of how you view a service, I'm going to bring my clinical expertise to this.\"  We then need the creation of directorates for the various professions.  If we had a vision set out like that, remaining on as a health and social care professional in this country would be a more attractive option.  Many of our people look the British National Health Service, NHS.  It is not quite like nurses and doctors where potential hospital consultants go to Australia; our people tend to go to Britain.  We could stem that tide very quickly if we had a pathway mapped for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their submission.  I agree on the need for managers to direct; we need a command system.  I feel that the command system has failed but I cannot put my finger on the reason for that.  For instance, if people are on trolleys in a hospital I immediately ask why they are there.  Is the hospital the appropriate place for them in the first instance?  Should there have been an interruption?  There is no sense in being vague about it and saying that primary care rests with the primary care area and they can get an equal or better service at home.  Unfortunately, it does not work that way.<\/p> <p>  To what extent is the healthcare system capable of dealing with the daily influx of patients into our hospitals?  We, as policymakers, were told for years that we did not need more hospital beds.  We need fewer hospital beds because the patients would be dealt with on a turnaround of two or three hours.  It did not happen.  It is not happening, nor is it likely to happen.<\/p> <p>  We now need somebody or some system to decide to intervene as soon as the patient arrives at the hospital in an ambulance and not to leave the ambulance outside the door with the engine running for three, four, five or ten hours as the case may be, and with five or six ambulances all lined up at the same time.  This is a total waste of resources.  It is a risk to the patient and it is unacceptable.  How can we intervene to stop that?  I believe we need to find out where the logjam in the system lies.  What is stopping the first patient who arrives in the hospital that morning from being processed instantly?<\/p> <p>  I know people will say that they have been triaged and they are now waiting for a bed.  This is also a total contradiction to what we were told years ago when we were told there was no need for beds and yet strangely we now need 3,000 beds.<\/p><p>I do not know if we have the information readily available to us but we would need it at this level.  We would need to know what is going on in the various hospitals throughout the country, what is holding up the queue in the morning time, and what is forcing patients to be accommodated in corridors, in waiting areas and in generally unsupervised situations in the hospitals.

First, about managers, I want to be clear that managers form less than 1.5% of the entire health workforce.  The percentage is low by comparison with international comparators.  I was talking about the poor individual soul who is charged with the entire responsibility of running a hospital such as Portlaoise who, as soon as there is a logjam, should be held to account, and that would will never work.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan is absolutely right.  Bed capacity was always an issue.  I do not know how it was decided that bed capacity should be reduced.  The question is who is in the beds.  I have personal experience of my own mother being in one for four months - when, quite clearly, what she needed was a step-down facility with a hoist to deal with her incapacity to get herself up in the morning - in a big hospital in Drogheda where there were trolleys all over the place.  Definitely bed capacity is one issue.<\/p> <p>  The number of people who land in accident and emergency is a problem.  I would say it is at best probably more than it should be.  I refer to the lack of primary care interventions and the referral system as well.  I do not know,  if one is ever to get Sl&aacute;intecare off the ground, whether we will ever tackle the general practitioner, GP, model but the entire referral system creates logjams in the hospital system because we have grown up over 90 years with a hospital-centric healthcare system and everything lands there.  Until we get away from that, one will have this.  One can increase the number of beds.  If one increases the number of beds by 3,000 one will have probably 1,500 fewer trolleys but one will not solve the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>The next issue is the staffing levels and the configuration of the staff.  I came across a situation recently where there was only one doctor available in a hospital.  I do not know who decided that.  I do not know how that came about but it should not happen.  If that is the way it is, there is a reason for it, we need to know what is the reason for it and we need to do something about it.  It is not a complex issue.  It is a simple issue.<\/p> <p>  If there were 80 patients waiting in a hospital area on Monday of last week, the presumption is that there would be a similar number next week and the week after unless something is done about it.  This is the problem.  We spend our time talking about this and going over and over it which is detrimental to those working in the service but we do not seem to identify the cause of the problem, and the cause of the problem has to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  From my own observation, we went through a hiatus in this country over the past ten years.  We went from a situation where almost 0.5 million people left the country and services were closed down due to very serious financial issues - there was no way around that and we were told what we had to do and we got to do it - to one where those people have come back with more.  If one tours around the various industrial hotspots of this city and the country in general and looks at the volume of heavy traffic on the roads in the morning about which we complain, the answer to the question as to where are all the heavy trucks coming from and what are they doing is that they are doing their business.  They are producing for home consumption or for export, whatever the case may be.  It naturally follows that the health service must compete and cater for a much bigger market than it did 11 or 12 years ago.  If we do not do that and we do not identify the most immediate issues upfront, we are missing out and we will talk about it forever.<\/p> <p>  I should say that I am a strong advocate of community care.  I was a member of a health board in the past.  I believe it was a better system because the inspiration for the response came from the ground up where the GPs were involved, where the pharmacists were involved, where the nurses where involved and where the psychiatric system was involved.  Everybody was involved in a consultative capacity at the coalface.  That is all gone and it is now centralised.  The theory is that centralisation is a more effective and efficient method for delivering services.  It is not.<\/p> <p>  This is the last point I want to make on that.  I refer to recruitment and attraction to the system.  I see no reason we cannot have temporary appointments instead of agency staff.  The temporary appointment - while waiting for the permanent appointment to be approved - could fill the space, provide the service and deliver the service to the public which is what we are supposed to do.  We are not an employment agency.  We are deliverers of service.  We require employers to deliver the service.  Unless it becomes policy to utilise the temporary appointment, we are at nothing.  I am not asking Mr. Donnelly to make a political statement on this.

First, it is cheaper.  Second, they do not accrue permanent employment rights for four years.  If one cannot get it right in four years, one is struggling.<\/p> <p>  I agree that a centralised system has not worked out.  We would be great advocates of the six regional authorities with a scaled-down HSE so long as those authorities do not become hospital dominated.

We have experience of seeking for a post to be filled, for example, for a maternity cover, and it taking nine months to get approval.  If one has a front-line situation where one needs to have the post filled, if it will take nine months what one will do in the meantime is take in an agency person.

There is a proportionality issue as well.  If we employ 10,000 new staff over a period of time, there must be a proportional number of those proposed for the coalface as well as the administration level.  What the proportions are varies from one discipline to another but it is important to recognise that there is no use employing 10,000 administrators and no medical staff.<\/p> <p> On the slowness of the appointments, I both accept and do not accept it.

The longer a person is kept waiting, the more expensive the system becomes.  We need to address that as a matter of urgency.  To conclude, there is no sense in having 100,000 administrators if their numbers are out of proportion to those at the coalface.  It is not going to work.  It cannot work.  We can have all the people in the world telling us what should be done and when, but there must be operatives with the required expertise at the coalface, putting their fingers on the various sensitive areas to identify how the flow can be best assisted.  I am not sure that we have done that.  We have not done that for a long time.  We need those people to move the queue along.

We are suggesting that we should be valued for what we do.  If a patient presents himself or herself to cardiology, somebody has to hand the consultant the chart and make sure that chart is accurate and reflects the proper medical histology.  Is that or is that not a part of the coalface?  It is classified as administration.  Ms Keogh already referenced home help co-ordinators.

It is a difficult area.  There are so many different areas in the health service, including doctors, nurses, care assistants, cleaners, porters and administrators.  It is complex.  One problem I see with the health service is that everyone is fighting their own battle.  There is a huge problem.  There is no team effort.  I have come across a few cases where nurses were not given support when there was an adverse outcome.  I was really disappointed when somebody recently came before the committee and spoke about the lack of support offered when there is an adverse outcome.  That applies to administrative people, nursing staff and doctors.  That puts people on the defensive for the rest of their lives.  Their attitude is shaped by the experience of not getting support when they needed it.  I am really worried about that in the health service.  That has happened time and time again to people I know who work in the health service.  We need to work on that.<\/p> <p>  This is not a criticism; it is just an observation.  Since December 2014 the number of staff in the HSE has increased to 135,000.  It has increased by 16,000 full-time staff.  Meanwhile there is a perception out there that an embargo is in place and no new staff are being taken on.  It is unfortunate that this impression has taken hold among the public as if nothing has been done.  Actually 16,000 additional full-time staff have been taken on.  That is a huge increase in staff numbers.  However, during that five-year period there does not appear to have been a plan outlining which crucial areas needed more employees.  It appears to have been a case of who shouted the loudest.  That is my worry.  <\/p> <p>  I will come back to the issue of administrative staff.  This is not a criticism, because I know a lot of staff were laid off.  The actual number of administrative and management staff has gone from 15,030 in December 2014 to 18,600 in March 2019, the last time for which I have figures.  That is a 24% increase.  I have no problem with that.  My problem is that this was disproportionate.  There was an overall increase of 17% in the number of HSE staff but administration and management increased by 24%.  I have a problem with the fact that the number of public health nurses only increased by 3.7%.  It appears that no-one was fighting their corner.  Public health nurses play a very important part.<\/p> <p>  This is not a criticism of administration and management.  However, it appears there was no plan which took account of numbers and of needs for the next 12 months or two years and determined how to use the budget.  That is one of my concerns.  I do not know the witnesses' views on that.  It does not appear to have been a priority.  The public perception is that there are fewer doctors and nurses but that is not the case.  In fact there are more doctors.  Comparing the current figures to those of 2009 shows that we have gone from 7,000 doctors in the HSE to 9,000.  That includes consultants, the number of which has risen from 2,100 to more than 3,100.  The number of junior doctors has also increased by more than 1,000.  The number of care assistants has increased, which is a huge advantage because they provide a very good service.  That number has increased by 2,000.  I am still concerned.  No-one is saying at the start of the year that we need an extra 500 care assistants.  The increase seems to have happened in bits and pieces around the country.  From their own dealings on this issue, what are the witnesses' observations?  Some 16,000 additional staff is a huge number to take on without any overall corporate plan.  Certainly if a private enterprise decided to take on 16,000 people there would be a clear two-year, three-year, four-year or five-year plan.  That does not appear to have been in place.

Members may have read in <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>the week before last about the director general's announcement of a targeted redundancy for managers.  That throws everything into the mix.  As an advocate of workforce planning I say that if that is what is required, that is what we will deal with.  However, there must be some analysis of whether this is the right fit before we make sweeping statements.  This is what I keep saying.<br\/><br\/>If members wish to consider this after our session I would draw their attention to the HSE staff census in 2009, when we were really bankrupt.  The reason there has been a 23% or 24% increase in the number of managers is that those roles faced the biggest cull at that time.  The proportionate increase is from a much lower base.  Moreover, a redundancy package was part of that cull.  That one crude instrument removed a pile of corporate knowledge.  Then people wondered where the knowledge had gone.  The result was that people were rehired on a consultancy basis into positions that had been deemed fit for redundancy.  This caused a bigger spend.  That is not right.  I am all for embracing the problem.  If people think we are awash with managers, let us analyse it and have an adult conversation about it.  We cannot proceed on the mere statement that the number has increased by 24%.  There is a deeper-rooted history to that. <br\/><br\/>Secondly, if the Senator is talking about increasing the workforce I agree with him.  The fact of the matter, however, is that we have a bigger population.

Again, if one increased the HSE's staff headcount one might be in a different position.

Local authorities present a five-year plan that outlines what they want to develop but that is not done in the health service.  We have Sl&aacute;intecare but we still need an overall plan.  Mr. Donnelly made a valid point about many people ending up in accident and emergency units who should not be there at all.  We need to consider how to deal with the issue.  There are super clinics in other countries that offer a range of services.  The minor injuries unit in St. Mary's Health Campus in Cork works very effectively and takes approximately 8,500 people out of the accident and emergency departments in the Mercy University Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Maybe we should consider a similar scene for around the country.  Well over 75% of the people who present at accident and emergency units do not require a hospital stay.  Yes, they require some care and treatment but they do not need a hospital bed.  We need to work out how to move those people away from accident and emergency units into a proper care provision without clogging up the hospital system.<\/p> <p>  Forward planning seems to have disappeared and, by way of explanation, I will outline one of my big criticisms of the current recruitment of consultants.  In the past the old health boards were aware that a consultant would retire in a particular year and 12 months before that a recruitment process would be put in place.  Now we seem to wait until the person retires, then a locum is selected to cover for the consultant and only then the recruitment process is undertaken.  Do witnesses know from their own experiences any way that process can be changed?  Nurses are recruited in similar fashion.  No one thinks outside the box when it comes to the recruitment and retention of staff in a whole range of areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#H00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Frankly, with the way things are at the moment, if we lose a therapist it could take nine months to replace him or her.

I was working in Athlone that day so I returned to work after a plaster of Paris was applied to my arm and before I left the hospital I was given a note to go to Beaumont Hospital as I live in Dublin.  When I went to Beaumont Hospital I had to queue again but this time in its accident and emergency department.  Therefore, I visited two accident and emergency units with one broken arm.  Before I left the county hospital I was given a CD that contained copies of my X-ray.  When I presented my CD to the staff in Beaumont Hospital a couple of days later they could not read the CD so they had to cut my plaster and perform another X-ray.  My arm was X-rayed, a diagnosis made and plaster of Paris reapplied but I needlessly clogged up the unit in Beaumont Hospital for four or five hours.<\/p> <p>  Earlier my colleague, Ms Cully, referred to the definition of administrative grades.

The senior posts are those in respect of which one finds this happening in the most.  These are done as a national panel.  Let us say that I am a senior occupational therapist, OT, and I want to become a senior OT as a basic grade.  I see a national panel and I apply for it.  Equally, I am already a senior OT but want to move to a different area geographically and the only way I can do so is by applying for the national panel.  In 2016, in the case of 20-odd positions - we can share this information with the committee because the HSE has shared it with us - a great amount of work was done by the NRS to qualify 425 active candidates for an OT panel which ran for three years.  There are still 400 people on that panel because most of those who were offered jobs did not want them because they were not in the right geographical areas.  We were given figures at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which indicate that 50% to 60% of any panel at any time is made up of already established HSE staff.  From an administrative and resource point of view, a great amount of work goes into qualifying all of these people, when they do not really want to be on the relevant panel.  They want to be on transfer panels, which is understandable.  They are young, they qualify from college, they take their first jobs and they may want to move back home due to family commitments and all that goes with such commitments.  Following two extensions, the 2016 panel with the 425 qualified candidates on it expired on 10 October last.  Those 425 people are still looking to be moved around the country and they have nowhere to go.  They will start being reinterviewed next year in order to be placed on another panel.  A supplementary panel with 224 people on it now takes over.  The NRS will start working its way down through that, offering jobs to people because there is no geographical alignment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K02500","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>It is offering jobs to people who are going to turn them down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K02600","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":587,"content":"<p>Yes, because is no-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K02700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":588,"content":"<p>They are not qualified on the basis of geography.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K02800","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>They are qualified based on the fact that they can do the job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K02900","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>When I say that they have not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K03000","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>There is no way - this is what we have been pushing for - other than to bring it back to a geographical level so that one can-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K03100","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>The recruiters are not qualifying the candidates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K03200","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>To be fair, the recruiters are qualifying the candidates for roles, posts and competencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K03300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>They are not qualifying them, however, on the basis of geography.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019120400002#K03400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>The Health Business Services has to offer these posts as they arise on the basis of expressions of interest.

The Bill was published on 21 November and, as Deputies are aware, concluded its passage through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last week.  I welcome the support received in the House for the core principle of community rating, which is a long established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market.  This is a short and technical Bill comprising six sections, all focused on the specific issue of health insurance regulation.  The provisions outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market, as well as health insurance policies at an affordable price for all citizens, young or old and sick or healthy.<\/p> <p>  To support community rating, which is one of the fundamental principles of Irish health insurance, legislation is needed each year to update and revise the scheme that enables the sharing of risk across the insured population.  As part of the process, the Health Insurance Authority, which is the independent market regulator, carries out an annual evaluation of the market focused on the claims cost that every insurer has paid over the year.  Based on this analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits and stamp duties that should apply the following year in order that risk may be shared across the market and the principle of community rating is maintained.  The rates for next year recommended by the authority have been considered and accepted by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  This year's Bill will provide for a general decrease in the credits across genders and age groups and there will be some changes in the stamp duty levies on contracts.<\/p> <p>  The stamp duty in respect of products providing advanced cover will be slightly increased by &euro;5 to &euro;449 per adult and by &euro;2 to &euro;150 per child.  The stamp duty in respect of products providing non-advanced cover will be reduced by &euro;20 to &euro;157 per adult and by &euro;7 to &euro;52 per child.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note there has been no increase in stamp duty on health insurance contracts for the past two years so this 1% increase for policyholders with advanced contracts is not only necessary to support more affordable policies for older and less healthy people but is also extremely modest as the first increase in three years, bearing in mind much more significant increases in years gone by.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, the Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is a long-established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#B00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575417600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 has been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#B00800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575417600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575417600,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575417600,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Sections 3 to 6, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I do not have a copy of the Bill in front of me.

People who take out private health insurance go through a checklist with the insurance company and are asked which tertiary hospital they are most likely to attend.  People like me from Roscommon will be asked whether we want to go to Galway or Dublin and a number of private hospitals are listed.  It has recently come to my attention that the insurance companies do not provide cover in all of the model 2 hospitals.  I can understand with regard to a model 4 hospital if people want expert care for a heart attack they are asked whether they would go to the Mater Hospital, the Beacon Hospital, the Galway Clinic or the Blackrock Clinic but the insurance companies should not refuse cover in small hospitals such as those in Ennis, Roscommon, Mallow or Bantry.  People should automatically get cover in these hospitals.<\/p> <p>  I presume the reason the insurance companies are selective is because there are expensive fees in some of the big private hospitals but there are standard charges for level 2 hospitals in the country.  We should be actively encouraging people to go into our level 2 hospitals because if they go to hospital in Bantry, Ennis, Nenagh or Roscommon it takes pressure off the model 3 and 4 hospitals throughout the country and takes pressure off our accident and emergency departments.  Admission charges for urgent care centres should be reduced to incentivise people to go to them rather than accident and emergency departments.  Every insurance company should be obliged to provide cover to the smaller local hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The reason this has come to my attention is a private patient who attended Roscommon hospital found out when the insurance claim went in that the policy did not cover the local hospital.  That person ended up having to pay.  This causes two problems.  People must pay out of their own pockets because they do not have the cover and they are discouraged from supporting their local hospital.  There is an anomaly that is being exploited by the insurance industry at present.  I am giving notice that I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage.  I hope that in advance of Report Stage this anomaly can be addressed in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#B01400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.

People have cover in some level 2 hospitals.  Why, for argument's sake, would people living in Roscommon have cover in Bantry hospital but not Roscommon hospital?  I cannot understand it.  There does not seem to be justification for it with regard to level 2 hospitals.  I fully understand why insurance companies would ask people whether they want cover in all of the more expensive high-level hospitals and what level of cover they want but local people are sometimes not being made aware of the fact that their own local hospital is not covered by the insurance policy.  It should not come down to people having to specifically name a hospital.  For example, if I am on holidays in west Cork, why should I not go to Bantry hospital rather than go to Cork where there will be problems in the accident and emergency department?  We should encourage people to use our level 2 hospitals as a policy decision by the Government.<\/p><p>Insurance companies should not discriminate against any level 2 hospital.  If we can get increased volumes of elective surgery in our small hospitals everyone benefits.  It makes no sense from a policy point of view and the insurance industry should not be allowed to exclude any level 2 hospital in terms of cover.  There is no justification for it.

The enhanced focus on financial management in 2019 is particularly important given the uncertainties arising in regard to Brexit.  Over the past five years, the majority of additional health funding has been allocated to pay cost pressures associated with Government pay policy and to maintain existing levels of service, taking account of demographic changes.  These allocations are balanced with new developments, seeking to continuously improve the Irish health system.  In addition, the growing costs arising from pensions and the State Claims Agency must also be addressed.  <\/p><p>I will now set out the items which make-up this year's Supplementary Estimate.  In March, the Government agreed to the establishment of an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme for those affected by the non-disclosure of the CervicalCheck audit.  The scheme is designed to provide an alternative, non-adversarial and person-centred option for those affected by the CervicalCheck non-disclosure issue.  To date, 161 of the 221 cohort identified have made applications and all have been paid.  In addition, the CervicalCheck tribunal was set up in July to provide an alternative system for dealing with claims arising from CervicalCheck, reducing the adversarial nature of hearings for the women and families affected.<\/p><p>On pensions, for which &euro;24 million is sought, the budget allocation to cover superannuation costs in the HSE for 2019 is &euro;490 million, inclusive of the first charge from 2018 of &euro;24 million.  While expenditure on superannuation during 2018 has been broadly in line with expectation, there was no scope to offset the incoming first charge.  On the winter programme, &euro;26 million is sought for the 2019-20 winter plan, with additional funding for the 2020 impact included in the HSE's national service plan for 2020.  This funding is crucial to reducing overcrowding pressures in our hospitals and will deliver additional home care packages, transitional care beds, necessary aids and appliances and will allow for the activation of winter action teams to manage unscheduled care performance through various initiatives.  Demand for acute hospital services exceeded the resources available in 2018, resulting in the system entering 2019 at an expenditure level beyond the approved level of funding.  This was to be addressed through achieving affordable levels of staffing and other savings outlined in the service plan.  However, demand continued to grow in 2019 and this countered the impact of any targeted savings achieved and, along with the growth in costs associated with the management of antimicrobial resistance and infection control, contributed to the estimated funding shortfall by year end of &euro;50 million.<\/p><p>A further &euro;50 million is sought for disability services.  The deficit within disability services arises from demand for emergency placements, an increase in the provision of home support hours to help alleviate the urgent demand for placements, the changing needs of clients in receipt of services and regulatory compliance.  All such factors create significant pressures within disability services, resulting in considerable challenges in maintaining affordable levels of service.<\/p><p> A further &euro;43 million is sought for the nursing agreement.  It will assist with the recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives in the public health service.  Significant funding will be provided for a range of tangible and specific enhanced nursing practice measures, including an enhanced practice role for nurses and midwives, increases in allowances and an extension of a range of allowances.  The implementation of the framework on a safe staffing and skills mix is also a key to the agreement, and a &euro;5 million investment will be made to continue its implementation.  It is anticipated that the agreement will achieve savings through a reduction of agency spend where the framework is in place and through productivity measures in the new enhanced practice role.  The HSE has a detailed implementation plan in place and a report on all aspects of the agreement, including savings, should be available in the new year.<\/p><p> A further &euro;3 million is sought for the job evaluation scheme for support staff.  The funding will ensure that the relevant grades of support staff are uplifted to the recommended pay bands using the methodology and timeframes set out in the Labour Court recommendations.<\/p><p> The State Claims Agency has a statutory responsibility to manage claims to ensure that the State's liability under the clinical indemnity and the general insurance schemes, with their associated legal and other expenses, is contained at the lowest achievable level.  Its role also includes the successful recovery of costs from third parties.  The agency has informed the Department that, in actuarial terms, the clinical indemnity scheme, established in 2003, has yet to reach maturity and is not expected to plateau in respect of volume and cost of clinical claims until 2020 at the earliest.  We are informed that the increasing costs of the clinical indemnity scheme are not due to the increasing numbers of claims but rather to the increasing costs of awards and the high costs associated with catastrophic injury claims.  In addition, payments relating to historical Medical Defence Union, MDU, have to be taken into consideration.  Such payments arise due to an arrangement put in place in 2005 between the then Minister for Health and Children, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation to ensure that in the event of an adverse clinical incident involving medical negligence, no patient would be left uncompensated and no doctor who was a member of the MDU would be left without indemnity insurance cover in the event that the MDU refused to indemnify him or her.  Under the arrangement, a consultant can request the assistance of the Minister in meeting the cost of damages arising from a claim.  The State Claims Agency manages the claims.  Subsequently, in settlement of litigation related to indemnity cover, the MDU paid the State &euro;45 million.  Due to a recent High Court action that was settled, relating to an MDU case, a final lump sum payment of &euro;17.5 million will be paid out of the Department&rsquo;s Vote in early December.<\/p><p> A further &euro;13 million is sought for Brexit planning,  In 2019, the Department and the agencies under its aegis, in particular the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, were required to be proactive in preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit by ensuring that detailed contingency measures were in place.<\/p><p> A further &euro;157 million is sought or the primary care reimbursement service, &euro;77 million of which is to fund the 2018 first charge, with &euro;80 million to fund the 2019 current deficit, which was primarily driven by overruns in the high-tech arrangement and the long-term illness scheme.<\/p><p> A further &euro;45 million is sought for appropriations-in-aid.  They are received by Ireland from the UK in respect of health services provided under EU regulations.  Following discussions, a sum of &euro;270 million was agreed for 2019, a surplus of &euro;45 million over the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, amount.  The surplus will offset the gross supplementary requirement of &euro;383.1 million, resulting in a net Exchequer supplementary of &euro;338.1 million.<\/p><p> In summary, the Supplementary Estimate seeks to address the funding requirement arising from decisions made subsequent to the national service plan, particularly central wage agreements and shortfalls arising from increases in eligible demand for medications, access to overseas treatments and the overrun in settlements by the State Claims Agency.  The new leadership team in the HSE has succeeded in maintaining the additional pressures in the health sector at less than half the level of last year.  In addition, the new HSE governance board is in the final stages of preparing a 2020 national service plan with improved health services for citizens, without carrying over a large financial overhang from this year.  Since the Supplementary Estimate was presented to the Government, however, additional costs associated with the State Claims Agency and pensions have emerged.  Both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform were conscious that this was a possibility, given the inherent forecasting risks associated with the demand-led areas.  The additional costs arising in 2019 will result in a first charge in 2020, which is currently under discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the 2020 REV to ensure there will be no impact on the service level set out in the HSE's national service plan.<\/p><p> The issue of sustainable health funding is a major challenge, not just in Ireland but internationally.  Dealing with a growing and ageing population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs, and the increasing cost of health technology will continue to pose a financial challenge into the future.  Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a new roadmap to support the delivery of high-quality care to our citizens, improving the way services are organised and delivered, and reducing costs to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs must remain our focus.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service continue to demonstrate good practice by delivering the best healthcare within the significant level of resources made available by the Government for 2020.<\/p><p> I seek the committee's approval for the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#C02100","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>The Minister of State looks younger every time he appears before the committee.

The health service is running over to the tune of approximately &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million per year of taxpayers' money.  Men and women work their backsides off to earn the money in order that the State can pay it.  There is yet again a massive overspend.  The children's hospital is massively overspent.  It is the job of the Oireachtas to interrogate the money.  That is the job we are supposed to do today, but we received the information with zero time to interrogate it for the second year in a row.  That says a great deal about the level of financial management and the view from within the Government as to how seriously it takes oversight of taxpayers' money.  It is an outrageous insult to every person in the country who pays tax or uses the hospital system.<\/p> <p>  The money involved is not really &euro;338 million.  By my count, it is closer to &euro;456 million because the &euro;338 million includes a reduction of &euro;45 million, due to a contract negotiation with the UK Government over treatment abroad schemes.<\/p><p>It has nothing to do with the provision of services.  It is just an unexpected negotiating quirk and an accounting issue, which reduces the total amount required but does not reduce the amount overspent.  When the additional &euro;45 million is added back in to try to get to the overspend one gets the &euro;383 million.  Then there is the extraordinary line of &euro;73 million which is also taken off the overspend for what they call time-related savings.  I was curious to understand, in the limited time we had to interrogate the documents, what time-related savings are.  It sounds like a good thing, that we have managed to reduce the overspend by &euro;73 million through such savings.  What it actually means is things that were meant to be done this year that did not happen.  Going through the document, page 6 refers to the &euro;73 million and says that time-related savings happen because facilities open later than they are supposed to, because negotiations to buy things take longer than they should and recruitment into designated roles does not happen as quickly as it should.  That &euro;73 million is, therefore, due to not doing things that the health service was meant to do and has nothing to do with the overspend.  One must then add that figure back in.  When the accounting quirk with the British Government is removed along with the item that is not a saving at all but is just not doing things on time, the overspend for running the show is north of &euro;450 million.<\/p><p> Before we get into the detail, then, I have a question.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, said that the overrun in health this year and in previous years is so big that it threatens the entire financial picture and the financial stability of the country.  It has done some very useful analysis on the overruns and their figures, not mine, are as follows: in 2005, the overspend was zero and there was no conversation on overruns; between 2006 and 2010, inclusive, it was also zero; between 2011 to 2013, inclusive, it started to increase to &euro;200 million, &euro;250 million, &euro;300 million; and for the past few years it has been averaging &euro;500 million a year.  The current Minister came into office in 2016.  Between 2015 and this year, the combined overrun is &euro;2.3 billion.  One question this committee must grapple with is how year after year, despite multi-billion euro increases to the health budget beyond anything that has ever been seen here or  in other countries, waiting lists are getting longer?  How is the Government spending more money at a phenomenal rate, up from about &euro;12.5 billion in 2014 or 2015 to &euro;18 billion next year but everything is getting so much worse so quickly for so many people?  Part of the answer is the overruns.  When one starts adding up &euro;500 million a year one gets to several billion euro that is expended on plugging gaps in places, not on service provision.  Before we get into the detail, what was going on that for the first five or six years of the HSE there were no overruns, then from 2011 they were modest and now we are up to annual averages of &euro;500 million?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#D00400","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>The Supplementary Vote that I seek approval for today is &euro;338.1 million in addition to what was outlined in 2019.  We can keep turning the figures and presenting them in different ways but that is what I am seeking approval for.  I do not want to muddy those waters.  I have outlined that &euro;115 million relates to an overspend from last year which I inherited this year and approximately &euro;90 million relates to decisions taken since.  That is either a prerogative that the Oireachtas would like to retain or we can absolve ourselves of.  I refer particularly to issues on which the Deputy was extraordinarily animated such as increasing pay for nursing staff - a political decision that was taken outside of the projections in last year's national service plan - and the CervicalCheck <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme.  That &euro;90 million resulted from political decisions taken by the Oireachtas and the Minister during that period.  As long as that facility is available, there will always be potential for an overrun.  We can have a debate over whether the Oireachtas should not have any say in the running of the health service and it should be as it is projected in 2019 or 2020 at the beginning of the year and we can accept that, but we cannot have it both ways.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked about the general overrun.  I cannot answer historically for the HSE about what happened in 2005 or 2006.  I was a county councillor at that time and had no involvement whatever in national politics.  I was a member of the regional health forum and that was as much input as I had into the health service then.  In general, as the Deputy knows well, it is a demand-led scheme.  Much of the money is spent on pay, on which there are many pressures and demands.  Politicians, from all sides, continuously demand pay increases and demand that we pay the people who work in the health service better.  It returns to my point that we can stick rigidly to the budgets.  I was here this time last year when there was an overspend of &euro;655 million.  We do not agree that is acceptable, we do not want that level of an overspend in the HSE, it is not our ambition and we are not satisfied with it.  To be fair to Paul Reid and his team in the HSE, and the team in the Department, I am here with an overrun of &euro;338 million rather than &euro;655 million.

Otherwise there is no sense in some of the rest of us coming in until the Opposition is finished.  I could come back tomorrow.  If the Chair gives me notice I will be quite happy to do that.<\/p> <p>  I want to draw attention to some of the fallacies in my colleague's remarks.  We have had a long debate about various new medicines becoming available.  There has been a strong debate in the House and outside of it, and we all know the demands that have been made in the course of the last year.  They are legitimate demands.  We have to listen to them and take them on board.  We also have to take on board the concerns of the patients and families who depend on these innovative medicines and are hoping for a reimbursement programme.  There is no sense in coming here at the end of the year and asking what all that was about, where it came from and what has gone wrong because we did not think about it before.  That is not acceptable behaviour at all.  This is nonsensical stuff.  We are having a debate that we should not have at all.  It is a waste of time.  We are returning to every item of expenditure on the basis that the children's hospital overrun is causing all the problems.  It is not.  If people had followed the debate that has taken place in this country in the past three years they would not have to ask those questions.  It is misleading to the general public to pretend that this is the answer to all their prayers.  If people want to say that we should not continue with the new children's hospital, by all means let them say it.  Let them embrace that ideology.  Let them come forward with it.  That puts an end to the debates.  They can then spend all the money that was going to be spent on the children's hospital elsewhere, provided, of course, that it meets the criteria.  However, fantasising in the committee or in the House about where money should be spent after it has been spent is a waste of time, energy and resources. <\/p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has opined on this issue.  That is correct.  I have listened to its opinions repeatedly.  The council has a job to do and I fully respect the need to stay within budget insofar as it is possible.  I suggest its officials should go to the hospitals and ask the patients on waiting lists and their families what should be done in respect of A, B, C or D as it affects them.  It is about time that we copped ourselves on.  We must get away from repeating colourful nonsense in the media.  I am not interested in that sort of thing.  I want to see something done directly about the subject in question.  There is a flaw in the system.  We need to identify a contingency sum in the health Estimates on an annual basis, one that is sufficient to meet the projected overrun in demand.<\/p> <p>  I note the figures for 2012, 2013 and 2014 as compared with 2007.  There was a vast difference in circumstances.  The country was broke in 2007 and it was very easy to come up with an Estimate that fell within the required levels, even though achieving that level left the country even more broke.  We have a situation now where we have to anticipate the growth in demand facing the system.  The health service is a demand-led service.  We have to make up our minds in this committee, in the House and in the debate nationally.  What do we want to do about it?  Do we intend to make a cool, calm and collected decision about what is required to run the services at the beginning of the year, given the number of imponderables likely to come before us?  The Chair has spoken about this, as we all have.  We need to cut out the pretence and actually identify it.  I believe that we should be budgeting for a higher level of excess expenditure, for want of a better description, in order to cater for the continuity of the services throughout the year.<\/p> <p>  There are two groups of people who can deal with that.  They are the managers of the system and the economists of the system.  There are those who will say that over the years economists have strangled the health services, that their activity and inactivity in other areas have caused problems for the patients and the general population.  We have to deal with that.  We have to establish the level of growth.  To put that in context, members should think of the number of people who left the country in the period from 2005 to 2014.  In the latter part of that period there was no money in the country to pay for anything.  We must compare like with like.  It is utterly outlandish for any spokesperson for any party, Government or Opposition, to pretend that if we curtailed expenditure on the children's hospital we would somehow solve all our problems.  We would not.  We have a budgetary problem that needs to be addressed.  The current budgetary problem is the annual budget for a Department.  This is one of those Departments.  It is the one Department where outlay is determined by demand.  We either meet the demand or we do not.  I ask that we confine ourselves to those areas, because they are important.  <\/p> <p>  I wish to mention another area that comes to mind.  I will address these points collectively.  I will not go through them individually.  I read them insofar as I could and I had the same difficulty.  I was travelling yesterday and I did not get the chance to read them.  I must say this.<\/p><p>The mental health services are still the Cinderella of the system.  For example, it is impossible to get treatment for a child who is in need of a programme in any service at the current time.  It cannot be done.  People are admitted to the accident and emergency departments of general hospitals and spend the whole day there, but there is nowhere to go.  There are no beds and no permanent programmes.  There are permanent programmes in place to deal with drug addiction and other health matters, but there are no programmes for mental health patients, especially children, who require attention of an ongoing nature as well as treatment and care under supervision outside and inside of a family setting. <\/p><p> In the course of the preparation of the Estimates, I ask the Minister to outline to what extent attention was given to that area.  It needs attention.  I know of a child who was waiting for 12, 14, 18 or 20 hours on a trolley in an adult hospital, having been diagnosed four years ago as being in need of urgent attention and a programme.  The child has failed to get access to a programme from any agency, such as Linn Dara, St. John of God's and so on, for a variety of reasons.  However, it all comes down to one thing, namely, the availability of a necessary framework and structure to accommodate that patient. <\/p><p> Can we be assured that there is something to deal with that within the Estimates this year?  Whatever happened before was not sufficient.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#F00700","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Can we-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#G00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Unlike everybody else, I will not hog the show for the whole day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#G00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Can we get a-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#G00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":690,"content":"<p>By the same token, we all need to be clear about the difference between the current and capital budget.

I accept the point he made about projections and building in a bit of overhead room for contingency planning.  It is a very reasonable and valid point.  It could probably be calculated to a degree actuarially because it is a demand-led service.  Increasing numbers of people are attending accident and emergency departments and so on.  I could speak at length about the changing goalposts.  What the Deputy said is that there should perhaps be a contingency fund, which is a valid and sound point, rather than having a debate every year about overruns.  We will focus relentlessly on that overrun and that has been the priority for the Government and the HSE for the year, with some degree of success.  Others may have different views on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's substantive point was on mental health, an area very close to my heart and for which I have responsibility.  I am quite happy to engage with him on that.  It is difficult to comment on an individual case for obvious reasons and I do not know the background to the case to which he referred.  <\/p> <p>  On the overall issue of accommodation for young people in mental health units in the country, only three counties in Ireland have inpatient beds for young people, namely, Dublin, Cork and Galway.  These figures have not been verified, but this year there were in the region of 300 admissions to inpatient units for young people and teenagers.  <\/p> <p>  I visited Linn Dara in Dublin recently.  What it is doing is particularly impressive.  It has developed a high dependency unit which is working well.  It is also dealing with eating disorders in young people, which are very difficult and challenging for the system because there are young people in acute hospital beds who are medically unwell while also being mentally unwell.  Linn Dara is treating such patients very successfully.  It has had in the region of 110 admissions this year, which is a significant increase on last year.  It has also had a significant increase in the number of discharges, which is very important.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to young people in adult settings.  The numbers have reduced significantly this year, which I am glad to see, in particular in the second half of the year.  This is due to the very good work being done by Linn Dara, which has reduced the reliance on young people being admitted to adult wards.  There will also be a certain cohort of young people admitted to those wards, because of geography and the fact that parents may make a choice that they do not want to go to Dublin, Cork or Galway.  As I have said, a 17 year old may be very strong and, therefore, be better off in an adult ward, rather than a ward for young people, even though the arbitrary age for such a ward is 18 years.  We acknowledge that there are situations where there is no capacity, but they are reducing in frequency thanks to the good work of Linn Dara.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about the consideration given in the preparation of Estimates to mental health for young people, in particular.  There are 70 community CAMHS teams and last year we created a lower level of infrastructure, namely psychology services, in the community.  There are now 130 psychologists and assistant psychologists specifically for young people and a phone line was developed, which was launched last week, to direct people to the appropriate services available.  <\/p> <p>  When we started our research, we found almost 1,100 mental health services were being funded by the HSE.  However, people are not being appropriately referred, and either do not know where services are located or cannot find them.  People are not always in a position to go to a GP, for financial or time reasons, to find out where to access services.  The phone line is a significant development in terms of creating a more appropriate referral pathway.  <\/p> <p>  The waiting lists for the 70 community CAMHS teams was 2,500 in January, but had reduced to 2,000 by October, a reduction of 20%.  I hope there will be a 25% reduction by year end.  That is a direct result of the introduction of psychologist and assistant psychologist services at community level the length and breadth of the country.  The better way forward is early intervention and allowing people to access services sooner because there can be continual escalation of issues if people's mental health is not treated in a timely manner.  I hope the change to waiting lists for community CAMHS teams for young people is sustainable.  As Deputy Durkan knows, our ambition is to treat people in the community and give them the best services there.  In the 1960s, there were 20,000 inpatient psychiatric beds in Ireland, but today there are just over 1,000.  We have moved significantly away from inpatient beds, but there will always be a cohort of people who will require inpatient treatment.  Portrane is being developed and will open in the coming year - the keys will be handed over in the next month or two.  The number of beds in the Central Mental Hospital will increase from 120 to 170, a number of which are for young people.  We will have increased capacity for CAMHS patients and teenagers.  Mental health is very much a consideration in our budgetary planning for the year ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#G01900","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The Chairman will appreciate that the answer is not simple.  There is a continuous challenge to keep a healthy tension between the pull and drag in this.  We cannot have an open door, with money for everything, in a demand-led service.  We have to achieve a scenario such as that driven by the chief executive officer, which is to get people to live within their budget.  That is all part of the drive coming from the political side to not have overruns.  We cannot on one side tell the chief executive officer that he must meet every demand and deliver every service looked for while at the same time telling him he cannot come back to look for more money.<\/p> <p>  On one side there are Government and Opposition Deputies saying there cannot be an overrun and the chief executive is doing his job in telling every health manager under his remit that we need to live within budget and if more is needed at the end of the year, a conversation can be had on the amount.  On the other hand, there is the issue raised by the Chairman, as patients are real people.  They are our mothers, daughters, sisters, brothers, grannies and other loved ones.  If we see them on trolleys etc., we are given a challenging pause for thought.  There is much more to this system than just money and that is where we can bring in Sl&aacute;intecare's move away from the current process.  Any additional euro we are putting into the system, such as with the nursing wage increases, are negotiated with respect to process, change and better productivity, with more efficiencies and an increase in capacity in our health care system.  That can be done and there are initiatives such as the lean sigma programme.  I have referred to Sl&aacute;intecare and the Chairman is well aware of the GP contract.  There is also care of patients with the likes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other chronic illnesses in the community, which is a better way.<\/p> <p>  This is about achieving efficiencies that increase capacity in the system.  There is a healthy tension that will continue and must be maintained.  We cannot just say that we will give everybody what they need but we must continue to monitor the finances.  We are dealing with real people and patients and getting that balance right is not an easy call.  There must be structural and procedural change.  We must look at how we do what we do and find better ways of doing it.

The first is the cross-border scheme and it relates to capacity in our system.  We can keep purchasing the services where there is capacity or we could use that money to invest in infrastructure.  To its credit, the HSE has opened an additional cataract theatre in Nenagh this year, as the Chairman knows.  Waiting lists for that treatment have decreased significantly, and numbers have almost halved.  I do not have the figures off the top of my head but we will have them for next week's quarterly meeting.  The numbers have been significantly reduced because of the additional capacity.  There could be further capacity and we might be better off spending &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million on a new theatre as opposed to spending that money in other ways.  People are waiting for the treatment today, however, and a theatre takes a year to come on stream.  It is about getting that balance right.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned in my opening comments that the number of claims to the State Claims Agency is not rising, which is interesting, and an increase in awards is driving up the figures.  Every day we get up our first priority is patient safety and we must continue to drive that agenda from every aspect of the health service.  It is ultimately the best way to deal with this.

One of the matters raised by consultant representative bodies when coming before the committee is the lack of training posts.  As a result of the loss of experienced medical people to other jurisdictions and the reliance on locums, we now have the potential for a legacy issue as approximately half our non-hospital consultant doctors are not in training posts.  We do not have expertise in the pipeline.  I am particularly concerned about it because we have said so many times that it is not just money that gets people back but rather conditions.  We discussed the children's hospital here last week and we hope it will be the best children's hospital in the world so we can attract the best people to work in it.  I have concerns on how we will staff it with respect to junior doctors and training programmes.  Is there anything the Minister of State can tell us today that will address the matter so that in 2022 we will have the best doctors to treat our children when this much-needed hospital is eventually built, despite many people's best efforts to not have it built?<\/p> <p>  The treatment abroad fund is very helpful to people who are waiting a long time for treatment but there are administrative costs borne here in our regular budget.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is separate.  Without oversimplifying the matter, it is not as simple as sending a patient abroad and we never see him or her again once he or she is fixed up.  There is still an administrative burden here.  The information from abroad must be sown into the system.  It is a good idea but I get alarmed every year at the increase in budget.  It is good because we are treating more people but I would prefer to treat them at home and they should be in our system.  There has been a year-on-year increase over the past number of years so how will we try to reverse this so we can have our people treated in our hospitals by our doctors?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the State Claims Agency, we had the CervicalCheck scandal this year and it had a large cost arising from administration and insurance payouts.<\/p><p>I understand the weight of the claims are predominantly based in the obstetrics and gynaecology area.  While it is great to have a large budget of &euro;1 billion or whatever it is, no money will ever pay for a catastrophic incident at birth.  While it is great to have the money there, my preference would be to have no budget for claims against the State, just as with the NTPF, because we would not have any claims and we would not send people abroad.  As we try to address legacy issues from the recession and the impacts they have had on staff quotas, staff morale and the loss of expertise, how can we get our act together to move out of the recession period and repair our health system to serve people with the benefits of modern medicine, demographic pressures and so on?  How will that be managed in the future?

We will have the quarterly meeting with the committee next week so there may be some more extensive responses available to the Deputy at that stage and that might provide a better opportunity to put questions to the HSE and so on.<\/p> <p>  The consultants and skilled staff issue is an important topic that gets a lot of attention and focus in the Department.  We want to ensure that, as the Deputy said, when we build the children's hospital, we can address that.  I have the same issue in my portfolio in that the new central mental hospital is due to open next year and we want to ensure we have the requisite number of consultants.  The Deputy began by asking about training posts.  That is something I had occasion to look into recently as well and I am glad that there has been a significant increase in my area in funding next year for higher specialist training that is necessary to work at consultant level.  I do not have the numbers to hand but the numbers being trained have increased across the board year on year and more funding will be provided next year again in a number of pinch point areas where there is a deficiency.  We are also looking to the challenge whereby consultants can move on after their training and we are competing with the global market and that is linked to terms and conditions.  The children's hospital and the central mental hospital in Portrane will be two state-of-the-art environments for people to work in and be part of.  That environment is a help.<\/p> <p>  Significant progress has been made on a number of outstanding issues relating to consultants in the past 12 to 18 months but some issues remain that we would all like addressed and we are trying to get to those remaining issues on a piece by piece basis, notwithstanding what we have achieved in negotiations with consultants on their conditions.  The training of advance nurse practitioners, ANPs, across all skill sets is highly important as well.  That is a positive development in the health system that offers enormous potential and, again, they work well in my area.  They call ANPs physician assistants in the US where there is another level below the consultant level but above hospital doctor level.  We have a lot of work to do in Sl&aacute;intecare to look at identifying the skill set and the skill match.  A great deal of work is being looked at in the framework in order that we can meet those demands but that is an ongoing challenge.<\/p> <p>   I concur with the Deputy on the cross-border scheme.  I would prefer if we had the capacity here to treat our own patients but under EU law every EU citizen has a right to travel for healthcare if they so wish, if the treatment they need is not available in their area and we have obligations in that regard.  It works both ways.  I recall a meeting with the head of the police in Dubai.  They are anxious to work with us again as they have been availing of coronary care in Ireland.  Any members of the Dubai police force who require coronary care and heart procedures are sent to Ireland.  That is obviously not covered by the EU directive because the United Arab Emirates is not in the EU and they are using private hospitals so they are not causing a blockage.  People will always travel for healthcare.  I would prefer us to have increased capacity but the difficulty is that the money being spent on that scheme could build additional capacity but that lifeline cannot be cut off.  It would be illegal to do so.  People have to have the right to migrate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#J00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I am not suggesting we stop that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#J00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

I refer to the issue of recruitment embargoes or freezes or to the practice of only employing staff within available resources or budget allocations.  It can be counter-intuitive that by limiting staff or freezing recruitment, money is saved.  Of course money is saved in one budgetary silo but patients generally do not go away and, therefore, if they are not getting service, they will either get it elsewhere in the emergency department or they will deteriorate and require more complex treatment when they eventually get treatment.  If there is a limitation on staffing levels, that does not necessarily mean money is being saved.  Money may just be transferred to a different budget that providers for more urgent or complex treatment instead.  We have been looking at workforce planning in recent months and we have had many different groups before the committee.  The consistent message from all of them is that failing to recruit or staff to an appropriate level is costing additional money and no money is being saved.

If we continue to keep hiring and throwing more money at the problem, we will not fix the healthcare system and I am not suggesting the Chairman is proposing we do that.  The other extreme is not to hire any more staff so there is a balance to be struck between those two positions.  I spoke earlier about the constant tension between the desire to continue to recruit and looking at what we have done.  It is about reorganising healthcare delivery and the budgets.  We are here as politicians and one day we are giving out about an overrun and the next, we will give out that the service is not there and so on.  How do we fix that?  It is about structural reform.  The regional integrated care organisations, RICOs, are an important development as opposed to the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, because it was maddening to see people in the community considered not to be part of the problem if they were on a trolley or on a hospital bed for an extra week.  That did not bother the people in the community who were in charge of home help in the slightest because if one person was in the hospital, that was one less person for them to take care of.  That siloing we did in healthcare was not helpful with budgeting.  We can continue with additional recruitment in acute healthcare but we could look at more proactive ways and means of avoiding admissions to acute healthcare.  Perhaps there should be more recruitment for community healthcare.  Recruitment in and of itself is a solution but it is not the solution to everything.  Putting a cap on it is about getting people to work within the budget they have so they cannot have an open-ended budget.

How can the waiting lists be dealt with?  It is not rocket science.  If we have a waiting list of 1,000, we should be able to figure out how long it will take to deal with it.  This is where the planning comes in.  Where are the deficiencies that prevent us dealing with that waiting list now?  If we cannot deal with that waiting list within a specified period, we should know the specified period within which it should be dealt with and we can then do the budget again.  If we cannot do both and identify exactly what is required, the waiting lists will go on forever.  If a waiting list is half a mile long this year, it will be two miles long next year because we will have not shortened it.  The only way to deal with that is to attack it from all ends together.  If that means reverting to the treatment purchase scheme or the private sector, we need to deal with it.  There is no good talking about it.<\/p> <p>  I recently came across a case where the patient was due to come back in two or three years because the condition was supposedly controllable or containable.  It was not and I was proved right.  If we are telling patients things like that, we are reducing public confidence in the system.  I do not attribute blame to anybody in particular, but we all need to recognise it.  It is no good talking around the subject; we need to deal with the subject.<\/p> <p>  Just as in the PC sum to deal with unforeseen issues that come up during the year that we have to deal with - we have to deal with emergencies anyway - we should also draw up a plan to tackle the logjams.  It is a farce to have people hanging around in emergency departments all day long and the following day.  We have older people sitting on trolleys for two or three days.  We should not be dealing with that at all.  It is demoralising.  Why do we not have a bed to put them into?<\/p> <p>  Earlier today we had a discussion with representatives from F&oacute;rsa on step-down beds.  There are step-down beds for women in St. Brigid's Hospital in Crooksling and the Government is closing the place on the basis that the facilities there are old.  They are not old; all they need is ongoing maintenance.  Such facilities could come on-stream to relieve the pressure we are now facing.<\/p> <p>  We need to look again at how we are doing it.  If we put one doctor into a hospital emergency department and leave him there for three or four days, I guarantee that he will be out the door and down the road after a week.  It is not possible for one person to deal with full weight of the demand at any given time.  We need a relief system and we must be prepared to recognise that that will arise.<\/p> <p>  People will claim that I am speaking like an Opposition Member.  I am speaking as I have always spoken, as a member of any health committee or body; I have been on a few of them over the years.  There is no difficulty dealing with the political element, which means nothing in terms of a contribution to alleviating the problems that now assail the health services.  To lift that siege, we need to be able to reassure people with a plan for reducing waiting lists in the coming year.<\/p> <p>  The IFAC needs to know that as well.  I do not propose to take on the council because I know where we went in the past.  However, it needs to take into account those areas of current expenditure where we need to deal with the size of the problem as it arises.  The result is we do not do anything about it in which case the service becomes run down.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is the third most expensive of the OECD countries and 27th in public satisfaction ratings.  There is something wrong there.  I do not know what the problem is.  I am not an expert in these issues.  I do not need to be an expert, nor does anybody else.  However, somebody somehow and somewhere needs to say, \"Okay, we're going to merge these two areas.  We are going to deal with them.  We are going to identify the contributory causes.\"  We are continuously told about the Dutch and Swedish models.  They do not work, for God's sake; they have the same problems.<\/p> <p>  It all comes back to identifying the scale of the issue in a service that cannot be postponed forever.  If it was a road building project, it could be postponed, but when somebody's health is at issue, it cannot be postponed.  Doing nothing scares the public and demoralises those involved in the service.  It avoids facing the decision that has to be taken eventually to deal with the patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2019120400002#K00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.

In 2020, we will to publish an access plan for unscheduled care looking at how we can deal with this issue.<\/p> <p>  Talking about the politics of it and politicians, a few months ago a lady approached me.  She said she had been out of work for a year and a half because of an injured shoulder and was now fit to go back to work.  She needed to be signed back on by her consultant.  She rang the consultant's office to find out if she could see him.  He told her he would see her in 2021.  She told me she did not want to draw disability allowance for the next 18 months or two years, while waiting to see a consultant for five minutes to sign her back to work.  She asked if I, as a Minister of State, could so anything for her.<\/p> <p>  I wrote to the consultant and asked if there was any possibility he could see this lady for five minutes.  He wrote back to me saying that he would not discuss any of his patients with me and suggested it was more in my line, as a Minister of State, to provide more money.

One is to illustrate the Deputy's point about the politics of it.  More important, it is to look at how we fix the structure.<\/p> <p>  In one particular discipline in the south of the country, I have sought information from the HSE through the Secretary General of my Department on the time each of the consultants in this discipline is giving to private and public practice.  There are enormous anomalies in the one I am looking at.  These consultants were contracted by the State and are supposed to be spending a certain amount of their time delivering to the public.  These are issues affecting waiting lists because they are all on the public side.  Obviously, on the private side there is no waiting list and a patient can be rushed through and there are incentives for people.

I am an Irish citizen.  It is not a choice or a decision I made; it is simply who I am.  I have not held a British passport or claimed British citizenship and yet I have found myself in an unprecedented situation.  In 2015 when I married my American husband Jake, I discovered that through the UK Government&rsquo;s failure to give domestic legal effect to the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, my lifelong Irish identity is evidently considered secondary to an unclaimed British identity.  This additional and entirely imposed citizenship deprives me of my rights as an Irish citizen and an EU citizen.<\/p> <p>  I am here to discuss the 14 October 2019 ruling by the Upper Tribunal which overturned a previous ruling that I am an Irish citizen only, who has only ever been such.  I will be covering three themes today, namely, the implications of this ruling for citizenship rights in Northern Ireland; the incompatibility of this ruling with the Good Friday Agreement; and what actions the British and Irish Governments could be taking. <\/p> <p>  The implications of this ruling for citizenship rights in Northern Ireland are as follows.  On 14 October the Upper Tribunal ruled that the people of Northern Ireland remain British citizens even if they identify as Irish.  The Home Office, after years of appeals, has now successfully argued that Northern Ireland citizens have no right to choose their nationality, regardless of the birthright provisions outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.  Rather, they are permitted to identify on a personal level as Irish, yet are in fact British at birth.  This sets a dangerous precedent, reducing an integral right to choose one&rsquo;s own national identity - in this case, to identify as and be accepted as Irish - into a right to merely feel Irish.<\/p> <p>  The 14 October ruling was primarily based on three grounds, namely, that the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement do not include the ability to choose one&rsquo;s citizenship; that the absence of Article 1(iv) from the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was entirely deliberate; and that even if this provision was to amount to a right to choose one&rsquo;s own citizenship, this right is not present in domestic UK law, therefore we cannot rely on it.<\/p> <p>  The tribunal stated that under the UK's dualist system the Good Friday Agreement and annexed British-Irish Agreement are not binding in domestic law save insofar as its provisions have been incorporated into domestic law through the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  The tribunal agreed with the Secretary of State for the Home Department that the British Nationality Act 1981 is compatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  Both the Secretary of State and tribunal interpret the agreement as a right to identify as Irish or British or both, not a right to choose citizenship.  The tribunal took no issue with the process of renunciation of British citizenship, a process that the Home Office  requested that I undertake, which requires a declaration that an individual is in fact a British citizen.  It also requires that a person proves that he or she is British, pay &pound;372 to do so, gives up his or her freedom of movement for six months and afterwards he or she can be exposed to further immigration controls.<\/p> <p>  As a result of this ruling only one of the three categories of citizenship that are provided for under the Good Friday Agreement is respected.  Ireland amended its nationality laws after the 1998 referendum, moving Irish citizenship away from an automatic conferral to that of an entitlement.  As a result of Ireland taking the appropriate legislative steps, and while the UK has resisted legislation in this area, only those who identify solely as British have their birthright under the Good Friday Agreement upheld.  There is no conferral of Irish citizenship on those who do not wish to hold it.  However, those of us who identify solely as Irish must first accept that they we are British, renounce being British, and go through a lengthy, costly and often traumatic process in order to be accepted solely as Irish.  Dual nationals in Northern Ireland also have rights restrictions in this way.  This undoubtedly breaches the principles of parity of esteem and equality under the Good Friday Agreement.  There cannot, nor should not, be preferential treatment for one community but an equal opportunity to make a free choice without differential or detrimental treatment.<\/p> <p>  The ruling also raises an important question over citizenship in the event of reunification of this island.  The tribunal and the Secretary of State rely entirely on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional position within the United Kingdom to assert British citizenship.  If this decision is allowed to stand it will set a precedent that may affect those wishing to hold British citizenship in a united Ireland, as this region would no longer be a part of the United Kingdom.  The tribunal claims citizenship flows from the British Nationality Act 1981 and not from the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  A further ramification on citizenship from this ruling is that it cements a British first, Irish second policy in the United Kingdom.  Those of us who identify solely as Irish are considered British while in the UK.  This creates two tiers of Irish citizens, those who were born in the South, who are resident in the United Kingdom, who can access and retain their full EU rights and entitlements, and those of us born in the North, who cannot.<\/p> <p>  The second theme is compatibility with the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not believe that the 14 October ruling is compatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  Not only does this ruling create a distinction between identity and citizenship under the agreement but it also negatively impacts a number of convention rights such as Article 8, the right to private life, and Article 14, freedom from discrimination.  Article 1 of the Good Friday Agreement recognises the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as British or Irish or both, as they so choose and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments.  This can be read from the text constituting a duty on both states to accept the people of Northern Ireland as British or Irish or both, as they so choose.  The choice of identity is limited to the same categories as citizenship, and rights to hold both British and Irish citizenship is in light of many states not permitting dual citizenship.<\/p> <p>  The view that the Belfast Agreement is in fact a constitutional document is now widely accepted.  In determining whether, and to what extent, the UK requires a codified constitution, the fact that Northern Ireland is regarded as already having one is seen as a matter for consideration.<\/p> <p>  It is recognised that there exists a hierarchy of rights wherein constitutional rights should be and are afforded greater respect than ordinary statute.  They form part of a higher law.  Regardless of British citizenship law the Home Office accepted Northern Ireland-born persons as solely Irish until 2012.  Imposing citizenship in this way is a relatively new policy and represents a departure from the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p> Through this process I have had to outline every moment in my life that my Irish identity has been evident in order to prove to the courts that I am Irish, including things as mundane as the fact that I did Irish dancing when I was a child.  I have had to put that into a written court statement as proof that I am Irish.<\/p><p> A key objective of the peace talks was to establish equality between the two main communities and to establish a shared society based on the principles of parity of esteem and mutual respect.  Yet I have witnessed at first hand the negative impact and emotional trauma caused by expecting Irish citizens to declare themselves as British in order to access their rights.  We have met families that have lost years in courts, fighting against this conferral; families that cried whilst renouncing British citizenship; and families that simply moved away from their homes, families and livelihood.  No one should be forced to adopt or renounce a citizenship he or she has never held in order to access rights which were meant to be granted at birth, but that is what is happening today in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> I would like to move on to what actions, if any, the British and Irish Governments could or should take in response to this ruling.  It has been encouraging to many that the Irish Government has become more vocal on this issue since the ruling on 14 October, and I am sure there will be those who will take solace in this committee hearing today.  However, the denial of rights continues and has a real-time effect on people across Northern Ireland.  Last week I met with another family renouncing British citizenship.  The week before that, I met another family simply leaving the country to access their rights.  An urgent and effective response is required to deal with this.<\/p><p> Mrs. Theresa May pledged a review into these issues in February of this year, but unfortunately this review was not released before she departed.  There is speculation that a review exists, but we have no timeline, no terms of reference, and no indication that it will ever be released.  I believe there is a little bit of a reliance on the outcome of this review, and I do not think it will ever see the light of day, to be honest.<\/p><p> We have been informed that counsel on behalf of the Home Office is taking direct orders from the Secretary of State for the Home Department in our case, and I believe this contradicts the British Government&rsquo;s claim that it is seeking a resolution here.  I have seen no indication of any political will or appetite to find a solution that is in line with the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement in all of my correspondence with British officials.  I have seen statements made that the British Government cannot be held to the spirit of a treaty, that it is the British Government&rsquo;s view that an international agreement such as the Belfast Good Friday Agreement cannot supersede domestic legislation and that there is nothing in the Belfast Agreement to prevent the automatic conferral of British citizenship.  On 14 October, when the ruling came in, the Home Office released a statement that it was pleased with the outcome of that ruling.  All these statements, combined with the resources and time invested into pursuing this case against us over the past four years, demonstrates that the British Government is not committed to the Good Friday Agreement, or to finding a resolution in line with the birthright provisions.<\/p><p> It is noted that there is no official dispute mechanism within the Good Friday Agreement, nevertheless there remains a responsibility on the Irish Government as a co-guarantor to uphold and protect the agreement in all its parts.  It is clear that an amendment to the British Nationality Act 1981 is necessary, and a number of parties in Northern Ireland support this, including Alliance, Sinn F&eacute;in, and the SDLP.<\/p><p> There is also, in light of Brexit, a restriction on Northern Ireland born Irish citizens accessing the EU settlement scheme, which the Irish Government could pursue.  Increasingly, those of us in the North, in the face of a British Government abdicating its responsibilities, are looking towards Dublin to safeguard our rights.  If the British Government can arbitrarily disregard rights guaranteed to the people of Northern Ireland under an internationally binding peace treaty, what safeguards are in place to prevent further diminution of rights?

I would like to make clear that I am speaking today in a personal capacity only.  I am participating in the University and College Union, UCU, strike action in my university, so I am speaking as an Irish citizen living and working in the North.  I would like to commend Emma and Jake on their courage and the stand that they have made on this issue.  They speak for many people, and as so often is the case in relation to matters of human rights and equality, all of us depend on courageous civic leadership, and I would like to commend Emma and Jake on the work they have undertaken on this issue.<\/p> <p>  What we are talking about today is very simple.  It is an implementation gap in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, and there are a number of implementation gaps.  Let us be clear.  The implementation gaps that we are talking about harm everyone in Northern Ireland.  I want to concentrate today on two themes.  First, I want to say something about the wider context in terms of the agreement, and second, I want to say something about the birthright guarantee under the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  First, in terms of context, it is important to frame the conversation today in relation to a wider implementation gap that is the cause of instability in the North at the moment.  Keep in mind that a number of reasonable expectations from the Good Friday Agreement have not yet as yet been delivered.  There is no Bill of rights for the North, and as I note in my written opening statement, the Human Rights Commission in its advice in 2008 addressed this question in its proposals.  There is no charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement contains a right to self-determination, linked to the principle of consent, and many people on this island are increasingly worried about the lack of adequate preparation and planning when the day arrives for those referendums to take place.  There is no Irish language Act in the North.  People await the referendum to be held on voting rights in presidential elections which will have huge significance for Irish citizens everywhere.<\/p> <p>  In relation to Brexit, there are a multitude of issue and problems, but we have the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  Will the guarantees that are there be effectively implemented in British domestic law, policy and practice?  What we are hearing this morning, and what we know is, that 21 years after the Good Friday Agreement, many of the guarantees there are still not reflected in domestic law, policy and practice in the UK.  Also in relation to Brexit, a rather neglected issue is whether Northern Ireland will have a voice in the European Parliament in a post-Brexit scenario.<\/p> <p>  I list these as simply illustrative of a number of examples of ongoing problems in relation to lack of implementation, and in relation to the human rights and equality crisis in the North.  As the committee is aware, there is a lot of focus at the moment on the restoration of power sharing and on the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly and getting that up and running.  I would like to underline and make something clear to the committee all this morning.  Think back on all the issues that I have just listed.  Many of those, if not all of them, are within the gift of both Governments to deliver, so it is vital that both the British state and Irish State work to advance these issues as a matter of urgency.  Speaking personally, one of the most troubling and one of the dangerous narratives that has taken hold across these islands at the moment is that the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly will solve all the problems of the North.  That is just not true.<\/p> <p>  The second theme is the right to be identified as British or Irish, or both, as we have already heard so eloquently from Emma.  We are talking about a foundational constitutional commitment flowing from the Good Friday Agreement.  We know, as a matter of fact, that it is not properly implemented in British domestic law, policy and practice but it is even more disturbing than that, as we have already heard.  There is no genuine grasp evident in the British system of the significance of this birthright guarantee.<\/p><p>In fact, I would press that a bit further with the committee today.  There does not seem to be any genuine grasp of the significance of the Good Friday Agreement itself for all the people of this island, and there does not seem to be any genuine grasp of the impact of the failure to comply with the birthright guarantee on respect for human rights and human dignity of all those affected.  Very troubling indeed, I think, is the British Government's rationale for the approach that it is adopting.  The British Government appears not to be saying that this is an implementation failure.  The British Government is saying that its interpretation is right, and I think what is worrying about the Upper Tribunal decision is that it appears to go along with that rationale.  If one adopts that approach, there is not a problem to remedy.  That is why I think the Irish Government has been absolutely right to point out that this is a misreading of the Good Friday Agreement - in other words, the British Government is simply wrong in its approach to the agreement.  That is not the first time that has happened, and I suspect it will not be the last time.  There is an implementation failure.  It is an implementation failure that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, and for reasons that we have heard.<\/p><p> We are facing, I think, an implementation crisis, and while much of the narrative often falls on the absence of power sharing and the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, we should keep in mind this morning that many of these issues we are talking about, and the issue we are talking about specifically today, rests with both Governments to take forward as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government must move to resolve this implementation failure, and bring law, policy, and practice into line with the agreement.  What it is raising is something that has been troubling constitutional lawyers and those with an interest in the agreement for some time, and that is the question that within the UK system, there is inadequate political and judicial acknowledgement of the constitutional significance of the Good Friday Agreement for this island and for these islands.  Something constitutionally significant happened in 1998, and that needs to be more fully recognised in the British legal and political systems.<\/p><p> I am increasingly worried about the status accorded to the agreement in the UK system by politicians and judges, and keep in mind the context that we are thinking about today.  The context is Brexit, and conversations about another agreement - a withdrawal agreement and protocol and in a number of years' time many people do not want to watch yet another agreement not properly implemented, so it is absolutely vital that this is faced by both Governments as a matter of urgency, as a matter of demonstrating respect for the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p> This is not about creating winners and losers.  It is really rather simple.  More than 21 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, many of us are seeking to ensure that agreement is implemented in law, policy, and practice.  There are no winners and losers here.  The winners will be everyone who lives in Northern Ireland.  This is about the British and the Irish Governments working to create a level playing field in the North, so that the institutions and the values of the Good Friday Agreement might flourish in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":744,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Professor Harvey.

As the committee may know, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, is a Belfast-based independent human rights organisation.  We co-convene the Equality Coalition with UNISON, and we are the NGO partner in BrexitLawNI, a joint project with the law schools of Queens and Ulster Universities.  I run the immigration project at CAJ which focuses on the impact of Brexit on the immigration regime, and through this, rights and equality in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We are all familiar with the background of the DeSouza case.  In refusing an immigration application the Home Office revealed its policy of treating all persons born in Northern Ireland as automatically British, stating that they can become solely Irish only through the process of renouncing that British citizenship for the price of &pound;372.  The reason for this policy is that most dual British and EU nationals are excluded from exercising European Economic Area, EEA, family reunion rights, so this policy comes down to preventing people from bringing family to the UK.  This policy is not compliant with the Good Friday Agreement, which recognises the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be recognised as British, or Irish, or both, and this is a treaty-based duty on both states.<\/p> <p>  When this issue was raised, instead of taking action to ensure compliance with the Good Friday Agreement, the UK Government instead pursued litigation in which it defended its choice to ignore its obligations under the agreement.  A review into the matter, promised by former Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, had no terms of reference or timeframe, and has never come to light, and the UK Government continues to implement this policy.  This will have a wide impact, particularly in the face of Brexit.  The policy means that Northern Ireland born Irish citizens will be among the only EU citizens in UK jurisdiction who are excluded from the EU settlement scheme, which is the domestic mechanism allowing EU citizens to retain legally enforceable EU rights under the citizens rights provisions of the withdrawal agreement.  This also creates tiers of Irish citizenship, where an Irish citizen who is born in the Republic or even elsewhere, can apply to the scheme, but an Irish person born in Northern Ireland cannot.  Take the example of neighbours born in Donegal and Derry, respectively, living in the UK.  Both are Irish citizens, but both will have totally different rights protections post-Brexit.  The policy makes a mockery of the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, undermining trust in the peace agreement and causing tension among communities.  Emma and Jake were successful in challenging the Home Office decision at the First-tier Tribunal.  The Home Office chose to appeal this to the Upper Tribunal, and in the recent decision the Upper Tribunal overturned the First-tier Tribunal decision upholding the original Home Office decision.<\/p> <p>  In its appeal, the UK Government advocated a reinterpretation of the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, which is not in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement as a treaty.  The UK, downplaying the duty on both states to accept Northern Ireland born persons as Irish, or British, or both, instead sought to reinvent the provision as one separating the concept of identity from the legal bond of citizenship.  The UK Government argued that the provision of dual nationality and the option of renouncing British citizenship equate to compliance with the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and duality approach means that on signing the British-Irish Agreement, the UK should have then legislated to bring its nationality law in line with the Good Friday Agreement's citizenship provisions.  The UK failed to do this, resulting in the citizenship provisions not being directly enforceable in the domestic courts.  Emma and Jake face an uphill battle overcoming this through UK courts, and the process of litigation also carries huge personal and financial burdens for both of them.<\/p> <p>  The need for action beyond the courts is becoming increasingly clear.  DeSouza has highlighted the need for urgent legislative reform of the British Nationality Act to give effect to the Good Friday Agreement.  The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, NIHRC, has recommended that the British Nationality Act is amended to reflect the birthright provisions, and I believe it has commissioned a report on this which should be published soon.<\/p><p> In the meantime, the Home Office could amend its policy to allow for Northern Irish-born Irish citizens to assert their right to Irish citizenship only, in line with the Good Friday Agreement.  We know it can do this because this was its policy prior to 2012.  The Northern Irish Human Rights Commission has also recommended that a right to be British or Irish, or both, is enshrined as a right in the Good Friday Agreement-mandated Northern Irish Bill of rights, which the UK is yet to discharge its duties and legislate for.

I am also glad to see that our Taoiseach has correctly indicated that the British Government's approach is a misreading of the agreement.<\/p> <p>  It seems that the heart of this case is about preventing the automatic conferral of British citizenship.  One of the suggestions made was to amend the British Nationality Act to enable this.  Could the witnesses describe how that would work in practice?  Should it be that in order to avoid statelessness a child born in Belfast is automatically given British and Irish citizenship, and would simply be able to say later on that he or she is solely Irish without needing to pay and formally renounce British citizenship?  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  If the issue is having citizenship at any point, how would citizenship be dealt with at birth?

Under Ireland's nationality laws, if another entitlement to citizenship exists, then Irish citizenship is an entitlement - it is not automatically conferred.  In terms of statelessness in Northern Ireland, there would be entitlement to Irish and British citizenship, therefore one cannot be rendered stateless if one has an entitlement to both of those.  In terms of how that would be enacted through legislation, I am awaiting the outcome of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's report, which I believe addresses a lot of these issues and how one could amend the legislation.  There are legal solutions there, and one can look at Ireland's legislation as an example of that, and at international law and how it operates with statelessness.  My understanding is that under international law if an entitlement to citizenship exists, then one cannot be rendered stateless.  It has to be a personal choice for each individual to make as to whether they want to be Irish or British or both.

In addition to the issue of choice, British or Irish or both, the question of a detriment arising around that choice will need to be addressed.  Work is being done on the notion that we may need to move into a system that recognises the unique circumstances of the North, whereby we move to a system which looks very like equality of citizenship in relation to British and Irish citizens.  That is why, in the earlier intervention, I tried to underline that the agreement is not only quite good at talking very specifically about issues of nationality and identity, but also about wrapping those around a broader framework about the human rights of everyone in the North.  That is why the implementation gap on issues such as the Bill of rights, the charter for the island, leaves us devoid of a comprehensive rights and equality-based framework in the North.

The UN convention on statelessness states that one can only be rendered stateless if one does not have citizenship by operation of the law.  If, like Ms DeSouza said, there is an entitlement to two different citizenships, then one would not be stateless and we are waiting to see a significant body of work on this that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has done which will hopefully be published quite soon.

She said that the absence of Article 1(iv) of the Good Friday Agreement from the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was entirely deliberate.  I would like to tease that out a little.

That is not entirely exclusive to people living in the Six Counties, and I am sure there are some of them who live in this jurisdiction as well.

I have tried to frame my contribution today around an implementation gap that rests with the British and the Irish Governments as co-guarantors of that agreement.  There is a bigger problem that the constitutional significance of the Good Friday Agreement for this island has not made its way fully and effectively into the British constitutional legal system, be it politically, or legally as well.  That is something we need to think about remedying in the time ahead.<\/p><p> We are in a context where we are talking about a Brexit conversation as well and where we do not want to be in a situation in a number of years time where we cannot do anything if some of the guarantees that are being given at the moment are not being realised in practice.  That needs urgent work and legal reform within the British system, but it is an endemic problem.  The reason for framing it in relation to the agreement is that we are on a pathway towards referendums on constitutional change on the island, and I mentioned this at the start.  I refer to the right to self-determination.  When people talk about human rights in the agreement they tend to skip over this one, but it is an important one.  It is in the agreement and it is linked to the principle consent, and there is a conversation on the island about planning and preparing, in a prudential way, for those referendums that are coming.  Nobody wants the Brexit mess on this island.  It is about planning and preparing, and central to the planning and preparing is the framework of the Good Friday Agreement, and the values that are there, and the birthright guarantee is crystal clear on this.  Those guarantees are intended to persist into the future, and those are guarantees for British citizens in the future.  Those are guarantees in relation to unionists and loyalists in the future, that rights will be respected, and it is absolutely vital that we have that Good Friday Agreement framework.  That is why when one sees the Good Friday Agreement undermined in the way it is in the here and now, that should give us all pause for thought about the future, and it has been why there is bit of frustration around these debates.<\/p><p> I tried to underline at the start that this is not about winners and losers.  Emma's and Jake's courageous stand around the birthright guarantee will benefit everyone who is protected by that guarantee, now and into the future, wherever the future may take us, and so many arguments about the Good Friday Agreement are on that basis.  The implementation gap harms everyone in the North, and that is why it needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> Just to repeat myself, which I am prone to do, it is about both Governments creating a level playing field so that the Good Friday Agreement, and its institutions and values, might find the space to breathe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#F01500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey.

For me, that argument being made by the Home Office and the British Government signifies an almost rewriting of that provision.  There is no evidence to support that submission either.  There are no statements from 1998.  There is no evidence supporting the current view that it was deliberate, that this was to be left out in 1998.  If anything, we have seen people like Jonathan Powell state that this has been overlooked and it is a mistake that it has not made it into legislation.<\/p> <p>  First, it is quite concerning that it is taking that path.  It is a minimising of the right.  It is watering it down from a right to choose ones nationality and hold Irish or British citizenship, or both, to a right to feel Irish or British, or both, and I do not think this is what was intended in 1998.<\/p> <p>  With regard to British citizens in the event of a unification, there is a real issue here because only Britain can decide who is or is not a British citizen, and if the Home Office is successful in watering down the birthright provisions to a right to just feel Irish or British, or both - that we do not have citizenship stemming through that - then it raises the question of what would happen to British citizens in the event of a united Ireland, and what could Ireland do because it cannot grant British citizenship to British citizens.  One has a situation where potentially in one to two generations British citizenship could become at risk for those in Northern Ireland who want to hold it.<\/p> <p>  A point I would like to highlight is that this situation that I am in does not just affect people who only identify as Irish.  I have met many families who are unionist and who have renounced British citizenship in order to access their rights, and that is very difficult for them to do because they are having to give up their identity in order to access rights.  There are plenty of people in the North who are very happy and content to hold British and Irish citizenship, and they are in a situation where they have to choose one or the other to access their rights, and it basically puts everyone in a very difficult position where their identity is being questioned by the Government.

I think it described it as clearly being fully aligned with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, so it comes back to this idea that there is no will here.  There is no acceptance from the British Government that there may have been something that was overlooked, that there may have been something that was not properly enacted.  It is firmly standing behind the argument that its position is right, that the British Nationality Act is compliant with the Good Friday Agreement.  As Ms DeSouza touched on, to do this it has essentially reread the citizenship provisions.  What it is doing is separating the identity and the citizenship into two separate parts, which we do not have a lot of information on.

A person has the right to identify and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, and accordingly, Irish and British citizenship are protected.

I had a look at the decision of the Upper Tribunal and parts of it are curious, other parts indicate, as Professor Harvey said, that there has not been full implementation.  If one looks at the Good Friday Agreement, there are two agreements to it - there is the multi-party agreement, and there is the agreement between the two Governments.  It is expressly provided in it, that persons are entitled to identify themselves, and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.  Clearly the two Governments agreed to that and the parties endorsed that agreement.  I wish to ask Professor Harvey, in terms of the breach of an international treaty - I know the argument is it has not been implemented into British domestic law - if that provision has not been implemented into British law, what is the remedy there for Ms DeSouza in the first instance?  Is it an obligation that rests on the other party to the agreement, the Irish Government, to try to invoke it, and if so, where does it go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#H01900","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":791,"content":"<p>That is a great question.  It is one of the challenges as we know with the Good Friday Agreement, the multi-party agreement and the bilateral international treaty.  To cut a very long story short, as a matter of international law there is very little that the Irish Government can do to remedy this situation.  Dispute resolution is one of the weaknesses in the British-Irish Agreement, and it is one of the things I mentioned earlier.  The lesson has been learned in relation to the discussions around the withdrawal agreement and the protocol, that there are things that can be done, so it is a big problem.  As the Deputy will know, the British constitutional legal system is still very much anchored around this concept of parliamentary supremacy.  It is a dualist legal system, which means that unless and until an international legal text is translated into the domestic legal system - it is more complicated than that but that is a summary - then effectively for individuals there is very little they can do to enforce those rights.<\/p> <p>  What we have here is a concrete example of where a binding international bilateral treaty has not been effectively implemented in domestic law, policy, and practice in the UK.  It is one of the big problems with the UK system, that one can reach what one thinks is a political agreement.  One can even agree an international treaty with the UK, and there are obligations around good faith interpretation, but if that international agreement does not have an effective system for resolving disputes, then individuals are very reliant on what happens in domestic law, policy and practice.<\/p> <p>  For me and for many people, as we said today, the problem here is an implementation gap.  It has not been reflected, but it is not the only concept from the agreement that is not reflected in British domestic law, policy and practice.  One problem that I have, among many, at the moment is that on issues such as parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality of treatment between British and Irish citizens, as well as some of the human rights and equality issues I have mentioned, there is a yawning implementation gap.  Until that is addressed effectively one is not going to get any form of sustainable power-sharing operating in the North, because that level playing field will not be there.  One cannot have a situation where one has a bits and pieces approach to implementing the agreement.

Other people have spent years in court doing the same thing and trying to fight for their rights.  People are in a really desperate position now in the North where they saw this ruling in October and they feel like they are being left behind, that their rights are not being respected and that they are not being upheld.

In relation to the Good Friday Agreement, recall that the protocol includes Article 2.  It includes a reference to no diminution in relation to rights and equality, and specifically references a part of the Good Friday Agreement in the protocol, so it is very likely in the future that the Good Friday Agreement will find itself being discussed within that architecture.  A second aspect to keep in mind is that we need to be mindful that, with any agreement that involves the UK Government, whatever guarantees are there need to find their way fully and effectively into British law, policy, and practice.  Bear in mind the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not want to leave the EU, but if Brexit happens, it is vital to ensure that the guarantees that are in the withdrawal agreement, for example, in relation to rights and equality, are fully reflected in that Bill as it goes through Parliament.  To repeat myself, we do not want to end up in a situation here where the committee is hearing evidence in the years ahead from individuals affected, whose rights have been infringed, but there is no way for them to do anything about it.  To be fair, some of the lessons that have emerged from the agreement have been learned in the context of those negotiations between the EU and UK in relation to the enforceability dispute resolution and adjudication of the guarantees that are given there.  They are not ideal, but it is clear that there are lessons that have been learned, but it will need to be watched carefully in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":814,"content":"<p>Thank you Professor Harvey.

We did not see that reflected in the withdrawal agreement, and what we have in the withdrawal agreement is part two which outlined citizens rights, so it is things like workers' rights, residents' rights, and the rights to family reunion.  There is a commitment that those rights will be protected for life, but already Northern Irish born Irish citizens are excluded from those because the only way of accessing them is the EU settlement scheme, and the only way of applying to the EU settlement scheme is to not be considered a dual national, so we have come full circle in terms of protections under the withdrawal agreement.

There has been a broad range of fairly extensive legal questions, understandably given the legal complexities of this case and the challenge, so I will not rehearse all of those.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a couple of observations.  I suppose the core political component of this is that there should not be a dispute around this and that a dispute mechanism should not be sought, because of the nature of the agreement.  For all of us, this may have been disputed beforehand but ultimately it was agreed.  The British Government were a co-guarantor and a co-signatory to the agreement, and the agreement is explicitly clear in terms of the right not just to identify but also to be accepted as Irish, as British, or as both.<\/p> <p>  The other challenge and the other consideration for us in the Oireachtas is how this stance by the British Government does not just run up very roughly against the Good Friday Agreement but also runs up against Article 2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in terms of our rights to be part of the Irish nation.  There is a consideration for us, and Deputy Breathnach makes a very valid suggestion in terms of that cross-party motion.  There is one on the Seanad Order Paper, which the Deputy's colleagues and others have signed, so maybe it is something that both Houses can pursue in equal measure going forward.<\/p> <p>  I am also encouraged that the T&aacute;naiste has finally agreed to meet Ms DeSouza later this month, with me and a number of colleagues from the North as well.  One of the things that we could do, if it is in order, is to suggest that this committee write to the British Secretary of State seeking an update on the review, because my experience, along with our visitors' experience, is that it has been like trying to grab smoke.  I am not suggesting that we will have any additional success in that regard, but it is worth actioning off the back of today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  The question I always like to ask, and it has sort of been covered already, is what we can do, what pressure we can bring to bear on the Irish Government.  The Irish Government, to be fair to it, has said all of the right things in terms of upholding Ms DeSouza's rights, and that it considers her to be an Irish citizen, which is very good of it 21 years after the Good Friday Agreement.  Nevertheless, it is important that that is said.  Perhaps the witnesses could expand on what they have said to colleagues already on the challenges and the work for us both as members of this committee and as individual Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#L01600","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":855,"content":"<p>The Senator has not asked a particular question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#L01700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":856,"content":"<p>Are there other avenues open to the Irish Government outside of the dispute mechanism that we know?

What more could the Irish Government do?  Professor Harvey referenced the referendum on voting rights, which it is hoped will be upcoming.  However, while the Irish Government keeps telling us consistently that we are Irish citizens, there are no tangible actions in terms of enfranchising that citizenship.  I am curious whether, within the confines of the Good Friday Agreement and the Constitution, there are tangible actions that the Irish Government could take in the here and now and over the short to medium term that would tangibly enfranchise those of us who are Irish citizens resident in the North beyond simply the holding of a passport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#L01800","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":857,"content":"<p>I think that the absence of a dispute mechanism in the Good Friday Agreement does not undermine or minimise the strength, weight and power that the Irish Government does have when it comes to the agreement.<\/p><p>It is a co-guarantor, and I think that what is needed now is for a realisation that the Irish Government does have that ability to take a stand in defence of this provision.

What today is underlining is that Ireland made fundamental constitutional changes as a consequence of the agreement.  The overriding concern at the moment is, for reasons that are about the peculiarity of the British constitutional legal system, the agreement has not found the home it needed to find within that system, and I think that needs to change.  If that means changing domestic law to reflect these things more effectively, then that must be done.   <\/p> <p>  I am going to underline something today speaking in a personal capacity.   I found myself in the public sphere recently in relation to a range of interventions, some of which have not been entirely pleasant, and somebody commented to me about what would be the case if we had an executive in the North.  It made me think about this evidence session today because that is an incredibly problematic narrative and it is suffocating political discourse on the island at the moment.  The idea that the answer to all the problems in Northern Ireland rest in an executive and an assembly is fundamentally wrong.  It is not true, and I think it is creating a dangerous narrative and expectations around any power-sharing administration that may return.  The things that we are talking about today rest within the gift of both governments to show leadership - to show, not tell.  This is a call today for both the British and Irish Governments to show, not tell.  The implementation gaps that we are identifying today primarily rest with either or both governments.  So in the spirit of showing and not just telling, it is about time both governments worked harder, as co-guarantors of that agreement, to take these forward and make them meaningful.<\/p> <p>  There are British-Irish negotiations ongoing around what is happening in terms of the power-sharing administration, but perhaps most significantly in the time ahead are the EU and UK negotiations, in which Ireland has a very significant voice.  We have seen the interventions from the US this week as well.  I am not somebody who overplays legal remedies, as important as they are.  There are also political negotiations upcoming on which pressure must be brought to bear on the British Government to address the range of implementation gap - including in Emma's and Jake's case - that we have outlined today.  The negotiations around the withdrawal agreement and protocol - as flawed and problematic as aspects of that are - did show there are ways to do this, so I think it is time for both governments really to step up in relation to the implementation gap that we have mentioned today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":861,"content":"<p>Ms Boyd, would you like to add anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#M00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":862,"content":"<p>Yes, I would just like to say that the engagement and the stance taken by the Irish Government, as Ms DeSouza said, was incredibly helpful and very strong, and we would like to see that continue and increase.  We can see clearly in this Upper Tribunal decision, and in the Home Office arguments, the stance that the UK Government is taking, which is this idea that the citizenship provisions were never enacted because that was the clear intention of the drafters - that there was no need and the British Nationality Act has always been in compliance with the Good Friday Agreement.  That is not even touching on the fact that UK policy and practice does not follow the Good Friday Agreement.  It does not reflect that, but the Irish Government following the Good Friday Agreement made significant legislative change to enact the citizenship provisions and it would be good to see a strong stance coming from the Irish Government on what the intention of the provisions were, and coming back against that argument that it is inconceivable that this is what it intended.  If this is the stance that the British Government is going to take, I would like to see a strong stance against that from the Irish Government, particularly in reflecting its own legislative actions, and perhaps on a smaller scale it would be good to see engagement with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's report and fresh calls for the Northern Ireland bill of rights.  Those are really increasing, and it would be good to see the Irish Government engage meaningfully with that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Una Boyd"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Thank you Ms Boyd.

F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m go m&oacute;r roimh Emma, Colin agus Una.  I just want to very quickly speak about the<b><\/b>empirical<b><\/b>experience.  First of all, let us start from the premise that this is entirely malicious.  I was one of the people who negotiated The Good Friday Agreement.  I was always uncomfortable that we were negotiating rights issues.  I always thought the best option was just to adopt best international practice.  I always thought it would come down to governments which are notoriously reluctant to give legislative effect to people's rights, and also given the nature of the North.  However we are where we are, and we got the Good Friday Agreement and it was a keystone agreement.  There were huge difficulties trying to get the British Government to give proper legislative effect to the agreement.  For example, we do not have a bill of rights, and it is not that the British Government do not know that, or that it has not been raised week in and week out for the last 21 years.  Neither do we have a charter of rights, because the Irish Government was supposed to bring in a charter of rights, and there was to be an all-Ireland charter of rights.<\/p><p>In this institution, the Good Friday Agreement falls victim to partisan politics, all the time.  It is only when one gets this sort of in-depth discussion of some of the issues involved that one can almost see people here starting to come to an understanding of what this is about.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann was changed, but the other side of that was that the Irish Government as of right, as opposed to having an aspirational symbolic - and in my opinion meaningless - constitutional claim to the North, was to have an involvement in all of these matters.  The onus therefore, I believe, is on the Irish Government, if one starts from my premise that this is entirely malicious.  Why do I say that?  It is because the British Government will always act in what it perceives to be its own interests.  If there is some immigration issue, or some other issue that the Home Office has responsibility for, that will take precedence and priority, and the people on the island of Ireland, or the northern part of the island, will fall victim to that.  They will be a secondary consideration.  The onus is very clearly on the Irish Government to act in this issue.  No matter how strong a statement there is from an Irish Government in these issues - and of course strong statements are very welcome -  they are not read in Downing Street.  They are not paid any attention to in the British Home Office.  They are not listened to even though it is important that the Government sets out its position in robust and strong terms.<\/p><p>The Government has to reach above itself.  Notwithstanding all the difficulties, we saw how the diplomatic weight of the Government, with the support of the parties in this institution, could be used to secure the least worst Brexit so far.  That approach also needs to be taken on this issue.<\/p><p> Time out of number, the Taoiseach has fudged a very important point.  Paragraph 52 of the political declaration, which declared that people in the North with Irish citizenship would have European citizens' rights, is not in the withdrawal agreement.  This provision was heralded as being bulletproof.  I cannot remember the various terms used to describe it but it was supposedly armour-plated.  It is not in the withdrawal agreement and, as such, we fell at the first hurdle when it came to the rights of people in the North.  The Government needs to accept that and work honestly on that issue.<\/p><p> After that meander, I would like to return to Ms DeSouza's case.  Every day, I and others see that ordinary people have to become activists and experts and have to put themselves out to secure rights in a large number of areas.  In that regard, Emma and Jake are to be commended on what they are doing.   Who is funding their case?  Working people have to go and raise funds by running raffles and ballots and holding fundraising events in local pubs.  That should not be the case.  I do not know if protocol allows it but back in the day an Irish Government took a case to the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of internees who had been tortured.  There should be some exploration of the possibility of the Government using diplomatic and other avenues.  It must also take responsibility.  If the people of the North are not to be left behind again by an Irish Government, this is a d&eacute;an &eacute; n&aacute; habair &eacute; moment.  The Government should something about this by adopting this case.  That in itself would put pressure on the British Government by showing that an Irish Government is prepared to support a legal case of this kind.  The question, which is not directed at the witnesses but at the committee, is whether there can be some space to show very practical support to Ms DeSouza because if she loses, we all lose.<\/p><p> Obviously, Brexit brought this case to a head but as we meander our way through Brexit, unionists will lose because they will lose their right to claim British citizenship.  Incidentally - I am going off on another tangent - there is no concept of British citizenship.  We are British subjects, not citizens so there is no definition of that.<\/p><p> To come back to my main point, however, everybody loses if Emma and Jake lose.  For this reason, I commend to the committee that it at least explore the possibility, among whatever other remedies it may have, of seeking practical support from the Government by having it adopt this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#M00700","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Would the witnesses like to give their views on the points Deputy Adams has raised?

It is a very difficult case for me and my husband to pursue for such a long period without any financial assistance or support.<\/p> <p>  I also want to address the point the Deputy made about paragraph 52 of the political declaration.  I agree that the fact that it did not make it into the withdrawal agreement is a failure.  As a citizen, I do not understand why that happened.  This ties into another point around citizens' rights.  We know that it falls entirely within the remit of Ireland to extend MEP seats to the North.  As a citizen, I do not understand why that option is not being pursued.  In the Brexit negotiations, we are seeing a watering down of rights.  The fact that, under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland born Irish citizens cannot access the EU settlement scheme whereas all other Irish citizens can is almost a breach of the agreement before it has even come to pass.  There are definitely big concerns to be raised about negotiating those rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma DeSouza"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Would Professor Harvey like to address any of those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#N00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Adams for his questions, on which I will make a number of reflections.  The Deputy will not get an argument from me on the British Government's track record on international agreements and human rights.  There is a sense that international pressure is important and that internationalising some of these issues can have an enormous effect.  What has been interesting about the Brexit discussions and the involvement of the United States and other parties is the way in which the British Government has been the weaker party.  I cannot remember another time in history where the British Government has been the weaker party in a negotiation where the Irish Government has been on the other side of the table.  In the context of that sort of negotiation, it is vital that outcomes are maximised, particularly where people are talking about the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  There is an imperative on the European Union, and the Irish State as an EU member state, to ensure that in the negotiations going forward the language of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts means something.  We are talking here about a right provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  Congress in the US has made itself clear in relation to any future free trade agreement and the commitments that would apply under the Good Friday Agreement.  Again, this is a right under the agreement so the more international pressure that is brought to bear on the British Government, the better.  It will not do so on its own but it can be encouraged to do the right thing in relation to the agreement.  As has been said, the British Government does not have a wonderful track record in implementing a number of aspects of the agreement.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the paragraph 52 issue, we have discussed a range of human rights and equality issues today.  I want to speak personally again.  I am an Irish citizen living in the North and this has a direct effect on me.  I underline the human rights of everyone in the North and on this island but there is a big problem in relation to the Good Friday Agreement that we have to state.  Certain Irish citizens are second class citizens on this island by some distance.  Irish citizens in the North who are now facing into Brexit will find themselves being second or third class European Union citizens as well.  That is a fundamental problem.  Now, 21 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, there is a stark problem with regard to parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality of treatment that specifically impacts upon Irish citizens in a broader context of a human rights implementation gap.  We have to be able to say that out loud and it has to be addressed.  It is one of the reasons, but not the only one, that the North is in the mess it is in.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Adams is absolutely right that remarkable and courageous civic leadership has been at the forefront of achieving change in relation to rights and equality.  I can only commend Emma and Jake on taking this courageous stand.  As I have made clear, they speak for many others in the work that they have done.  The Deputy also rightly raised the issue of capacity.  There comes a point in a range of civic conversations on this island, and on the question of civic leadership, where governmental resourcing and governmental level support and assistance are urgently required.  The Government needs to move beyond reassurances and the welcome warm words about the Good Friday Agreement and match those with actual practical action to support the implementation of the agreement in all its parts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":870,"content":"<p>adfadf<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019120400002#N00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1575417600,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I agree that it is very telling that in order to prevent Ms DeSouza having her husband live with her in the UK, the Home Office has taken this stance where it has dragged a family through the courts at the expense of the public purse, all to argue that it does not have to respect its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  At the end of the day, this came down to an immigration matter.<\/p><p>As was said, Brexit has really taken this beyond that.  We are now seeing how this policy alone will cause huge issues.  We have Northern Irish-born Irish citizens not able to access the EU settlement scheme, and there is no guarantee of how they will be able to legally enforce and protect their EU rights after Brexit.

I hope it is the sum of his ambitions for the foreseeable future.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to be here this afternoon.  I am joined by Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, Ms Liz Downey and Mr. Seamus Clifford from my Department and Mr. Michael Culhane, who is from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I thank the committee for making time available to consider the Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Department of Justice and Equality Votes.  The net amount of the Supplementary Estimate is &euro;17.5 million for the Garda Vote and &euro;33.3 million in respect of the Department of Justice and Equality Vote.  The Supplementary Estimate requirement in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote comprises a gross expenditure requirement of &euro;32.4 million that is offset by a projected surplus in appropriations-in-aid of just under &euro;15 million, giving a net additional requirement of &euro;17.5 million for the Garda Vote.<\/p> <p>  Significant measures have been taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the year to remain within budget and minimise the amount of any Supplementary Estimate that might be required.  The additional expenditure requirement mainly arises as a result of the security costs associated with the visits of United States President Trump and United States Vice-President Pence to Ireland this year.  This accounts for approximately &euro;15 million of the additional requirement.  The balance of &euro;2.5 million is to maintain capital expenditure for certain information and communication technology, ICT, projects, including the deployment of mobile technology.  This amounts to approximately &euro;1.5 million and additional investment in the transport fleet of approximately &euro;1 million accounts for the balance.<\/p> <p>  The additional investment in transport is mainly to replace older vehicles now reaching end of life and the increasing demands on existing fleet resources to support extra members assigned to front-line duties.  This brings the total capital fleet allocation to &euro;11 million in 2019, with a further &euro;9 million being provided in 2020.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in receipt of Internal Security Fund, ISF, funding for certain ICT capital and other projects.  On receipt of clearance from the European Union, EU, funding typically amounting to 90% of relevant expenditure is received.  Funding of almost &euro;3.4 million has been received in 2019 to match prior year expenditure of &euro;3.7 million.  As part of the Supplementary Estimate, a technical adjustment is being done to charge the expenditure to the relevant subheads and reflect the EU funding as an appropriation-in-aid.  The largest ICT project being funded in this manner is the Pr&uuml;m project, the objective of which is to provide for automated sharing between EU member states of certain categories of information for the purposes in particular of combating terrorism and cross-border crime.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that the Government is in a position to provide an additional &euro;17.5 million to the Garda Vote in 2019 to effectively provide for once-off events.  The Garda budget has been increased to a record &euro;1.882 billion for 2020.  This includes funding for recruitment of up to 700 garda&iacute; and additional Garda staff, depending on the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision on the balance required.  This allocation includes a capital provision of &euro;116.5 million a further increase of &euro;24 million, or 26%, from 2019.  This will provide for continued investment in ICT in the order of &euro;75 million, &euro;9 million for the Garda fleet and &euro;32 million for the capital building and refurbishment programme.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being provided with unprecedented funding and a major reform process is being supported to ensure the best possible policing services are provided to communities on the ground in all regions of the country.  I acknowledge the work of the work and engagement of the committee with the Garda Commissioner and his team in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Department of Justice and Equality Vote, there is a requirement for an additional &euro;33.3 million in the current year.  This arises despite every effort being made to deal with the pressures within the Vote, including with respect to the scale of the demands on direct provision, subhead E5.  It is estimated that the total outturn in this subhead will in the region of &euro;130 million compared with a budget allocation of &euro;70.65 million and this is the reason for the Supplementary Estimate this year.<\/p> <p>  The challenges in this area are well documented and were included in the spending review report published in August.  In summary, the trends underpinning the increasing costs in direct provision are as follows.  There has been a significant increase in the number of people seeking protection, and that number is up 60% to date this year.  As of 17 November 2019, there are 6,058 applicants being accommodated in 39 accommodation centres located nationwide across 18 counties and a further 1,499 applicants are residing in 37 emergency accommodation locations in hotels and guest houses.  This brings the total number of applicants for international protection to 7,557.  By comparison, the numbers in all forms of accommodation at the end of 2018 was 6,139 and in 2017 the figure was 5,096.<\/p> <p>  In order to manage matters the Department has put in place a number of measures aimed at reducing the time it takes to determine applications.  The International Protection Act 2015 introduced the single procedure process for the determination of protection applications.  Under the single procedure, all elements of a person&rsquo;s protection claim, including refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain, are considered together rather than sequentially.  The aim of the single procedure is to help reduce waiting times significantly.  The Department is aiming to reduce processing times for all first instance decisions to nine months by the end of this year.<\/p> <p>  The Department is also actively working on securing additional capacity both in existing centres and through sourcing new centres.  The International Protection Accommodation Service has sought expressions of interest from parties that would be interested in providing accommodation and related services and has also launched a nationwide, regional tendering process to source new accommodation centres.<\/p> <p>  The funding requirements and policy responses relating to direct provision will need to be kept under review on a whole-of-government basis throughout 2020.  An interdepartmental group has been established recently to enhance the provision of services from the range of Departments and agencies involved in providing direct provision services.  As part of that group's work, it is considering the use of State-owned sites.  The interdepartmental group is due to report shortly and the group&rsquo;s recommendations will have an impact on this area of expenditure.  The report will undoubtedly be on the committee's agenda early in the new year.  Former European Union Commission Secretary General Ms Catherine Day is currently chairing a separate group examining international best practice in the provision of services to international protection applicants with a view to advising the Government on medium to long-term service provision.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of other areas in the Vote where there are overspends and underspends and they are set out in the Supplementary Estimate briefing provided to the committee.  The overspends primarily relate to a number of the administrative subheads, including salaries and ICT, criminal legal aid, the Magdalen fund, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the coroner service.  The objective of providing an additional &euro;2.3 million to the Magdalen fund subhead is to finalise applications under the scheme at the earliest possible time.  It has been possible due to underspends in certain subheads and surplus receipts to offset these additional requirements and reduce the amount in respect of the costs of direct provision.<\/p> <p>  The larger underspend relates to the capital provision for the forensic science laboratory.  An amount of &euro;19.5 million, including capital carryover, was provided in 2019; it now appears that the underspend will be in the region of &euro;17 million.  Site preparation works have been carried out but the construction work has not commenced, pending the outcome of the tender process, which I understand is due to conclude very shortly.  Project management and delivery, including planning, procurement, architectural, mechanical and electrical aspects, will be the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, OPW, with funding being provided from the Department of Justice and Equality capital budget.<\/p><p>The OPW will chair the project team, comprising representatives of the OPW, Forensic Science Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department, and this will remain <i>in situ<\/i>for the duration of the project.  It is expected there will be surplus receipts of about &euro;20 million, which will also reduce the amount of additional Exchequer funding.  The surplus receipts are generated from a continuing upward trend in immigration registration and visa fees, together with approximately &euro;6 million in additional EU funding, mainly under the European Social Fund and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.  I thank the committee and I look forward to engagement on this issue.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#B00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for appearing before the committee today.

In the northern region, transport has seen a greater level of engagement, consequent on the investment.  A further &euro;11 million is being provided this year for augmenting the Garda fleet.  The projected figure is for in the region of 300 vehicles, be they patrol cars, vans or large sport utility vehicles, SUVs, for the armed support unit, with which the Deputy will be familiar as they are very much in evidence in the Border area.  As of 31 October, the &euro;11 million allocation has delivered 287 vehicles.  The disbursement of those vehicles across the various divisions is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner has prioritised the Border areas with particular reference to ongoing criminal activity.  I refer to the new armed support unit in Cavan that is up and running.  As well as having up to 23 personnel, the new unit also has vehicles.  There have been armed support units <i>in situ<\/i>for a number of years in Dundalk and Ballyshannon.  The extra armed support unit in Cavan will augment Garda personnel and equipment, including vehicles, in that area.  I am happy to assure the Deputy that new vehicles are on stream in the area.  On the replacement of vehicles, members will be aware the stock within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in need of ongoing replacement.

The latest figures I have show that 22% of the fleet is under two years old compared with 5% of the fleet being of that age in 2012.  We are ensuring that, over a period of time, emphasis can be placed on replacing the older vehicles in the fleet that are standard vehicles with high powered cars, vans, motorcycles and 4x4 vehicles.  I can give the Deputy a note on the position in Dundalk and County Louth but, as it is his constituency, he will be familiar with the situation in Drogheda where we saw a considerable increase in Garda numbers and appropriate equipment to meet a specific requirement in recent times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#C00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I am concerned not about the age of the vehicles but the mileage.  Many of the cars in the Dundalk and Drogheda areas could be used on a 24-hour basis and it would not take long to get 300,000 km on the clock.  The vehicle could be only two or three years old.  The age of the vehicle does not bother me.  The figure of 287 new vehicles seems high but I have a feeling that many more cars are coming off the road.  That is my main concern.  I appreciate the Minister's statement that he will revert to me with more details.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the increase in the budget for 2019 to 1.882 billion.  That is a large amount of money for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but it will be money well spent.  The Minister referred to the larger Garda presence in Drogheda, County Louth, which, in fairness, seems to be working.  I also welcome that 700 extra garda&iacute; passed out from Templemore in 2019.  It is important to see more garda&iacute; on the beat, more patrol cars and more speed checks.  A couple of years ago, the Minister stated that approximately 400 civilians would be employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take over clerical work.  I note that part of the &euro;1.882 billion is for additional Garda staff.  Will they be civilians?

We will continue to invest in the Garda fleet to allow the Garda Commissioner to ensure he has the best possible tools available to him.  Some 53% of the Garda fleet is less than four years old, whereas 12% of the fleet is less than one year old.  I take the point the Deputy makes about the mileage or number of kilometres done by Garda vehicles.  That is an issue I have discussed with the Garda Commissioner.  It is important the Garda ensures its fleet is up to the highest standard.<\/p><p>The object of the exercise, in terms of Government policy and also in terms of the ambition of the Garda Commissioner and his team, is that by 2021 we will have a Garda service of 21,000 personnel.  That will comprise 15,000 sworn members, of which we have just over 14,000 now, 4,000 Garda staff and 2,000 Garda reservists.  The Garda staff is extremely important in the context of the overall composition of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Commissioner is recruiting specialists in many areas, for example, in human resources, bookkeeping and accountancy, and IT.  An important theme throughout the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is ensuring that a level of expertise is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that oftentimes involves more than just the involvement of sworn members of the Garda.  There are currently just under 3,000 full-time Garda staff undertaking administrative and technical duties, which accounts for up to 15% of the Garda service.  Progress is continuing to be made on the matter of civilianisation.  Since 2018, over 500 garda&iacute; have been deployed from what might be regarded as desk, administrative or office duties to front-line policing duties.  Members of this committee will be very much aware of what the people want.  Citizens feel most assured by the availability and visibility of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Will the extra Garda staff coming on stream in 2019 help to increase the civilian staff from 3,000 to 4,000?  Is that going to happen in a short period?  If we can get a couple of hundred more garda&iacute; on the beat and on patrol, it would be very good.  I cannot complain because, in fairness, the situation we had in Drogheda was very serious and when the Garda Commissioner and Minister were asked to come, they left no stone unturned.

They are not new and I have no doubt they will continue.  I accept that they are the main reason for this Supplementary Estimate.  As Minister, I am keen to ensure that we manage our budgets in a way that obviates the need for Supplementary Estimates.  We have discussed this at the committee in the past.  Suffice it to say that the Supplementary Estimate we are discussing is, by and large, a result of a visit from the President of the US and a visit by the Vice President later in the year.

We must engage with the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Rural and Community Development and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I agree with Deputy Connolly that we have almost 850 overstayers, as they may be regarded.  These are people who have been given status and who are in a position to work and engage in our society and economy in the same manner as Irish citizens but who are unable to transition.

I am keen to move towards a mix of public and private sector accommodation, rather than relying exclusively on the private sector as we have done up to now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#F00900","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for assisting the committee, answering the questions raised by members, and assisting our consideration of the Supplementary Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#G00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1575417600,"counter":951,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#G00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":952,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Justice and Equality has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2019: Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and Vote 22 - Department of Justice and Equality. <\/blockquote> <p>Under Standing Order 89(2), the message is deemed to be the report of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#G00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1575417600,"counter":953,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.42 p.m. and resumed at 4.44 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Bill 2019: Committee Stage","time":1575417600,"counter":954,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#G00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":955,"content":"<p>The committee will now consider Committee Stage of the Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Bill 2019.

The Bill gives further effect to the thirty-seventh amendment to the Constitution by removing the statutory provisions that define an offence of blasphemy.  Members will recall that the Thirty-Seventh Amendment of the Constitution, which was approved by the people in last year&rsquo;s referendum, removed the requirement that publishing or uttering blasphemous matter shall be considered a criminal offence under Article 40.6.1(i).  Notwithstanding that referendum, the offence of blasphemy remains on the Statute Book, by virtue of sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009.  These sections were included in the 2009 Act by the then Government in an attempt to define an offence of blasphemy that would be consistent with the Supreme Court judgment in Corway <i>v. <\/i>Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Ltd.  This Bill proposes to repeal those sections, thus abolishing the statutory offence of blasphemy.<\/p><p>Section 1 is an avoidance of doubt provision, which aims to make it absolutely clear that the old common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel no longer exist.  Sections 2 and 3 remove the references to &ldquo;blasphemous&rdquo; in section 7 of the Censorship of Films Act 1923 and section 3(2) of the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Act 1925, which relate to civil matters.  While these amendments are not technically necessary to give effect to the referendum on the constitutional amendment, they are within the spirit of it.  Section 4 repeals sections 36 and 37 of the 2009 Act, thus abolishing the statutory offence of blasphemy and a related provision.  Section 5 is a standard citation and commencement provision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2019120400002#G00800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":957,"content":"<p>No amendments to this legislation have been tabled, so we will take each section in turn.

As the committee will be aware, in 2019, as the Government advanced its original preparations for the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, supplementary funds were not available for new initiatives or programmes.  However, the Department has successfully secured funds to support its ongoing work in some key areas.  As a result, &euro;10 million has been agreed with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to boost investment across the transport, tourism and sport sectors.  The &euro;10 million is being allocated as current expenditure, primarily in the two programme areas of public transport and tourism.  The Estimates for 2019 already provide an overall current allocation to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of &euro;755 million.  This additional money will now bring the total allocation to &euro;765 million.  Our total allocation is used to provide vital tourism investment, as well as to support the ongoing delivery of the remit of the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly go through the areas receiving this additional money.  As part of the land transport programme, in the public transport area, &euro;617,000 has been allocated to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  This is to fund an estimate of &euro;308,000 in pensions non-pay which arose during the re-profiling of the pension estimate in 2018 from pay to non-pay.  Some &euro;309,000 is to assist in the purchase during 2019 of preliminary breath test devices used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to test drivers for alcohol consumption.  A sum of &euro;583,000 has been allocated to the NTA to purchase approximately 325,000 anonymous Leap cards to ensure that sufficient stocks are in place early next year.  A further &euro;1 million has been provided to the NTA, with &euro;100,000 being allocated for additional general administrative expenditure, &euro;450,000 for ICT infrastructure licensing and system updates, and &euro;450,000 for rental costs associated with additional accommodation.  Those costs are required to be paid in advance under the terms of the rental contracts.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the sports programme, some &euro;800,000 is being allocated to Sport Ireland for high performance sport.  This funding will be used to assist athletes&rsquo; preparations for major competitions, including the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo and key World and European Championship events.  In the tourism programme, &euro;1 million will be spent by F&aacute;ilte Ireland on domestic marketing, with a particular focus on the Border counties.  This marketing will include social media campaign engagement with Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland consumers, data analytics on Northern Ireland consumers, a domestic print campaign and a local expert programme supporting Border counties.  Some &euro;6 million will be spent by Tourism Ireland on a programme of reassurance concerning Ireland as a tourist destination, given the uncertainties raised by Brexit.  The new deadline for Brexit means that the UK can still leave with no-deal if the withdrawal agreement with the EU is not ratified by the British Parliament by 31 January 2020.  As a result, it is vital that my Department continues to take steps to provide as much certainty as possible in our tourist markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019120400002#B00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1575417600,"counter":970,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his address.
