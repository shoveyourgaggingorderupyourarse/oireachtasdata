Obviously he has been here before and it is great to be back in the old Chamber of the Seanad.  I requested that the Minister attend today to discuss the national strategy of promoting viable trade routes between southern Ireland and the Continent, which is a major issue at the moment when Brexit is taken into consideration, and how connectivity and trade routes can be improved.  I am speaking specifically about such routes as the car ferries on the Cork-Swansea route, which left us many years ago, and the viability, in particular, of the French ferries, which are very important for our industries in both directions.  Brittany Ferries runs a fantastic operation but it is seasonal and operates at certain times.  It also operates another operation to the north of Spain which is also seasonal.  Such connectivity is a major issue for a growing economy such as in Cork and how we can promote this kind of interaction between both France and Ireland to ensure that the seasonal element of the ferries can be extended to a year-round commercial entity.<\/p> <p>This is one of the key issues for both tourism and connectivity.  Not alone will that promote the trade in vehicles but will also provide for the transport of containers.  At the moment if one has a container and needs to get it to the Continent, the Dublin Port scenario, unfortunately, comes into play.  With the potential we have in Cork, in particular, we need to be looking at viable options for promoting Cork and its port and to then drive on to ensure that we have these viable trade routes.<\/p> <p>This conversation is taking place  in the context of the Brexit debate.  The Minister is very up to date on that issue and has made some very keen statements in the last number of weeks on it.  I need that reassurance that we have that strategy, that potential and have those trade routes under way to ensure that, as we are going forward, they will be a real part of our strategy in promoting the southern region of Ireland, in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#B00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the House on this matter.<\/p> <p>I would like to confirm that shipping services to and from Ireland are market-driven and that the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime routes in and out of the State, both to the UK and continental Europe.  This is vital to facilitate both trade and tourism.  Nationally, Ireland is well-served by ferry links to the UK and continental Europe.  These links are frequent and competitive.  There are currently a total of 79 return sailings from the Republic of Ireland every week direct to Europe and there are 257 return sailings every week direct to and from the UK.  Shipping operates in a highly liberalised global market environment and the ongoing development of our shipping network has provided more competition, choice and frequency in accessing global markets.  <\/p> <p>Looking specifically at trade routes between southern Ireland and the Continent, the Port of Cork Company has been very proactive in seeking to establish direct routes to Europe.  A new route from Cork to northern Spain was announced on 16 January 2016 and the first service commenced on 9 May 2018.  This service is operated by Brittany Ferries, to which the Senator referred, and makes two return sailings a week from the Port of Cork to Santander.  In addition, the port has a well-established weekly return sailing from Cork to Roscoff in France.  The ferry can carry around 500 passengers and has space for 195 cars.  The service provides more choice for freight carriers which can bypass the UK landbridge and go directly to Europe, which is important as Brexit draws closer.  <\/p> <p>The Port of Cork is currently undertaking major development works, including the construction of a new container terminal at Ringaskiddy.  This work will enhance national port capacity and future increases in trade by facilitating larger vessels, increased tonnage and throughput.  <\/p> <p>In addition, the Port of Waterford has been very active in seeking to establish more direct links with the Continent.  This is in keeping with its long-term plans for growth and future development.  In July 2019, BG Freight Line, in partnership with Maersk, announced the commencement of new weekly lift-on, lift-off freight service on the Waterford-Rotterdam route.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This acts as a deep-sea feeder route for businesses which are exporting or importing goods globally through Europe's largest seaport.<br\/><br\/>This service from the Port of Waterford provides a wider choice to Irish importers and exporters in the south east.  Last year, Irish Rail and Rosslare Europort, an important ro-ro port, completed a report on Rosslare and approved a &euro;15 million investment plan for the strategic development of the port.  Shannon Foynes port is also currently engaged in a major capital expenditure programme to increase capacity.  The port is actively exploring opportunities to develop new routes.  The port is talking to businesses in the catchment area, to shipping companies and to ports on the Continent about the feasibility of new routes.<br\/><br\/>Brexit highlights the importance of connectivity from Ireland to the Continent.  Shipping companies in the past have responded to economic developments and increased or decreased capacity in response to changing developments.  In preparation for Brexit, some shipping companies have already commenced providing additional capacity on direct routes to Europe.  CLdN launched a new &euro;234 million ro-ro freight ferry, the <i>MV Celine<\/i>, with a capacity of 8,000 lane metres, on the Rotterdam-Zeebrugge-Dublin route in October 2017.  CLdN has also introduced additional capacity on its direct route to Europe with its vessel, <i>Laureline<\/i>.  In addition, Irish Ferries' investment of &euro;150 million in its newest passenger and freight vessel, <i>MV W.B. Yeats<\/i>, provides year-round freight capacity between Ireland and France of 165 HGVs per sailing, or 60,600 HGVs per annum.  Another vessel of similar size to the <i>W.B.

The Office of Public Works is to be congratulated on a marvellous piece of work.<\/p> <p>Alas, that is not why we are here today.  We are here at the request of Councillor Paddy McQuillan in regard to St. Laurence's Gate in Drogheda.  To give some background to the issue, two and half years ago a committee was formed with the purpose of closing the historic and iconic St. Laurence's Gate to public transport and, instead, opening the gate as a tourist attraction for the town.  It is already listed on the Discover Ireland website as being widely regarded as one of the finest of its kind in Europe.  However, with increased traffic through the town, the gate was being damaged, particularly by trucks that were being sent through it by satellite navigation systems.  Indeed, I have some photographs of trucks stuck under the gate and the resulting wear and tear on its structure.<\/p> <p>There was great excitement when the newly-established committee got together in Louth County Council and a traffic management plan was designed and implemented, and the gate was closed to traffic.  Unbelievably, it is now two years on and the gate is still lying idle, and a very busy tourist season has come and gone without the gates being opened to the public as a visitor attraction.  The road markings have not even been removed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

It was briefly open to the public during the two recent fleadhanna cheoil.  Those events were sold out each day.<\/p><p>It would appear that since the council owns the surrounding land and the Office of Public Works, OPW, owns the protected structure, the delay lies somewhere between the two bodies, but it has proven difficult for councillors and those involved in the campaign to have the gate reopened to get a definitive answer.<\/p><p>The gate was built in 1280 and has survived to the present day, but it needs careful work if its structure is to be protected.  This is particularly true regarding the south tower, which I understand is structurally damaged and needs repair.  Bringing the tower up to the standards required to make it a safe and sustainable visitor attraction will require investment by the OPW, but time is of the essence.  Given the work done in Leinster House, there is no organisation better qualified to bring a building back to its original standards than the OPW.<\/p><p>County Louth has an impressive tourism offering and an enviable built and natural heritage set in a unique location at the very heart of Ireland's Ancient East.  The council and its economic forum have a strong and achievable tourism plan with Drogheda as a gateway town at the centre, but, sadly, without its historic gate.  What plans has the Minister of State for the tower's renovations?  When can the people of Drogheda expect the gate to be fully restored and open to the public for tourism business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#C00400","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his welcome words for my OPW staff and colleagues.  I also thank the Houses of the Oireachtas, which have done a tremendous job.  People might complain about what it cost to do up Leinster House, but the damage was only visible after the plaster was peeled back.  The finished article is now a house for the future.  I wish Senators the best of luck in the year ahead.<\/p> <p>The St. Laurence's Gate building is an iconic structure in Drogheda and is instantly recognisable as a reminder of the ancient town defences.  It is a 13th century barbican and was one of the entry points to the town in medieval times.  It is a strong visual reminder of Drogheda's past.<\/p> <p>The major issue with the gate in recent years was the fact that the roadway through it had been used for ordinary traffic purposes until 2017 when the local authority decided that vehicles should be rerouted away from the archway.  It was the OPW's view at the time that this was essential to prevent further physical damage to the monument, as repeated vehicle strikes had given rise to serious alarm over the years and there was a genuine fear that it might be compromised or even terminally damaged.  The OPW was relieved when the difficult decision was taken locally to remove the traffic threat from the area.  I applaud the members and executive of Louth County Council for taking that decision.<\/p> <p>Having resolved the traffic issue, the question arises as to what steps are necessary to realise the full potential of the gate and how to reopen it to the public, thereby creating a new focal point and a tourism attraction in the town.  This needs the co-operation of the OPW, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the local authority, each of which has a role to play.  There is no doubt that this is a very challenging proposition, one fraught with difficulty.  Two major issues present: first, how to arrange safe access into the interior of what is a compact and confined space in a way that is suitable and enjoyable for visitors and, second, how to deal with the building's multiple serious structural issues in a way that preserves its stability and structural integrity.<\/p> <p>The gate building can actually be visited on special arrangement.  This option has been open to the public previously and was done on a number of occasions on foot of special arrangements made as part of the heritage week, recent fleadhanna cheoil, and the other local festivals that the Senator referenced.  I confirm that the building will continue to be available for opening on request for special events.  These limited openings have proven popular and serve as a direct reminder of the locals' pride in this landmark building and the potential it holds for visitor attractions in Drogheda.<\/p> <p>Bearing that in mind, the OPW and Louth County Council have co-operated since the traffic closure in trying to find a way to have the gate open to the public continuously.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2454\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2454&amp;amp;pid=KevinBoxerMoran&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The council has also prioritised proposals for creating a landscape plan for the surrounding area and developing a public realm project to improve the immediate vicinity of the building.  However, the single most serious and pressing issue that is causing difficulty and impeding progress is the structural condition of the building.  This has been prioritised over any other issue since it calls into question the continued stability of the monument.<\/p><p>As a result of a structural assessment in early 2017 by external consultant engineers working for the OPW, major cracks and structural weaknesses that have significantly compromised the building were discovered.  This means that in the view of both the OPW and the structural consultants the building is unsafe for unrestricted general access and, although the OPW can continue to open it under supervision for special occasions, it cannot be fully opened as a visitor attraction in its current condition.  The OPW has been working on the development of a scheme of works to counteract this problem with the assistance of its engineers and is aiming to advance a project at the site when this has concluded.<\/p><p>I must caution the Senator that this is a very complex and challenging works proposal.  The OPW is not in a position to say when it will be concluded and a stabilised building provided.  The OPW is conscious of the need to progress this project.  However, there are a significant number of urgent and pressing needs at other monuments in the Louth-Meath area and resources will at times have to be prioritised to deal with those.  I appreciate that this will cause some disappointment as I am sure that locals were hopeful that the gate would soon become a favourite destination for visitors.

Following on from a patronage appointment process, the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, was appointed as patron of this new school.  The final grant of planning permission was received on 30 August 2019 from Fingal County Council for the development of interim accommodation for the school at 85-87 Main Street, Swords, in order to ensure that the school would open in September 2019.  It was then necessary to seek alternative interim accommodation and the school opened in suitable contingency accommodation on a Department-owned site in Drinan on the south side of Swords, the area which the school was established to serve.  The school is located there at the moment but is moving to Rivervalley.  Once work has been completed on the site at 85-87 Main Street, the school will relocate to interim accommodation on that site in due course.  <\/p> <p>The Minister is committed to providing a permanent accommodation solution for the school at an early date but the acquisition of a suitable site is required to facilitate the delivery of this project.  The DDLETB, as school patron, is currently advancing a site acquisition process with the assistance of the Department of Education and Skills.  A potential site option in the Rivervalley area has now been identified.  Following on from initial engagement with the relevant landowners, a more detailed technical assessment of the site is now being undertaken.  The Senator will understand that this must be done before the site can be purchased.  That said, I believe that the site in question is more than adequate.  Of course the Senator will appreciate the importance of ensuring the technical feasibility of any proposed site to ensure that the required level of accommodation can be provided and to mitigate any potential planning risks to the project.  I can assure Senator Clifford-Lee that the Department and the DDLETB are working to progress matters as quickly as possible.  They have been in constant contact in recent weeks with a view to securing a permanent site for Rivervalley community national school at the earliest possible date.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Halligan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Once a site for the school has been secured, the project to deliver its permanent accommodation can be progressed to the architectural planning process.

A huge amount of work has been done during those two years, much of it invisible.  That is because the restoration project was mainly concerned with strengthening floors, improving fire insulation and rationalising the cabling that has proliferated under floors and behind walls over many years.  It was about ensuring that a 270 year old family home was equipped to serve as the home of our national Parliament for at least another century.  That said, anyone who has walked through the corridors and seen this Chamber will have been impressed by the magnificent job that has been done to enhance the presentation of Leinster House to the increasing number of people who visit the Oireachtas every year.  This is a building that we can be proud to show to the school children and community groups, the tourists and the foreign delegations we welcome daily to the Chamber.<\/p> <p>I am pleased that the project has allowed us to adapt the Chamber in order to ensure improved access for people with disabilities.  Proper provision has been made for wheelchair users, whether visitors or Members.  Camera points to facilitate Irish sign language broadcasting have been installed and the loop system for those with hearing difficulties has been upgraded.<\/p> <p>Many people have contributed to the success of this restoration project.  From the point of view of the Seanad, the restoration would never have been possible if we had not found a suitable place in which to conduct our business while the work was being carried out.  I have to express particular gratitude to the director, board and staff of the National Museum of Ireland who facilitated our sittings in the Ceramics Room and the Japanese Room.  Under the exemplary stewardship of the Ceann Comhairle and Chair of the Oireachtas Commission, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, an excellent relationship has been developed with our next door neighbours in the museum, a relationship which, I have no doubt, will endure and develop further to the mutual benefit of our two institutions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">An Cathaoirleach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1988\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend, in particular, the Office of Public Works which oversaw the restoration.  An historic building that is nearly three centuries old presents considerable technical challenges and responsibilities.  The work the OPW has done in Leinster House speaks positively to its reputation for highly-competent and sensitive management of the State's stock of historic buildings.  The main contractor, Duggan Brothers, and the many subcontractors involved in the restoration deserve our gratitude for their sterling work, as do our own contractors who manage the electronic voting, sound and broadcasting systems.  Last but not least, the staff of our own facilities management unit have been immersed in this project for the past few years.  They have worked flat out, especially throughout the summer, to ensure the effective co-ordination and delivery of the many aspects of the complex project.  Special mention must be made of Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Brien, who has worked tirelessly to ensure Leinster House would be open for our sitting day.<br\/><br\/>I thank all the staff of the Seanad for their patient endurance and the staff of the Houses who helped us over the past two years in a different facility.  I acknowledge the presence today of acting Superintendent, John Flaherty.  I thank all the Leinster House staff, including the ushers, who have been so facilitating, courteous and kind not only to me but also to all the Members.  On behalf of all Members of the Seanad, I thank everyone involved for a job well done.

The fantastic work on the restoration of the building, which has been painted in colours similar to those of 1748 when similar colour patterns were used, represents a wonderful achievement for all involved.  It brings to mind a quotation that my father taught me around the fireside in west Cork when I was a child.

I am glad he is here for the opening of business.  It is great to see him.<\/p> <p>It is now 37 days until 31 October.  Most of the media commentary and political discourse over recent months has been about Brexit, Boris and the budget.  Today's UK Supreme Court judgment was unanimous.  It is very striking.  It has been confirmed that Westminster is meeting tomorrow to discuss the ramifications of the judgment.  We all hope in this House that some common sense will prevail across the UK parties and that they will focus on what the majority have already said about preventing a hard and disorderly Brexit on 31 October.  While common sense has not been in abundance in the United Kingdom of late, it is crucial that Ireland not become a casualty of any premature, knee-jerk political reactions.  There has been a sense for quite some time that Ireland has not been ready for a hard Brexit and that there has been an all-right-on-the-night attitude seeping in.  This needs to change rapidly.  There were mixed messages last week after the UK Prime Minister visited Dublin.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There were descriptions of a positive mood music at the start of the week but these were dampened down completely towards the end of the week.  There has been some stop-start momentum building up.  The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, says he is anxious to get a deal, yet he and his Government have still not produced any written papers for the EU as to how they believe the Single Market will be protected on the island of Ireland or how border checks will be prevented.  He said he would rather die in a ditch than apply for an extension.  We still do not know the impact of this morning&rsquo;s UK Supreme Court judgment on parliamentary motions.  These are not insignificant stumbling blocks.  Jean-Claude Juncker made this clear when he met the UK Prime Minister at the end of last week.  We all need to be wary of not falling into rhetoric and remain focused on protecting jobs, regions and trade in Ireland.<\/p><p>The budget, due in two weeks&rsquo; time, will be dominated by Brexit.  Some commentators are calling it boring as there have been no threatening redlines or demands from Fianna F&aacute;il that could cause instability.  Our sensible and pragmatic approach annoys them and some in Fine Gael.  Our party agreed to a fourth budget because of Brexit and nothing else.  We put the country first and foremost.<\/p><p>We are all used to Senator Buttimer hitting out at Fianna F&aacute;il regularly.  He rarely stands up in the Chamber without taking a pop at our party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It is an interesting tactic when he knows Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is not here to defend himself against his many spurious accusations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#O00400","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Any jobs in the Cork South Central constituency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#P00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Name them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#P00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>You, Leader,<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#P00400","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>As Michelle Obama said some time ago, when political opponents go low, we go high.  I intend to do that.  There is only so much space available on the high moral ground.  I do not intend to take that position from the Leader.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has some priorities and demands in this budget with discussions in this regard ongoing.  These include prioritising sectoral protection measures in the agrifood, tourism and small and medium-sized enterprise sectors against the potential devastating impacts of Brexit.  We also want to protect the poor and the vulnerable by ensuring this is a progressive budget.  It was interesting to read the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech to the UN about the introduction of a carbon tax.  Instead of a dividend being introduced, he announced a ring-fenced fund.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been calling for this for a long time.  We welcome this U-turn as it is the only way of protecting against fuel poverty.<\/p> <p>Outside of the bubbles of Leinster House and of Brexit, there are everyday issues, namely, housing, health and the ever-increasing cost of living, which are having a negative impact on people and cannot be ignored.  With rents at such a high level, a whole generation of people are being locked out of the housing market.  Today, we read of Kennedy Wilson boasting that it made more money on rents in Dublin than in Los Angeles.  This is a damning indictment of the Fine Gael Government.  The housing system is broken.  While there have been many announcements, the Government sadly lacks delivery.  The home ownership rate stands at 68%, the lowest since 1971.  Countries such as Germany and Austria have seen significant increases in home ownership while ours has fallen.<\/p> <p>People are struggling to pay childcare costs and even avail of it.  Our transport system is creaking.  Our quality of life is suffering.  Yesterday, we had the bizarre situation of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann being forced to ask passengers to stagger their journey times to reduce overcrowding.  This shows how out of control the public transport system has become.  I have constantly called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to address overcrowding issues on the northern commuter line.  He promised that 28 carriages would be refurbished and delivered but this still has not happened.<\/p> <p>There are issues around the direct provision system.

It is superb and I listen to it all the time.<\/p><p>With regard to the redecoration of the House, I congratulate those involved, particularly on the fact they left the ceiling in the original colours.  These are quite lovely and so much better than it was in the 1950s and 1960s, with those dull brown colours.  There are also the magnificent Waterford glass chandeliers.  We can all be proud of this Irish artwork.  I am a little surprised by the existence of what are, apparently, two mobile telephones on the ceiling.  There is a kind of blob beneath them.  I am also not quite so crazy about the mustard colour on the walls.  I would have preferred a lighter colour.  All in all, however, it is an absolutely superb job and we are delighted to be back.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a couple of issues.  The first concerns a man called Paul Graham, who is 80 years old.  Mr. Graham was born and raised in the Church of Ireland's Bethany Home in Dublin but he has been refused an Irish passport.  It is quite extraordinary that an Irishman, born presumably of Irish parents, although unknown, is being denied an Irish passport at the end of his days.  This is completely wrong.  The second issue is from a religious sister who contacted me about an article by Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  The 27th Amendment states, &quot;... a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law.&quot;  While it is rather badly drafted, it does seem to rule out people.  I think this is completely wrong and it is totally against the position in America, for example, as anybody born in America is automatically an American citizen.<\/p><p>The third matter I want to raise concerns the qualification of an unbroken year's residence when applying for naturalisation.  This can create problems.  One person wrote to me and pointed out that his job involves travelling abroad to represent the company by which he is employed.  The qualification to which I refer would make this impossible.  The position in respect of this matter must be reconsidered.<\/p><p>I salute the very remarkable judgment of the British Supreme Court.  It is quite remarkable that the 11 judges on the court unanimously held that Johnson's proroguing of the UK Parliament was unlawful and that he unlawfully advised the Queen.

I believe we can do something practical in this House.  The power-sharing Executive collapsed as a result of cash for ash and there has been no democratic voice in the Assembly since then.  Considering what has happened in London, it is now urgent to get the Assembly back up and running.  It would be helpful if we could have a debate with the Minister on what practical things can be done to get the power-sharing Executive back up and running at this dangerous period in Irish history.  Let us clearly recall the reason it collapsed.  Can we put a protocol in place in respect of cash for ash, set aside preconditions and get the Assembly back in place and focused on representing the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic and the dangers they face with a breakdown of negotiations on Brexit, which is where I believe we are going?<\/p> <p>I wish to raise another point with the Leader on which he might facilitate me.  He has heard me on many occasions raising legacy issues for apartment owners.  I quoted the figure of approximately 70,000 apartment owners who are facing legacy issues, with bills ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;52,000 to rectify their apartments.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said that the State will not take on responsibility for this, but the State has stepped into other areas such as the dodgy cement blocks used in Donegal and Mayo as well as pyrite.  We cannot leave so many apartment owners swinging in the wind with huge financial debt and threats from fire officers that they will have to vacate their homes.  Before the recess I asked the Minister of State, Deputy English, to facilitate meetings and he said he would.  Unfortunately, that did not happen over the summer.<\/p> <p>Will the Leader use his good offices to contact the Minister on behalf of this House, as many other Members, including the Leader, have raised this issue as well?  We must work out a practical solution for people who bought apartments with legacy, fire and water egress issues.  Basically, they were poorly built apartments due to the lack of regulation.  There is an onus on us.  The legislation relating to self-certification was changed in this House and the D&aacute;il so there is a responsibility to work out a solution for the 70,000 families.  As I said, something was worked out with regard to dodgy cement blocks in Donegal and Mayo and in some circumstances in respect of pyrite.  Assistance must be given to people who own apartments and are in danger of losing their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#U01000","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I remind Senators that the leaders of each group are allowed three minutes to speak.

I have often said that we view Brexit as the British accidentally shooting themselves in our foot.  That said, there is goodwill in the Parliament of the United Kingdom and in this Parliament.  We are committed Europeans but we want to remain good friends with the United Kingdom.  We also want to ensure that the United Kingdom remains a good friend of the European Union.  Up to 80% of our colleagues in Westminster and the House of Lords do not believe that Brexit is good for the United Kingdom, for relations between Ireland and the UK or for the EU.  The fact that common sense appears to be prevailing must be welcomed.<\/p> <p>On another note, which may be related to Brexit, I was truly appalled by the depraved attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney, a Quinn Industrial Holdings director who is now dealing with life-changing injuries.  Last night, I watched the \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme on television and felt a chill as another Quinn Industrial Holdings director, Mr. John McCartin, a colleague and good friend, spoke about constant threats, including death threats, and the campaign of intimidation against company executives, including himself, over the past five years.  Both Kevin Lunney and John McCartin are married with young children.  What Kevin Lunney was subjected to, having been abducted by a criminal gang and tortured for over three hours, does not bear thinking about.  Some of the  newspaper reports of what the thugs reportedly did to Mr. Lunney were stomach-churning and raise serious questions about how close we are to the breakdown of law and order in parts of the Border region.  Indeed, the journalist Ms Dearbhail McDonald said on \"Claire Byrne Live\" last night that the campaign of violence and intimidation is one of the greatest challenges to the rule of law since we signed the Good Friday Agreement and it is hard to disagree with that analysis.  The warning signs have been there for several years.  <\/p> <p>I commend the good work being done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in investigating this incident.  It is imperative that not only are the foot soldiers apprehended but also those who paid the gang to carry out this brutal act.  Another question that must be asked is why these Quinn Industrial Holdings executives were not given sufficient protection against a background of sustained intimidation over the past five years.  If garda&iacute; can be posted outside the homes of at-risk gangland members, surely the state, North and South, can protect these citizens against loss of life?  Another worrying question is why threats posted on Facebook against company management have stayed up for years.  This hateful content was only removed by Facebook last Sunday night.  This is a question that Facebook must answer.  Last Friday, like thousands of others, I attended a peaceful protest in support of and solidarity with Quinn Industrial Holdings management and employees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some nine and half years earlier, I was part of a cross-party delegation that met Se&aacute;n Quinn and his management team in a bid to save jobs.

This is undoubtedly the feeling in the local community, which relies so heavily on Quinn Industrial Holdings to sustain employment and the economy in the north-west region and along the Border.  We must never lose sight of that fact.

They show that the number on the waiting list increased from 6,238 at the end of March to 7,346 at the end of July, an increase of 18% in four months.  The list for the Cavan-Monaghan region now stands at 326 people.  It is important that we do not forget that behind these figures are vulnerable, elderly people and their families.  Older people want to stay in their own homes.  They are happier, healthier and more content there.  Unfortunately, in many instances discharges from our acute hospitals are delayed simply because there are no home care packages in place for the patients in question.  Beds are held up, which causes a backlog throughout the entire system.  Many of our vulnerable elderly are also forced into nursing homes as a result of this lack of home care packages.  The policy makes no sense either from the perspective of health or from a financial perspective.  Figures I recently came across highlight that very point.  To keep someone in an acute hospital setting for one week costs the taxpayers of this country &euro;6,000.  To keep someone in a nursing home for one week costs anywhere between &euro;1,300 and &euro;1,400.  A home care package of 6.5 hours costs the taxpayer &euro;165 per week.  Those figures say it all.

It is important and timely that this has happened.  The factories are now free to return to slaughtering cattle and farmers who were under great pressure to get their animals slaughtered can now do so.  This will help to protect our meat industry and the jobs of workers who have been discommoded by the blockades and the inability of the factories to process meat.  I will, however, point out and highlight that the farmers who stood at the gates did so simply because they have no bargaining power when dealing with the meat processors.  They go to a factory to have their animals slaughtered and must take the price offered.  There is no negotiation.  The farmers who stood at the gates have succeeded in making the public and the mainstream media conscious of the fact that they are producing animals at a loss while the multiple retailers and meat processors in our food supply chain and beef industry are all making profits.  When the farmers run into difficulty they have to come to Government to bail them out and to assist them.  This is not sustainable.  There is more work to be done, but I want to acknowledge and compliment the farmers, who conducted themselves in a very fine manner in this regard.  It was a desperate act, but it is a desperate situation.  I hope all energies will now be focused on finding real, long-term solutions for the sustainability of our primary producers, our farmers, in the beef industry.<\/p> <p>I will refer to the beef exceptional aid measure, which received sign-off from the European Commission and the Minister, Deputy Creed, in July.

The money that is given is very welcome.  The farmers who are down on their luck are really down on their luck.  I suggest that the reference period during which farmers are given a subsidy for the slaughter of animals should be extended.  At the moment, it runs from 24 September 2018 to 12 September 2019.  I am asking for it to be pushed out to July to enable any farmer who presents with his cattle during the extended period to apply.  We should spend the remaining funds of approximately &euro;22 million which have not been claimed by farmers.  We will be going to the EU Commission again to look for money because of the uncertainty associated with Brexit.  Obviously, we do not know right here and now.  I do not think it would be good policy on our part to be sending any money back.  Farmers desperately need it.  There is scope to extend the terms of reference.

Lyric FM's budget is a tiny percentage of RT&Eacute;'s total budget.  It has been suggested that its budget is &euro;6 million, whereas RT&Eacute; has revenues of &euro;340 million.  We are talking about 1% or 2%.  It seems that RT&Eacute; has decided to deal with that.  If it had cut some of the top salaries, it probably would have found &euro;6 million handy enough.

We have seen what has happened in the UK today.  We keep saying it is unprecedented and it is not going to happen.  We cannot believe what is happening.  Every day, something new happens and we say the same things.  Dublin Port has 3 km of road available, but it will need far more than that in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I urge everybody on our side and on the UK side to try to keep cool heads and get some kind of a deal that works for us as well as possible.  Obviously, most of us would prefer if Article 50 were revoked.  I do not see that happening.  We should try to focus on the least worst deal that is available.<\/p> <p>We all need to play our part on the issue of climate change.  We need to bring in the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on a far more regular basis to discuss what is happening.  It is great that young people and their families are concerned, but we need to look at everything from our settlement strategy to how we build our schools and hospitals, how we allow people to build houses and how we get around.  Irish Rail has told people to try to travel earlier or later because the Minister has not sanctioned enough rail carriages for them.  We need more public transport.  We need capacity on that public transport at the right times.  This is something that is in the hands of the Government, but it has refused to take action.<\/p> <p>We urgently need to do something about the cost of insurance, which the Seanad has debated on many occasions.

This demands a Limerick-style solution, as was necessary with the Dundon gang.  It demands a similar solution to that which was necessary to deal with the gangland wars in Dublin.  It demands the kind of response that we had to the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin some years ago.  It is of that proportion and level of crisis.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to join in the condemnation and, in particular, impress upon the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the nature of the concerns I have articulated about policing numbers, treating the situation as an emergency and giving it a Limerick status.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask that, at an appropriate time, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, come to the House to make an appropriate statement.

According to a recent report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, an Irish woman's weekly income is &euro;153 less than that of an Irish man in retirement.  The report found that women were less likely to receive a contributory pension than men and that, among those who did, their average income was much lower than the average income received by men, while taking years out to look after children meant a reduction in contributory pension and this has affected women disproportionately.  They have generally worked for fewer years at retirement and this means they have also had less time to build up a private pension.  According to the report, over 90% of retired men had worked for more than 30 years compared with just 33% of retired women.  We need to look at how the contributory pension is allocated.  We were worth nothing for all the years of raising this generation and, for the benefit of that same generation, we now need to look at policies to enable a greater contribution in the workforce by women.  Policies which enable greater continuity in employment and encourage fewer gender traps are called for now.  We need to examine our policies to create more affordable childcare and long-term care services and to ensure those policies are robust enough to enable women to stay in the workforce.<\/p> <p>The report underlines how the Government's plans to look at private pensions as the saviour will do nothing to address the pay gap, because the numbers will stay the same.  Women are more likely to earn less and have less secure employment, meaning they cannot build a private pension in the same way men can.  It is high time we valued the work women do in raising families in their homes.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il are working hard to increase the home carer tax credit, but this measure is not enough of an acknowledgement of the savings delivered to the State by the women who stay at home to raise families.  While some dads do this, the majority are women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#Z00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#Z00300","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I wonder if we need to look at having a minister for women.

Today's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>reports on the publication of an audit of food offered in canteens in six schools.  The idea of food being available in schools was designed to promote healthy eating but the survey indicates food is being offered that does not represent health eating.  Items such as chips and muffins have been introduced partly because the companies providing the service are not making a profit from promoting healthy eating items of food.  This is a worrying trend when we want to decrease the level of obesity but we find it is increasing among our young people every year.  If schools are not able to deliver in this area, we face a major challenge.  The audit was carried out in six schools by the school of public health in UCD.  It is an interesting study and it sounds alarm bells about this issue.  We need to ask the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education and Skills to co-operate to ensure this trend does not continue and to work out a plan for healthy eating and encourage young people to buy into it.<\/p><p>There is a related issue concerning medical practice in that GPs are reluctant to raise the issue of obesity with parents whose children are clearly overweight.

The staff were not aware of the possibility of a threat to Lyric FM.  What is required is clarity about its future, both as RT&Eacute; Lyric FM and that it will continue to be based in Limerick city.  I have a letter dated 20 February 1997 in which the then Minister with responsibility for the arts and now President, Michael D. Higgins, approved the establishment of RT&Eacute; Lyric FM.  It came on foot of a Government Green Paper and RT&Eacute; actively pursued the setting up of Lyric FM.  It has been a resounding success.  It has retained it numbers.  It provides quality programmes.  It is branded.  Twenty three staff members are based in Lyric FM.  In terms of its cost, the licence fee goes directly to what its does, which is to broadcast classical music.  Its remit should be extended to the arts.

This Government, led by An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has been very much to the fore in ensuring the green jersey is worn across the world, not just in Europe.  That is evidenced by the solidarity we have received so far, which culminated this morning in the meetings which were held in New York.  We also had the unanimous decision of the UK Supreme Court today.<br\/><br\/>Senators Clifford-Lee, Conway-Walsh, Norris, Coghlan, O'Sullivan, Humphreys, Devine, Feighan and Horkan referred to Brexit, the UK Supreme Court judgment and Northern Ireland.  I want to make it clear, in case people have forgotten, that there have been no mixed messages from this Government.  There has been a consistent, clear line from this Government.  The Taoiseach has been emphatic, as have other members of the Government, regarding the binding assurances required that there will not be a hard border.  While the decision by the Supreme Court in the UK, which is a different jurisdiction, is a matter for the UK Parliament, all of us should celebrate the primacy of parliament being upheld in the UK today.  As Members of Parliament, Members of this House and the Lower House should be conscious of what they say and how they say it.  Part of our job is to hold the Executive to account but we must also hold public bodies to account and pass legislation in a manner befitting a parliament.  Our language and behaviour are important.<br\/><br\/>I welcome all Senators back and wish all of them a very successful term.  Whether we finish in November or May 2020 or whether we go on until 2021 is work for another day.  We are back and it is our job to work collectively to ensure that the public good is served in this House.  I assure Senators of my co-operation at all times in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Senator Clifford-Lee raised the issue of climate change.  To be fair, on one level a green tax should be examined.

Even though that is the case, perhaps there may be a chance to discuss it when discussing the section.  Amendments Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, propose very small changes, but I hope the Minister might agree that important issues arise in terms of inconsistency with some of the previous language and with the language in the new proposal relating to self-employed persons and the services or supports they may seek to access relating to social protection services.  The Minister is aware that we have discussed with her the importance of a positive approach to activation.  We have common views on that, namely, that there should be a positive perspective whereby we ensure that people are offered appropriate employment, training or educational opportunities and that we also ensure that each person individually in his or her interaction with Intreo and the social protection or activation services of the State is appropriately supported and given choices and options.  I am concerned that the section as currently worded has slightly more punitive language and what I believe could be construed as a narrowing of the options for the individual, which is a little bit inconsistent with what we previously had.  Perhaps that is intentional or perhaps it is inadvertent.<\/p><p>Specifically, amendment No. 2 proposes the deletion of these sections.  If the Minister does not wish to accept my amendments, she will have an opportunity to submit a revised version of those two sections on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 3 suggests that rather than the language of refusal or failure to attend activation meetings related to jobseeker's benefit being the lead point, perhaps it might be a more positive and constructive engagement if we were to talk about activation services related to jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed, which may well include situations where persons do not engage as well as situations where they do engage.  While the payments are represented in different sections, the activation supports are almost primarily identified through the question of refusal or failure to attend.  There is a danger of a climate, which I do not think we should be pushing forward, of distrust or, to some degree, of blame.  A positive framing of the activation services would be better.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 suggests the deletion of the section with the hope that the Minister might put forward an alternative framing or phrasing of it.  Those are some of the key points.  Amendment No. 5 concerns lines 33 and 34 in page 9.  Rather than simply stating &quot;may require the person to whom it is given to do&quot;, we would substitute &quot;may make available to the person&quot;.  Again, I am trying to promote a positive support-based approach to activation rather than one that assumes that citizens must be prodded and poked and reluctantly forced to engage.  That is not my understanding of most citizens.  I believe most people are very keen and some people in the self-employed section who are coming through have shown in the past their eagerness to work and to engage.  That should be our primary assumption in how we speak to them.<\/p><p>Of more specific concern is the phrase in line 42: &quot;attend for or submit to an assessment of that person's education, training or development needs&quot;.  Attending for an assessment of one's educational, training or development needs is one thing.  That is an important and appropriate requirement and it is one that is put on others who engage with the social protection system, but the phrase &quot;submit to&quot; gives rise to concern.  What do we mean by that?  Does it mean that any questionnaire that relates to any aspect of one's development or personal training must be filled in and submitted to?  How do we know, for example, that it is a necessary and proportionate assessment that is taking place?  What recourse is there, if for example, a person finds an assessment to be intrusive or inappropriate?  &quot;Submit to&quot; is dynamic whereby because a person who has contributed in the past to the State, no doubt in all the different ways people contribute, is now being required to submit to whatever may be assessed.  There are real concerns here.<\/p><p>The Minister is aware there are concerns with amendment No. 7.  We will come to them shortly.  That is the reason I want to say explicitly in a new section that: &quot;The signing of a personal progression plan shall not be considered a requirement in terms of&quot; either attendance or submission to assessment.  We know there have been situations, because we have heard of them and we have heard them testified in the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, where people have been told while sitting in a room that they must sign off on a plan that has been written for them, in many cases by private companies contracted by the State, and that they must agree that this is their route for progression, and that this is what they want to do with the rest of their life and the rest of their energy and what they have.  We know there have been issues with the signing of those plans.  We debated it more than two years ago whereby persons were told they needed to sign the plan to show that they had attended for interview.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The fact they were in the room, willing to engage and interested in discussing options was not enough if they did not agree to sign a personal progression plan.  There are personal progression plans from Intreo services and others, but in those cases the personal progression plan is put together in some cases by a private company.  There have been concerns internationally about the practice of a large number of persons emerging with very similar, if not identical, personal progression plans that direct them to particular routes that may not reflect the full range of each person's options.<\/p><p>We also know from the hearings at the social protection committee meeting that in some cases, although not all, the Department, when determining payment to these private companies, considers the signing of personal progression plans one of the clear ways in which a company may claim that it has supported somebody or delivered services to a person.  That should not be the case.  It is an inappropriate financial incentive or pressure to put on a private company in order for it to put pressure on vulnerable persons.  Although the amendments may appear to be technical they are about the ethos of the State and of the engagement.  Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are very important and I hope the Minister might consider taking them on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#FF01300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":199,"content":"<p>With great respect to my good friend, Senator Higgins, who is well motivated on these issues, I cannot see the difficulty with the personal progression plan.  The plan is to establish what the person's position is in respect of education and personal development, in the sense of self-confidence and self-awareness, or where the person is on that ladder, for want of a better term, and to try to work out an empowerment process for the person in terms of education and learning to take the person further.  If the administrators of such a plan were abusing their position and engaging in inappropriate, intrusive questioning or inappropriate activity, the person would have recourse to the courts and the normal constraints of the State.  In other words, they would be subject to the law of the land if it were to come under the heading of some sort of abuse.  One assumes that would seldom happen or is most unlikely to happen, but in the sad event of it happening there would be recourse to the law.  The departmental officials would see it as their duty to interfere and get rid of a private operator who was acting inappropriately.<\/p> <p>The function of such a plan usually would be to establish somebody's aptitudes, skill sets, possibilities for the future and their potential and to help guide them onto that path.  It would be sad if people were just being sent off down a particular avenue.  I doubt that would be the case.  I would have thought, and perhaps the Minister will elucidate this, there would be a supervisory element at senior Civil Service level whereby somebody would be monitoring the nature of these plans or monitoring the operation in a random way.  However, one would assume that anybody who is successfully designated to do this work would have the level of responsibility and circumspection not to abuse that position.  If that person does, the full rigours of the law should be applied.  If they are private contractors, they should immediately lose their contract if they are misappropriating or doing the wrong thing.  I believe a progression plan should be embraced as a good thing, with the person's personal development built on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#GG00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>On the question of personal progression plans, my amendment does not seek to remove them.  When I debated this issue with the Minister in the past I proposed that she set guidelines on personal progression plans.  That would have been a useful step in moving towards the wished-for situation described by Senator O'Reilly.  However, my amendment specifically states that the fact of a person having attended a meeting should not be dependent on having the person sign a piece of paper to say that he or she agrees to a particular progression plan for his or her journey and life.  Under the scheme at present the Minister may move towards a penalty if somebody is construed as having refused to attend a meeting.  The experience of people who have spoken to us is that they have found themselves in a situation where they have been told that unless they sign, a plan they will be regarded as having walked out of the meeting because they did not agree to an agreed conclusion.  My point is simple.  Where somebody attends a meeting and he or she wishes to consider the proposals that are being put forward for his or her progression for the next one, five, ten or 15 years of life - perhaps the person wishes to seek advice on them and examine other options - the fact that the person is not willing to sign the plan at that meeting should not be construed as he or she not having attended the meeting and thereby being subject to penalty.<\/p> <p>On the quality of personal progression plans, it is not for the individual to take a case on this.  Individuals at a meeting such as this may well be living on a payment from week to week and will not be in a position to have recourse to the courts, and certainly not before they might find themselves hungry or without heat.  In that regard, it is up to the State to set standards.  I have spoken to the Minister on this and called for setting standards for personal progression plans.  However, this specific amendment is trying to deal with the situation where an attendance and, therefore, the signalled willingness to engage with the State regarding possible options could be denied.  Somebody's attendance at a meeting should not be denied because he or she has refused to sign off on a plan at that meeting.  It is simply that that their attendance should be registered separate from whether the individual has signed a plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#GG00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Higgins on this.

The fact that somebody attended should be enough.  Trying to force somebody to accept a particular plan at the meeting is an unfair call.  The person needs time to think about it.  In my experience in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, we were very lucky with our adult guidance service.  It was good at fitting people into the niche that suited them best, but that was not true of all the services.

We were at 10% or 14% unemployment; we are now below 5% and still dropping.  We are now dealing with people who, unfortunately, have issues other than unemployment.  That is why we are getting bad press in respect of the system.  I will not be supporting the amendment, but I ask the Minister to look at how we deal with difficult cases in respect of long-term unemployment and how they are dealt with by different agencies and the traditional mechanisms.  Many of the people with whom I am dealing and who have had negative experiences with the support services have many other issues outside of unemployment.  I accept what Senator Higgins is trying to do in respect of the legislation, but I do not believe we are getting to the nub of the issue.  It is about the current legislation, intergenerational unemployment and citizens who have other issues such as addiction to drugs or alcohol, issues with anger management, or a lack of educational opportunities when they were most needed.  We really need to hone our responses to people who have been unemployed in the long term because they are affected by many issues outside of unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#HH00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I note that the Minister is interested in mirroring language.  My next set of amendments speaks to the differences between this legislation and current schemes.  There are parts where the legislation does not mirror the current language.  Is the phrase \"submit to\" used in the current legislation, or is it \"attend for\"?  I would like to tease out that specific issue.  If it is the case that \"submit to\" is used rather than \"attend for\" I will seek to amend that by way of the other legislation.  The circumstances have changed.  This is not simply a like-for-like mirroring of what we previously had because when the previous legislation was put forward, private companies with specific targets and profit motives - and the issue of their role is a separate debate - were not operating in the sector.  That is why an extra layer of clarification with regard to whom the service is serving, the power dynamic and where the emphasis should be with regard to the delivery of services is important.<\/p> <p>Personal progression plans are another specific issue which has changed.  I accept the Minister's point that these changes may need to relate not only to supports for the self-employed, as outlined in this section of the Bill, but more widely.  I may need to table amendments mirroring this in respect of jobseeker's benefit and other similar benefits.  The signing of a plan is related to payment.  The Minister may be able to confirm that but at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection officials from the Department gave the strong impression that the signing of plans has at least some relationship to payment.  If that is the case, there is a concern that people who are commercially motivated may decide they need to get a given number of personal progression plans signed and may put pressure on somebody by threatening to say he or she has not attended or co-operated.  That is an issue.  We know that inappropriate plans are made.  I worked with young, unemployed people in Wexford.  I remember talking to a young girl who had worked breaking horses and in animal training.  She was told that she should do childcare.  She knew that she has the opposite set of skills and that it would not be appropriate for her to do a childcare course and that caring for children would not be appropriate for her.  She felt it was an inappropriate match for her but that if she did not agree to it her payments would be vulnerable.  I know there are many more such instances.<\/p> <p>The Minister is not going to accept these amendments.  It is a wider issue, but a new circumstance.

They are used in every single scheme under which we try to get people work or re-education.  Without a plan, I do not know how one gets from A to B.

The first is the question of mirroring in these new provisions the language we have in existing social welfare legislation insofar as possible and appropriate.  The other issue is the question of helping people and ensuring we are offering a full range of services.  The Minister spoke eloquently on this issue in the past.  I recall when she spoke about people having the opportunity to come back to become physicists, for example.  She spoke about providing educational training and employment options.<\/p><p>The concern, however, is that there is one specific change in the language.  In the previous legislation regarding unemployment benefit and the question of disqualifications, it stated that a person may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit where he or she has received an offer of suitable employment or has, without good cause, refused or failed to avail of any reasonable opportunity of providing or receiving training or has failed or neglected to avail himself or herself of any reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment.  The language in this Bill speaks to an opportunity.  It is singular.  It is different to require somebody to take up some of the panoply of offers or engage in some reasonable opportunity of training.<\/p><p>The section now states, &ldquo;a request is made by or on behalf of the Minister to that person to participate in, agree to participate in or avail himself or herself of an opportunity of participating in any scheme or programme of employment or work experience, or a course of education, training or development, which is prescribed for the purposes of this section&rdquo;.  We are moving from a situation where somebody has to show he or she is willing to engage in any reasonable opportunity of training or form of employment to one where a person declines a scheme or course, where the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; has been removed.  Who considers it appropriate?  It would seem to be the case officer.<\/p><p>The other term that is concerning is &ldquo;prescribed for&rdquo;.  For example, I can say I have prescribed for an individual a specific job in a multinational chain or a specific course.  If the person says &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that specific course or job, then that person is leaving himself or herself vulnerable regarding his or her payments.<\/p><p>My amendments seek to be consistent and ensure reasonableness is a requirement in the wider sense.  They also aim to move away from a climate of prescription of a specific option for persons.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I also ask that we restore the language, which is in other parts of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, whereby it provides for any reasonable opportunity of training or of obtaining suitable employment.

Of course, we must have legislation that assumes everybody acts in the best interests of themselves and others and the State must act in the best interests of the people it serves, but the reality is there are some people who do not and, therefore, the penalty clauses need to be included in case of instances where people do not want to avail of the opportunities without having a good reason to do so.<\/p> <p>The legislation also includes provisions that courses must be appropriate to the development of and the needs of the person.

I am not arguing against their existence or the existence of penalties, rather it is a matter of how it is determined.<\/p> <p>I have tabled amendments proposing the removal of sections because I believe they need to be redrafted to be consistent with the language used in the existing legislation.  That is a fundamental point.  My goal, which I believe should be the main goal, is that persons will be presented with a number of options and as a result they will be able to have a better outcome.  We have heard it in testimony before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection that one of the main problems in terms of educational placings is that people are placed in the wrong course, one that does not suit them or where there are timing and other issues.  I will not go into the education area at length as it is covered in a later amendment.  This is about ensuring we get this right which would save the State money and ensure people progress in a meaningful way at an earlier stage in their lives.<\/p> <p>The Minister spoke about the word \"agreed\".  If the word \"agreed\" was included instead of the word \"prescribed&rdquo;, we would have a very different message.  Perhaps that is an amendment that she or I may wish to put forward on Report Stage.  The word \"agreed\" would be different from the word \"prescribed\" as the latter would be used in the context of the professional telling the person involved.  We do not negotiate or discuss to any great extent, besides what the symptoms may be, what a doctor may prescribe to treat an illness but we do discuss and negotiate what might be an appropriate course of action.  That is where language is important and that is a word that has been added also.  It is a little different.  The phrasing \"any reasonable\" is what should be included.  We can return to this on Report Stage.  These amendments have been tabled in a constructive spirit and I want to ensure there is not a slippage in the language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#KK01100","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins is dogged and has a great eye for tiny detail.

There are issues on which the Minister and I have agreed and made progress together.  However, issues on which we have had many disagreements are in regard to data protection and the public services card.  I raised concerns in June 2017 about the public services card.  In the Social Welfare Bill of that year, I put forward amendments specifically seeking to ensure that the State would be cognisant of and careful in regard to its legal responsibilities in regard to the public services card.  In those debates, we also spoke about the concern as to whether or not people had adequate information in regard to the decisions they were making and in terms of the purposes to which their data would be used.  I spoke at that time not simply because I was concerned about the rights of individuals, but because I was very concerned that the State was acting in a way that left itself open to charges of legal negligence, at the least, it not recklessness.<\/p><p>At that time, I put forward amendments which were basically the same as these amendments Nos. 22 and 23 and have the same principle.  I sought to ensure that no individuals would be required to have a public services card or have their information registered in an associated single customer view dataset in terms of accessing any services they may need.  Amendment No. 22 relates to the accessing of social welfare services and amendment No. 23 relates specifically to other specified bodies.<\/p><p>The concern I expressed at that time has, I think, been vindicated.  It is extremely unfortunate that, even as an investigation was under way - a section 10 investigation into the public services card - the Department consistently went ahead in the active promotion of and pushing of the public services card as a requirement, whether mandatory or compulsory, whichever the phrase may be, for those who are accessing services.  Indeed, just weeks before the original draft report was produced by the Data Protection Commissioner over a year ago, a new contract was signed.<\/p><p>When we look to the report we have, the figures are very striking, with costs of over &euro;60 million and the associated savings estimated at about &euro;2 million, which is very short.  Either way, while the economic argument is very strong and a real concern, there is also a huge concern in regard to the State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At a time when the State had appointed its own arbiter, an independent body which was investigating one of the largest Departments with one of the biggest budgets which most directly affected the lives of citizens in this State, the Department did not pause to consider this contract, or even whether to sign a new one.  It is not just important in the context of the Minister's Department - it is important in the context of Ireland and our international reputation.  We are one of the key data protection regulators in the world and we have a huge international reputation to maintain.  I have been deeply disappointed in some of the ways the response to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which has been doing its job, has been framed.  I do not claim that I was unique in raising concerns in 2017 because many others did, in particular in civil society.  We need to listen when alarm bells are rung because this is a legal process, notwithstanding the fact that the State intends to challenge the findings.  Aside from the actions advised by the Data Protection Commissioner, many individuals are also entitled to take cases if they are not given satisfaction by the State.<\/p><p>While these amendments do not address all the concerns, they would have addressed some of them.  Specifically, amendment No. 23 sought to make it clear that it is not legally appropriate to require somebody to have a public services card to access a specified service.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is one of the many Ministers with specified bodies under their aegis and he made a change to this policy, which I acknowledge.  He listened and showed why listening was important.  We will come to other arguments when the report relating to biometric data is published.  This is another area in which the State needs to review some of the arguments which it has put forward with certainty.  We can expect the outcome of this investigation shortly and I am not confident in any way that the State's arguments will stand up.<\/p><p>My amendment No. 22 gives an opportunity for the Minister to ensure that in this interim period, whether the actions of the Data Protection Commissioner are being delivered or the State is challenging them through legal processes, an individual who wishes to access services from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection should be required to sign up to a public services card.  If somebody has a new child and wants to get child benefit, how can they be expected to add themselves to a database that is potentially facing deletion, with serious concerns having been raised about data protection?  Accepting the amendment would allow the Minister to accept other forms of identification, which would allow her to fulfil the key purpose of satisfying herself as to the identification of persons.<\/p><p>I wish we had paused in 2017, and again in 2018 before a new contract was signed.  However, accepting this amendment gives the Minister the ability to accept alternative forms of identification when the contract expires in January 2019, as well as use other methods to satisfy herself as to a person's identity.  It would allow us to stop digging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#LL03800","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>This is a very worthwhile amendment and quite apt in view of the Data Protection Commissioner's report, which I believe the Minister intends to challenge following advice from the Attorney General's office that this is lawful, despite the Data Protection Commissioner saying it is unlawful.

Concern was expressed over this in finding 3.  Finding 4 states, \"The Data Protection Commission is not satisfied that the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 alone provides data subjects with sufficient information on the PSC and Safe 2 registration, particularly with regard to purposes of processing, to meet DEASP's transparency obligations under section 2D of the Acts.\"  Finding 5 states, \"The Data Protection Commission is not satisfied that DEASP's privacy statement provides data subjects with sufficient information in relation to processing of personal data in connection with the issue of the PSC and Safe 2 registration to meet DEASP's transparency obligations under section 2D of the Acts.\"  Has that privacy statement been changed?  It is a concern.  Will that same privacy statement be the one that applies to persons who are now joining this register and who are getting new public services cards?  I could go on.  There are other amendments.  There is another related amendments and we will have an opportunity to discuss it.<\/p> <p>Let us be clear: there are findings and concerns.  Nonetheless, my amendment simply gave the Minister the space.  I had other amendments ruled out of order because of a potential charge regarding the contract of the State with the private company providing public services cards.  The contract has already been signed and there is a tendering process under way.  My other amendments were more modest because they simply sought a six-month hiatus that would at least allow for these issues to be resolved and ensure that, at least for the six-month period, individuals who wished to access much-needed payments would not have to undergo a process requiring them to accept an inadequate privacy statement and would not find themselves adding to the problems.  In addition to referring to the concerns expressed by the Data Protection Commissioner on the principles of the law, I refer to the fact that there is recourse available to individuals.  I believe the Minister would want to seize the opportunity to ensure new individuals do not have to add themselves inappropriately in terms of the public services card and so she will not continue with a business-as-usual approach despite very serious concerns.<\/p> <p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is an immensely important one and that is why I am proud to be a member of the social protection committee.  I take my role in scrutinising legislation concerning the Department very seriously.  It is a Department of which Deputy Regina Doherty is very proud to be Minister.  While it is an important Department, this issue is much wider than it because it relates to Ireland's credibility regarding international regulation and some of the issues that even the Taoiseach was speaking about very recently, namely, the global digital realities we face.  It will be very hard for Ireland to be seen as a credible regulator of the data processing of some of the largest international corporations in the world if we do not take our own regulation seriously and if we do not show that we are willing to abide by and engage with directions and findings when presented to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#NN00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Never the twain will meet.

It will provide that, in all cases where an appeal is made against a social welfare decision made by an officer of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the appeal will have to be submitted to the Circuit Court.<\/p> <p>The chief appeals officer has discretionary powers under section 307 to certify that the ordinary appeals procedure is inadequate to secure the effective processing of a particular appeal and to the direct the person to submit the appeal to the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court may, on hearing the appeal, either affirm or substitute the decision of the deciding officer in accordance with the Social Welfare Acts.  A key difficulty facing the chief appeals officer in Criminal Assets Bureau cases is that, for very understandable reasons, insufficient information is provided by the bureau to the officer as to why a person's claim is being investigated by the bureau and on the nature of the alleged criminal conduct that the person is facing.  This difficulty is often compounded by the fact that, while information relating to the investigation and the nature of the alleged criminal conduct is recorded on file, it is not evident that the person being investigated is advised as to why his or her claim is being investigated by the bureau and-or the relevant provision of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act that is being relied upon.  If the chief appeals officer were to base his or her consideration on the information, it would be incumbent on him or her to advise the appellant accordingly; however, the chief appeals officer does not enjoy the anonymity afforded to Criminal Assets Bureau officers and, in these circumstances, she or he would be the first person advising the appellant of these facts.  That is clearly undesirable and the amendment will address these difficulties directly.<\/p> <p>In practical terms, the appeals against social welfare decisions made by a bureau officer of the Criminal Assets Bureau will continue to be made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in the first instance and the statutory timeframe for making the appeal will apply but the chief appeals officer will be required to cause a direction to be issued to the appellant directing the person to submit the appeal not later than 21 days from the receipt of the direction of the Circuit Court.  In line with section 307, the Circuit Court may, on hearing the appeal, affirm the decision or substitute the decision of the deciding officer in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act and on the same evidence as would otherwise be available to the appeals officer.  The Criminal Assets Bureau and the Department of Justice and Equality are both supportive of this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#NN01200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions to seek clarification.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the instance where a case is put forward, when a decision is made, and someone wishes to appeal that case, can I clarify that this is a third stage or is it a replacement for the second stage of an appeal?

How does the State recover overpayments?  I raised the issue of self-employed people, particularly sole traders, who laid off staff during the recession or had no choice but to close their businesses because they had failed and were then required to pay redundancy of two weeks per year to all staff.  When a business was unable to make those payments the State stepped in and paid the two weeks' redundancy per year.  This provision operates under the 2003 Act, which was amended to increase the number of weeks of redundancy payments to employees from one week to two weeks per year.  If I recall correctly, the State's decision to amend the legislation in 2003 was a knee-jerk reaction to a company in Waterford, Talk Talk, going bus and laying off between 400 and 500 employees overnight.<\/p> <p>In any event, in this legislation sole traders are being treated completely differently from companies.  A company can fold and the State will carry the can for two weeks' redundancy per year for its employees.  In the case of a sole trader who has been a good employer for maybe 40 or 50 years but was unable to continue in business during the recession and had to close down, the State, as I said, stepped in and paid the two weeks per year when the employer was unable to pay.  Now the State, in a number of instances that I am aware of, is pursuing such people for the return of this money.  It is to be taken from the person's estate if he or she is unable to reach an agreement, presumably with the State.  The person's estate will have to cough up when he or she dies.  This is very serious as the sole trader is being treated differently from companies.  I ask the Minister to examine the amendments made to the 2003 Act.  In effect, the State, in that Act, introduced a retrospective provision requiring sole traders to pay moneys if they go bust or close their business.  In January 2003, a sole trader may have been caught for a redundancy payment of one week per year, whereas in February of that year, a sole trader would have been caught for two weeks per year, possibly going back to the 1960s or 1970s.  This was an awful position to place on sole traders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#OO01900","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>The Senator is referring to legislation introduced long before my time, as I am a new Deputy.

The key electoral reform recommendations in the Manning report were: that the majority of Seanad seats would be elected by popular vote in a one person, one vote system; that this principle would be extended to include Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and those living overseas who hold a valid Irish passport; provision for online registration of voters and downloading of ballot papers; and a greater role for the Seanad in the scrutiny, amendment and initiation of legislation.  A conservative estimate of the electorate under these arrangements is 5.3 million people.<\/p> <p>Since the publication of the Manning report, the Seanad has had a number of opportunities to discuss Seanad reform, including statements on the report in July 2015 and again in June 2016, when Senator McDowell, along with a number of other Members, introduced the Seanad Bill 2016, a Private Members' Bill based on that prepared by the Manning group.  However, it was apparent during the course of those discussions that while we had consensus on the need for change, we still did not have broad consensus on the detail of that change.<\/p> <p>Against that background, and with the agreement of those on all sides, the Seanad reform implementation group was established.  Its main terms of reference were to consider how to implement the recommendations of the Manning report and whether any variations to those recommendations were needed.  The group was also asked to provide the text of a Bill to implement its proposals.  One of the very obvious issues in the report, however, is the lack of consensus among the group.  The report sets out different statements of position from members who had dissenting views.  These range from re-examining the constitutional provisions relating to the Seanad with the aim of achieving more meaningful reform to having an electorate composed only of residents in the State.  Today's statements arise as a result of the Government's consideration of the report and its wish to reflect on the position of the Oireachtas before taking any further steps.  I am here to listen to the views of Senators.<\/p> <p>The implementation group has not proposed any change to the widening of the electorate at Seanad elections from what was recommended in the Manning report.  The proposal to widen the electorate includes extending the franchise at Seanad elections to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and those living overseas who hold valid Irish passports.  The Government is proposing to hold a referendum to extend the franchise to citizens outside the State for presidential elections and the relevant constitutional amendment Bill was published last week.  That referendum could serve as a useful barometer of the views of our existing electorate for extending the franchise in this way.  My view is that we should await the outcome cf that referendum before proceeding with extending the franchise for Seanad elections.<\/p> <p>I will now turn to the variations to the Manning recommendations proposed by the implementation group.  The first of these is a proposed change to the number of Seanad Members that would be elected by the public.  The group now proposes that 34 of the 60 seats shall be directly elected from the five vocational panels, whereas Manning had recommended 36.  The group also proposes that 15 seats be elected from an electoral college of Deputies, outgoing Senators and city and county councillors, two more than the 13 seats recommended in the Manning report.  I am in interested in hearing the views of the House on the vocational panels.  Is changing the numbers to be elected by the public and by elected Members, as proposed, satisfactory or are there more fundamental questions to be asked such as, for example, whether the panel structure is fit for purpose?  Do the proposed reforms of the panel system go far enough?<\/p> <p>I note that the implementation group supports the proposal in the Manning Bill for a single six-seat university constituency, the franchise for which would be extended to other institutions of higher education apart from the National University of Ireland and Dublin University.  This would give effect to the 1979 referendum on that point.  However, I also note with interest that the group did not have a consensus on this proposal.  An alternative proposal was recommended by some members of the group to divide the university constituency into three sub-panels, each of which would elect two Senators.  Again, I am interested in hearing Senators' views.<\/p> <p>The implementation group proposes to depart from Manning concerning the downloading of ballot papers by voters.  This recommendation removes existing doubts regarding the integrity of Seanad elections being compromised by the use of Internet or other technology.  I agree with the implementation group on this point and with the report where it concludes that we should tread carefully in the harnessing of technology in the context of the electoral process, particularly in light of past experience in Ireland and also other issues regarding the integrity of voting systems across the world in more recent years.<\/p> <p>As already stated, under the Manning proposals, a conservative estimate of the number of persons who would be entitled to register and vote in Seanad elections is 5.3 million.  The implementation group does not propose any change to that electorate so we are broadly looking at the same numbers.  There is no doubt about the operational and logistical challenges in dealing with such large numbers of postal ballots and, therefore, careful planning and adequate resources would be needed.<\/p> <p>The implementation group upholds the Manning recommendation that a separate register of Seanad electors should be established and maintained by a new Seanad electoral commission.  However, we estimate that nearly two thirds of those who would be entitled to be on the Seanad register are already on the register of electors maintained by local authorities.  The group puts forward the argument that having a separate register that requires voters to voluntarily apply for inclusion on the Seanad electoral register would mean that the register would largely be populated by those members of the electorate who have demonstrated an interest in participating in Seanad elections.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The group argues that this would reduce costs and limit the potential for voter fraud because there would be fewer unwanted or unused ballot papers in circulation.  The group anticipates that, under these arrangements, rather than there being a rush to register, the growth of the register would take place gradually.<\/p><p>The group further anticipates that the number of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and of those living outside the State likely to exercise their right to register would be much lower than the total number entitled to register.  I am not entirely convinced by that argument.  It is likely that the uptake to register at a Seanad election could be very high among certain groups but would not be representative of the entire State or of Irish citizens living outside the State.  It is important that we design a system of electoral reform that accommodates the full representative electorate rather than some anticipated reduced uptake of registered electors.  I am not convinced that having parallel registers, one for Seanad elections and one for all other elections, is the right approach, particularly in view of the work which is well advanced in my Department to overhaul and modernise the register of electors.  This is a matter that requires careful examination.<\/p><p>The establishment of a Seanad electoral commission was originally proposed as an interim measure pending the establishment of an electoral commission with a broader remit.  Work is well under way in my Department to prepare the general scheme of an electoral commission Bill, which will see a commission up and running sooner than previously thought.  As such, a Seanad electoral commission may not be necessary.<\/p><p>Other Seanad electoral reform proposals need to be teased out more fully.  For example, it is proposed that when applying for inclusion on the register of electors, a voter would choose the constituency in which he or she will vote at Seanad elections.  This could give rise to some constituencies having significantly more voters relative to others and relative to their respective numbers of seats.  The implementation group's Bill does not make any provision for balancing constituencies, so we must consider how that can be achieved in a practical and manageable way.<\/p><p>There is provision in the Bill to place a time limit on the period a person has been resident outside the State in order to qualify to be registered at a Seanad election.  This would effectively limit the overall number of electors based overseas, but it is a proposal that leads to several questions.  For example, what time period would be fair and how would such a criterion operate in practice?  How would we know how long a person has been resident outside the State?  These are issues that merit further consideration.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that reforming the electoral system as proposed will require significant resources.  I welcome the suggestions provided by the implementation group for minimising costs where possible.  They include the use of ordinary post rather than registered or prepaid post and the issuing of combined candidate election literature rather than separate items of literature for each candidate.  However, we must bear in mind that ballot papers and combined election literature would have to be sent to a significantly higher number of electors than currently is the case, which means the associated costs will inevitably be significantly higher than at present.<\/p><p>The Manning report recommends several non-statutory reforms to the way the Seanad conducts its business.  These could be implemented by the Seanad itself at any point, which this House should consider doing at the earliest opportunity.  Examples of such reforms include strengthening of arrangements for Seanad scrutiny of reports from committees dealing with EU matters, facilitating debates on committee reports on EU matters which would be opened and closed by a chairman, rapporteur or member of the relevant committee nominated for that purpose, and regular scheduling of committee reports to improve the effectiveness of the House as well as the level of attention given to its work.  The report adopted the principled objective of developing and strengthening the vocational nature of the Seanad.  However, the report points out that the existing vocational panels are not evident in the way debates are structured in the House.  Greater prominence could be given to the panels by periodically scheduling special debates on broad relevant themes and prioritising Senators elected to the relevant panel when assigning speaking rights in particular debates.<\/p><p>Today's debate provides a welcome opportunity to deepen our consideration of the electoral and non-electoral reforms we want to see.  The Government is committed to implementing the reforms contained in the report but is also seeking views from Members about possibly going further.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the proposals by the implementation group regarding the election of Members of this House and its recommendations for changing the way the Seanad conducts its business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#PP00800","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Since becoming a Senator in 2016, I have learned a lot, seen a lot and thoroughly enjoyed my work in the House.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann has been the subject of no fewer than 14 separate reports on proposed reforms.  It is widely accepted that the Upper House can and should play an effective role in Irish politics.  Irish people voted in 2013 to retain the Seanad and its function of providing checks and balances in our political system.  However, no changes have yet been implemented.<\/p> <p>The report from the implementation group on the 2015 Manning document offers a clear path forward to achieving a reformed and effective Seanad.  It reflects much of what is contained in Fianna F&aacute;il's constructive Bill on Seanad reform, which put forward a series of measures that could be implemented immediately by the Government.  The key word here is \"implement\".  Given the clear appetite for change and our understanding of the need for such change, let us proceed with it.  We should give all citizens a vote and broaden representation for specific minority groups.  We listened to what the wonderful people who took to the streets had to say.  They are asking for listening ears and active hands.  Let us give sports committees, school organisations and minority campaigners a shot at representing those who would vote for them to do so.<\/p> <p>My party was the only one to oppose the proposed abolition of the Seanad in the 2013 referendum.  Since then we have used our three Seanad nominations to facilitate independent voices in the Upper House.  The people of Ireland crave a change in how we do our business in the Oireachtas, but we cannot offer that change without a complete overhaul of the political system.  This is not a party political issue but, rather, a national issue.  It is time for us to insist on Seanad reform and to work together to achieve it.  We, in Fianna F&aacute;il, will work with the implementation group to build a consensus.  We want the Seanad to function as a check on Government power.  It should have a meaningful role in scrutinising national and EU legislation.  We want to see the doors of the House opened to a broader representation of people and groups throughout Ireland who would not be heard in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>Our reform Bill offers an immediate legislative route to achieving those goals and could be implemented in a matter of weeks.  We must not allow the Government to ignore the need for real political reform and let it slip off the agenda.  Our Bill would offer a voice in this House to young Irish people throughout the world.  As citizens of this country, they deserve such a voice no matter where they live.  We propose to introduce votes for eligible Northern Irish citizens, reserve seats for minority groups, achieve greater gender and identity equality, and curb spending on campaigns.  My party is committed to working with the committee to advance the Manning report and our own proposals for reform.  We want to implement the real and tangible change voters throughout the country are seeking.<\/p> <p>There was much talk about a democratic revolution from members of a previous Fine Gael-led Government, but silencing the voices in the Upper House was not the way to achieve it.  Every Member of this Seanad has used the power of this House to debate questions, raise issues, instruct and inform.  In effect, we have tried in recent years to revive the powerful Upper House that existed under the 1922 Free State Constitution.  In 1937, following its brief abolition, a new and reformed Seanad was established under the new Constitution, comprising five panels, namely, agriculture, labour, industry and commerce, national language and culture, and public administration, to reflect the spectrum of Irish life.  The remaining seats were appointed by the Government and via university representation.  The American author, John Jay Chapman, said, \"The world of politics is always 20 years behind the world of thoughts.\"  Irish life has changed since the restoration of a much weakened Seanad in 1937.  If we are to have a meaningful representation of modern Irish life, we must reflect that change by giving representation to the Irish abroad, those in Northern Ireland who are eligible to vote and other voices in our society.<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has pushed forward D&aacute;il reform as the basis for real change in the way we do politics, and we will work with the implementation group to do the same in the Seanad.  We are committed to finding common ground in developing a consensual approach to reforming the Upper House.  The Government should use our proposals and the recommendations of the implementation group as the starting point for genuine reform, not the severely restricted proposals it originally brought forward for broadening university graduate voting rights.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We will also look to meaningful reform of the D&aacute;il and expansion of local government in order to effect change in politics to reflect the real Ireland.

The Seanad needs to be reformed and the sooner, the better.  We should work together to make that change for the good of the people.  Ireland is changing and we need to change too.  It is a new Ireland.  We face many bigger issues such as climate change that seem to affect us all.

Senator Paddy Burke will have his opportunity.  The abolition of the Seanad, as proposed by Deputy Enda Kenny, would have left the Constitution in tatters.  The checks and balances provided for in the Constitution would have ceased to exist.  There are many such checks and balances.  I will not recite them all, but I wish to make clear that this House has many serious functions under the Constitution, not least of which is that its assent must be obtained before the Government surrenders our entitlement to unanimity on any issue in the European Union.  This House has a veto in that regard and not solely in respect of the removal of judges or the President.  The House was designed by former Taoiseach Eamon de Valera to be independent of the Government.  If it was not designed to be independent of the Government, would it be the case that the will of this House in objecting to legislation passed in the D&aacute;il could be overridden after 90 days?  If it was intended that this House be under the thumb of the Government - where, as currently constituted, it has been kept most of the time - that provision would not be necessary.<\/p><p>The House has a great future in bringing to this Legislature voices which would not simply filter up through multi-seat proportional representation geographic constituencies.  I was in Belfast recently with Senator Marshall and I visited at the vacant senate chamber in Stormont.  It is now widely understood in Northern Ireland that it needs a forum along the lines of this House, to which members of civil society would be elected on non-party lines by the electorate generally to represent various interests.  That is desirable to bring forward different points of view and voices that would not otherwise be heard.  Senator Dolan and the university Senators are examples of people who would not, in the ordinary course, find their way up through the geographical mutli-seat constituency system to a single-chamber legislature.  Their voices would be lost.  I refer to people such as Mary Robinson, who proposed in this House that the law on contraception be reformed.  She was told by the then Archbishop of Dublin that she was bringing a curse upon Ireland.  The House was so much under the thumb of the Government at the time that it did not even give her Bill a first reading.  It refused to allow it to be printed.<\/p><p>One does not have to go back to former Senator W.B. Yeats and his speech on how we are no petty people, to Mary Robinson or to the countless other individuals who contributed in the House through the years - and who would not have been in the Oireachtas if we did not have a Seanad - in order to prove that this House is of significant value.  In particular, I wish to mention the late Feargal Quinn who, as a Member of this House, was a great statesman in terms of pursuing various topics and interests of his in the national interest.  It is worthwhile reminding ourselves that his final article for <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>was posthumously published the day after his funeral in Sutton last year.  In the article, he pointed out the shameful way in which Seanad reform was apparently being abandoned to the back burner and put for further discussion or polite listening with no action.  The decision of the public to retain the Seanad was due, in no small way, to Feargal Quinn's immense popularity.  He went around Ireland and stood in town squares and people flocked to him.  He reminded them of the value of the Seanad by his simple decency.<\/p><p>When the proposal of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, was defeated in that referendum, he said the people had given him a wallop.  He badly abased himself by stating, in an effort to win the referendum, that there would be no reform of the Seanad if the people voted to keep it.  That was a shocking statement.  It was designed to bully people into disbelieving the possibility that Seanad &Eacute;ireann was capable of reform and needed to be reformed.  After he had been defeated in the referendum, the then Taoiseach slowly came around to the view that he would reform the Seanad because that was clearly the wish of the people in retaining it.  He established a group under the chairmanship of Maurice Manning to advise him on how the electoral system for the 43 vocational seats in the House could be reformed without recourse to a referendum in order to make it more democratic and take it out of the hands of 220 Members of the Oireachtas and approximately 1,100 county councillors.  Maurice Manning produced the report, which was handed to the Government.  His group took submissions from every party and looked at the subject matter inside out.  It came up with what it had been tasked with doing, namely, establishing reform without another referendum.  What happened next?  Nothing happened until pressure came on in the course of the formation of the Government.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, who insisted that implementation of the Manning report be made an aim of the Government.  It was included in the programme for Government that was adopted and put before the people.  What happened then?  Absolutely nothing.  There was procrastination and delay until I and other Senators put a Private Members' Bill before the House.  At that late stage we were informed that the Government wanted to establish an implementation group to deal with the matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The implementation group worked long and hard.

It was to receive complete indifference from the Government and, finally, for the Taoiseach to stand up in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and give the message that if somebody wanted to do something about this, he would not stand in the way.  That is the present Taoiseach.  As Senator Feargal Quinn pointed out in a posthumous article, the Taoiseach was a person who at one time was an ardent advocate of Seanad reform.  In 2007 when he was an earnest Deputy only three months in office, he issued a press release announcing that he had conducted a survey of nominating bodies which play a key role in Seanad elections.  He suggested: \"This survey exposes the urgent need for Seanad reform\", and went on to suggest that this should be the last time the Seanad is elected in this way.  Those were the words of the young tyro entering into the political domain, but now we see a very different Taoiseach, a man who languidly and disgracefully said that if somebody wants to do something about this, let them do it.  Let somebody propose it in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and he would allow a free vote.  The grace of the man is extraordinary.  He said that in the hope that it would be voted down by people who are hostile to it.  That contrasts dramatically with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill which is driven by the Minister, Deputy Ross.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#RR00700","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Is it Boris Ross or Shane Johnson?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#SS00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The Government bows down in acceptance of the Bill against the muted hostility of its Members in this House, as explained to the media.

I genuinely thought it was a very worthwhile exercise.  There was not unanimity on the report.  I am in favour of reform.  I expressed my own views at the meetings.  To be fair, the secretariat of S&iacute;le de B&uacute;rca and Amanda Reilly deserve our praise, as do the experts who came appeared before us.  We had 13 meetings from May to December, which in many ways replicated the 13 reports that were put before us from 1928 to 2015.  As Senator McDowell said, the Manning report is the bedrock of where we started from again.  I welcome that.  We have all participated in the group.  I know that Senator McDowell articulated in his letter to the Taoiseach that it is not a matter that should be left to the initiative of the unreformed Seanad but on which the will of the people, as expressed through the D&aacute;il, should be ascertained and implemented.  The will of the people was to retain the Seanad.  That is the question that was put to the people.  The follow-on from that is a bit like Groundhog Day; we are here again discussing the matter.  It is a bit like Brexit.  The Senator is right.  Those who want reform do not know what actual reform means and those who want to retain the present situation are steadfast in that.<\/p> <p>To be honest, I am halfway in the middle in that I want to see an element kept, as we proposed in the report, and to see reform as we have outlined as well.  As Senator McDowell is aware, I have serious concerns regarding some of the content of the report.  That is the reason our party put a minority view in, as did the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and Deputy Broughan.  Deputy Broughan made a point in the report which coincides with a view I hold, namely, that the people should have a further say in what happens in terms of reform.  I think Sinn F&eacute;in is of the view that we should have elections to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on the same day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is it time to have a White Paper?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#SS02700","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Oh God.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#TT00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I am not procrastinating because I agree with Senator McDowell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#TT00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Oh God.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#TT00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Those of us who are incumbents at the moment are fortunate and privileged to be here.

Our additional notes at the back of the report relate to constitutional change, the abolition of nominees of the Taoiseach, the holding of Seanad elections on the same day as general elections to the D&aacute;il, the abolition of a requirement of postal votes, the provision of equal gender representation and the provision of representation from traditionally marginalised groups in society.  That said, we believe the recommendations of the report should be implemented as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>Today, for the first time, the Minister of State referred to using the result of the referendum on the extension of voting rights in presidential elections to gauge whether people in this State wish to include people in the North.  People voted for the Good Friday Agreement which provides for citizenship rights for those in the North.  That should be the primary gauge of whether people in the North should be entitled to vote in Seanad elections.<\/p> <p>We will see after this debate whether someone will commit to bringing the Bill forward.  I hope the Government does so within the next six months such that it can be enacted this term.  If not, the Seanad and the Government will be failing to address one of the key objectives of the programme for Government.  It would be embarrassing for a Senator to return to the electorate and refer to Seanad reform on his or her election literature if his or her party stifles these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#UU01000","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>There has been progress as well as disappointments in terms of political reform which falls under the brief of the Minister of State.  Prominent among the disappointments is the failure to hold the promised referendum on the right to vote at 16, particularly when we look to the 16 year olds who are leading the world today.  It is extremely unfortunate that that referendum was not held last June as promised.  There are many other such issues to which I could refer.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach should be present in the House for the discussion of Seanad reform to answer questions and engage with Senators on the issue.  The report we are discussing was specifically requested by the Taoiseach.  It is an initiative he put forward and a promise made in the programme for Government.  He should be here to answer our questions.  I will presently turn to some of the inconsistencies in his statements on this issue, but let us first take a step back and address the question of the mandate that exists.<\/p><p>We are not simply brainstorming possible solutions in pursuit of an ideal form of Seanad reform.  The report was based on a clear mandate with very serious origins.  A majority of those who voted in the 2013 referendum chose to retain and reform the Seanad.  The referendum was not limited to the few members of the public who currently have the opportunity to vote in Seanad elections but, rather, was decided by all of the public.  As the Taoiseach acknowledged, the voters in that referendum did not endorse the<i>status quo<\/i>; they wanted reform.  A previous referendum in 1979 was also incorporated in the report of Maurice Manning and reflected in the legislation brought to the House.  The proposal in the 1979 referendum - which is of the same vintage as the Taoiseach - was approved by 92% of voters.  They created a constitutional imperative for the expansion of the university franchise.  There is a significant mandate for that expansion.  There is a mandate from the 2013 referendum for reform.<\/p><p>The Manning report involves an aggregation of all previous work on the issue, carried out on a cross-party basis.  The programme for Government, for which the Taoiseach has ultimate responsibility and to which the Minister of State must adhere, includes a clear commitment to implement the Manning report rather than discuss it.<\/p><p>This 25th Seanad exists by the grace of the Irish public and has a mandate to reform. On the first day it met, Senator McDowell and I, along with nine other Senators, brought forward a Bill to implement the Manning report.  We were asked by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, not to progress further with the Bill because the Government wished to engage on the issue.  We were explicitly told that such was the commitment of the Government on this issue that the Office of the Taoiseach wished to engage on and lead the process of implementing the Manning report.  In a spirit of good faith, we agreed to engage in a process and form a committee.  Several Senators who are present were members of the committee and sat for many hours on it.  In line with the explicit terms of reference we were given relating to how to implement the Manning report and what small changes, technical or otherwise, might be necessary in order to deliver effective implementation, the committee produced a new Bill.  This is not a Bill put forward by 11 Senators; it is legislation drafted by a committee put together by the Government and which reached cross-party agreement.  We did not reach a consensus; we reached agreement.  I and many others sat in a room and voted on the content of the Bill, sometimes paragraph by paragraph.  There other elements which I would have liked to have included, but I did not win every vote.  Similarly, there are elements which Senator Warfield wished to have included.  However, the committee reached agreement.<\/p><p>There has been much reference to four alternative reports.  To be clear, they are four supplementary documents, one of which puts forward the view of an individual who wants the Seanad to be abolished rather than reformed.  Another addresses additional issues.  The committee took seriously its terms of reference and the content of the programme for Government regarding implementation of the Manning report.  As such, additional ideas for constitutional reform were included under those supplementary annexes in order that they could be considered once the long-overdue and mandated necessary steps emanating from the constitutional imperative delivered in 1979, the referendum in 2013 and the programme for Government had been addressed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This idea that it is ambiguous and impossible is not true.

Where did the estimate come from?  Why is it considered conservative?<\/p> <p>At the end of his speech, the Minister of State acknowledged that it is very much in his control to determine and set the scale of this overseas vote.  Regarding a person with an Irish passport resident outside the State who may be able to vote in this referendum, the definition states it is a person who has been continuously resident outside the State for a period not exceeding that which has been prescribed by the Minister.  It may be five or ten years.  The evidence shown by academic experts is that the uptake of the vote, for example with the Mexican diaspora, was not as large as feared.  Indeed, the provision may be changed by future Ministers.<\/p> <p>It must be clear that this is not an abstract amount involving every person claiming Irish citizenship.  This is an issue which can evolve and be changed.  That is in the legislation and was acknowledged by the Minister of State at the end of his speech.  However, it was not reflected in the beginning of his speech.  We have heard again and again from the Minister of State and the Taoiseach about the millions of people who may suddenly claim a vote.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach stated he decided a Seanad committee should be established.  He also said everyone supports reform but tends to be much less enthusiastic about change.  It is the case that we hear much lipservice paid to reform.  The Government, and Fine Gael specifically, has proved to be extremely unenthusiastic about Seanad change.  The lack of enthusiasm was reflected by the Taoiseach saying that he would not stand in the way of anyone who brought forward legislation on Seanad reform.

It is perfectly obvious that there will be no major intervention on reform from the Government.  It is stated in the second paragraph that the Government supports in full the principles underpinning the recommendations.  It is not agreeing with any of the recommendations, just the principles behind them.  It is very easy to do that and it means the Government is going to do nothing or very little indeed.<\/p> <p>With regard to the university constituency, I have stated many times that if over 1 million voters are put into the university system, the Independent voice will be squashed out by the political parties.

It would be rather stupid.<\/p> <p>I noted with great interest that the Minister of State referred to non-statutory reforms and the possibility of doing a certain amount relating to the business of the House.  His statement was absolutely true.  I ask him to support me in the moves I have made to get rid of Standing Order 41, which prohibits the discussion of any amendment that creates a charge upon the Exchequer.  We could do this without a referendum.  It is in the charge of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and this House to vote as they feel.  There has been a fair amount of classic Sir Humphreyism regarding this matter.  It was referred to the D&aacute;il committee.  Why the name of God should that be the case?  No D&aacute;il committee can lay down the law about the Standing Orders of this House.  It would be an impertinent intrusion that I hope would be strenuously resisted by Senators.

That question must be asked.  Senator McDowell is a great advocate for having an independent Seanad, and the current one is the most diverse I have seen, but there will be campaigning for the popular vote in both Houses.  When a Bill is going through one House or the other, Members will have to deal with the popular vote, so what becomes popular will be the issue of the day.  That will cause problems.  At present, Members of this House are not here on foot of a popular vote and they do not have to face the people on issues, so it is easier for them to make an unpopular decision.<\/p> <p>I see from the Minister of State's speech that the Department has reservations about some issues, and rightly so, not least the cost.  There are many issues with regard to the vote.  A section of the report says that where a person entitled to vote in a Seanad general election or by-election states in writing to the Seanad's returning officer that he or she duly returned the ballot papers and the form of declaration of identity by ordinary post to the Seanad returning officer, and the same do not appear to have been delivered to the Seanad returning officer and that he or she desires duplicate ballot papers to be issued to him or her, the Seanad returning officer, if such statement is received not less than 48 hours before the close of the poll at the election, shall forthwith, or if such statement is received by him or her less than 48 hours before the close of business, may send out another ballot paper by ordinary post to such person at his or her address as stated in the electoral register.

I will take as my starting point Senator Paddy Burke's comment that the current Seanad, in a way that has never previously been the case, is not under the thumb of the Government.  I suspect that depends on how one defines the \"Government\".  I am not sure that historians will necessarily take the view that this Seanad showed itself to be completely independent of the will of the D&aacute;il in significant ways.  The real test of independence is that this would happen from time to time.  Whether it should happen or whether our system should allow that type of conflict with the directly elected Legislature or how such a conflict might be allowed and managed are matters for another day's debate.<\/p> <p>I commend the members of the implementation group on the work they have undertaken.  Senator McDowell, in particular, deserves thanks for chairing the group and the work he did.  The extent of just how tortured the debate on Seanad reform has been is starkly illustrated by the list of 13 previous reports on the issue on page 5 of the report.  It appears that forests have been felled to produce reports on this topic.  Let us hope we are getting to the end of that and towards a day of action.  The 2016 programme for Government stated that the Government would progress Seanad reform and the Manning report as a priority, yet it took 18 months for the Government to establish the group.  It has taken nine months for the report to be subject to debate in this House.  Perhaps there are reasons for those delays of which I am not aware.<\/p> <p>The report contains a number of what might be described as minority reports dissenting from certain conclusions of the report.  Mine is not among them as I did not make a submission so I approach what I will say here with a degree of humility.  I have always been of the view that the changes we need require constitutional change, therefore what I would like to happen would go beyond the remit of the Manning report and the implementation group's report.  I noted with interest the dissent of the Fine Gael Senators, who strongly attacked the report's conclusions.  They talk about meaningful and tangible reform and say it can only be achieved through constitutional change through a referendum.  I do not know if that statement will cause surprise in their party, but the 2016 Fine Gael manifesto said nothing about a new referendum, nor did the programme for Government.  Indeed, the Taoiseach, wrongly in my view, explicitly ruled out a new referendum when he addressed this House in February 2018.  It appears the Fine Gael Senators took it upon themselves to abandon that position.  Fine Gael Deputies did not do so.  The Senators say they agree with the Taoiseach's position on extending the Seanad franchise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am not sure how I would feel about that, but I would have some reservations in so far as what might be proposed would go beyond giving the franchise to the citizens of this State.<\/p><p>The decision to propose a referendum to abolish the Seanad in 2013 was a disastrous, politically immature decision that was based on the premise that the Seanad was not functioning in the way that it should, and it jumped from there to a mere simplistic proposal to abolish it.  The public, by a very slim majority, saw through, dare I say, the lack of sincerity around political reform that lay behind that proposal.  It was a grab for political popularity cloaked in the guise of an attempt at political reform, when what was really needed was reform both in how the Members of the Seanad are elected and how it functions.  Of course, that was not on offer on that occasion.<\/p><p>It was said at least once in the time afterwards that the referendum had happened and there could be no further in-depth reform of the Seanad or there could be no recourse to a referendum.  It seemed to me that showed a real lack of engagement with the need to reform how Members are elected to the Seanad and how the Seanad functions.<\/p><p>The public, having given their decision that there must continue to be a Seanad, in much the same way that the public in Britain have given their decision in favour of Brexit, just as the question should now be what type of Brexit, extreme or minor, by the same logic the question is what type of Seanad do citizens want in light of the fact that they have voted to keep it.  I do not think it is correct to curtail the public's options by saying that whatever way it is going to be reformed, it must be reformed within the existing constitutional framework.  While some might accuse Senator Paddy Burke of advancing the type of arguments against the type of reform favoured by Senator McDowell as somehow wanting to perpetuate a system that involves a relationship with councillors of a particular type and so on, the issues that Senator Burke is bringing to the surface do arise once it is decided that reform of the composition of the Seanad and the election of Members can be done only within the existing constitutional framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#XX02000","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#YY00200","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>In other areas the Government has said that it wants to change the law and change things significantly, has sought the permission of the public in a referendum, and at the time has modelled what it proposes to do.  It does not seem to be unreasonable that the Government, however one defines it in the current reality, would get together its preferred choice of Seanad reform and would make the necessary constitutional and legislative proposals that would bring that about .  That would address the complications of having to put all of our citizens in as voters for one vocational panel or another or for having to implement a postal vote or all of the issues that have been touched on today.<\/p> <p>I regret that neither the Manning report nor the report of the Seanad Reform Implementation Group, which was constrained in what it could do, gave more consideration to a more fundamental reform of how we elect the 43 Members to the panel seats.  I would go further and say even the 49 seats, if the university seats are counted, and perhaps even the full 60 seats, if the Taoiseach's nominees are counted.  I told the Minister previously during a debate on the proposed electoral commission that we need to look into the possibility of a list system in Ireland or, more specifically, what is called an open list system.  Reform of the Seanad would give us an opportunity to introduce such a system in a limited way.  I have always been of the view that while one of the great strengths of our system of electing Deputies is that it allows great engagement between candidates and the local voter, that is also its great weakness, because in our system, people do not always vote for ideas because they vote for people.  We have spoken a lot about the clientelism that has bedevilled Irish politics.  Were we to show some kind of curiosity about how we can improve our electoral system, it seems obvious that we would look to see whether a list system could be used to elect most Senators, if not all the Seanad, so that we could begin to have some kind of a balance between the exigencies of getting elected locally, which involves one skill set, and the possibility of electing people on the basis of ideas, where the primary focus would be the panel on which they run.<\/p> <p>One has only to look at the types of politicians who get elected in other jurisdictions where they have a list system to see that there are very different patterns and, I would say, to a large extent, a greater diversity.  Having said that I was in an airport recently when I heard a German MEP tearing strips off a hapless Aer Lingus official about the fact that she was not willing to accept his diplomatic passport.  He said that it was a disgrace, that he had had the diplomatic passport for 30 years, that he had the telephone number of the Irish Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar, and that he wondered whether he should call him.  I realised that it was not just because of their virtue that Irish politicians would not do such a thing but because they are not elected on a list system and they would be conscious that there would surely be somebody from Ahascragh or Celbridge listening to them, even if they were boarding a flight in Hong Kong, and they could do themselves some electoral damage.  The list system does allow certain problems to come into it, such as a certain sense of entitlement and disconnection, but I believe the open list system would allow voters to vote for particular candidates within a party list while voting for their preferred list.  This would preserve the right of voters to vote for their preferred candidates while also ensuring a purer form of proportional representation, with all parties, particularly smaller parties, represented proportionately.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins and others might be interested to note that the international academic evidence shows that list systems lead to 7% more women on average being elected.  Open list PR is in operation in various forms in Austria, Belgium, Croatia and the Czech Republic.  Most importantly, the open list system limits the ability of political parties to rig their candidate list in favour of favoured insiders, and it strongly protects the representation of smaller parties and minority viewpoints.  The open list system achieves greater diversity among groups that get representation and provides the possibility of changing the position in the list so that it is not an elite group proposed by party head office.  I believe this would ensure a much greater openness in how the Members of the Seanad are elected, and that is our ultimate aim, which I think is shared by most people.  I see no reason that such a system could not be implemented within the current panel system and constitutional framework.<\/p> <p>I wish to comment briefly on the representation of the university panels.  Of course, I support the broadening of the franchise to all graduates.  This could have been done by an Act of the Oireachtas any time in the past 40 years.  I do not agree that there should be a number of small constituencies.  I would certainly prefer a six-seat national constituency, but if I am honest, over the years that I have been canvassing votes, I have found myself having to apologise for the fact that university graduates get to elect Senators and non-university graduates, such as my own parents, do not.  I do not think we can stand over that anymore.  We know the origin of the university seats, and Senator McDowell's grandfather distinguished himself in political life as an NUI Deputy, if I am not mistaken, and latterly as a Senator, if my memory serves me well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#YY00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#YY00400","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":543,"content":"<p>A man from my own neck of the woods, Michael Tierney, was a very eminent Senator.

There is very big leap between the proposal to grant a vote to these citizens in presidential elections - it is a largely ceremonial office - and granting them a vote in a direct election to a law-making Chamber.  Citizens abroad who do not pay tax and have any day-to-day input into Irish society should not be given such large influence.<\/p><p>I accept that if we were to move away from the university franchise, there should be some means of allowing Irish people abroad to continue to have a voice but this should probably be achieved other than through the direct election of Senators in the way that the rest of the population at home engage in same.

I welcome the Minister of State.  The more I hear people say they are all in favour of Seanad reform, the more it reminds me of something Pierrepoint, our hangman, is supposed to have said to one of the subjects, which was: \"Son, I am here to help\".  I do not believe people when they say that 13 or 14 reports later.  We could do things in this House tomorrow morning that would show we are reformative.<\/p> <p>I refer to the issue of cost and whether we believe the House has a valued role.  That is looking not only at its cost but at its value.  What is the opportunity cost of having the House?  We saw posters saying the House cost &euro;20 million, trying to frighten people into not supporting the retention of the Seanad.  If cost is the only issue, let us agree to disagree on areas of reform and put forward a menu that we will all accept and then sit down with the smart people, maybe in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who seem to know an awful lot about cutting cloth to measure, and work out a cost.  Why would one let a technical issue stop one from discussing the principal issue?  That bothers me.<\/p> <p>In 2003, the organisation I am also employed by, namely, the Disability Federation of Ireland, put pen to paper and made a submission to one of those reviews.

I refer to the point, which I believe Senator McDowell made earlier, or which was in the report, that there is room for debates and statements around the activities of the nominating bodies.  Some 43 Senators, or two thirds of the Seanad, are elected through vocational panels.

I could see the mastery of himself, Mr. Whelan and others.  On the last occasion I met Mr. Whelan, I had invited him in here - I mentioned this on the Order of Business the morning he passed away - to speak to the nominating bodies to the public administration panel.  He was entertaining.  He said he would cut it down and be very crisp.  He used the analogy that, in 1989, if someone had suggested that we get rid of the other House of the Oireachtas, An tUachtar&aacute;nacht, the President, it might have got legs or have taken off.  He asked if anyone would dare even suggest it now.  Why not?  Has the Constitution been changed?

The knowledge and experience of those who represent the vocational sphere is important.  If the House was divided down the middle and there were people with previous experience in the Oireachtas and Taoiseach's nominees on one side and individuals with knowledge of and experience of those five areas on the other - never mind reforming them for a moment - it would be possible to have fantastic debates about what needs to be done.  This is because there are people in the House who have knowledge of and connections relating to civil society, labour, industry, agriculture, etc.  We could fix many issues and provide involve large numbers on committees.  The value added would be fascinating.<\/p><p>We put a great deal of stock in democratic elections - a matter about which Senator Mullen spoke so well - and electing those who are absolutely attuned to the real issues people face.  Seanad elections are, under the Constitution, absolutely and umbilically connected to D&aacute;il elections.  If one asks people if they know how individuals are elected to the Seanad, one will find they do not have a clue.  A person is the loneliest man or woman in the country when trying to get elected to this House.  People just do not know what we do to get here.  I ask people to reflect on the fact that the election relating to this House is similar to what one might expect to happen when seeking admission to a secret society.<\/p><p>There is much more to be said.  I have enjoyed and learned from the contributions I have heard.  We can be reformative in the way we behave in the House.  I have made some suggestions in that regard and on how the next Taoiseach would deal with the question of his or her nominees.

I got a bit lost in the heat of the moment.  A quote was read out by Senator McDowell.  I felt that there was a certain motive being attributed which I did not believe was accurate, hence my comment.  I should not have said it.<\/p> <p>I thank those who have contributed.  As usual in most debates, whether in this House or the other House, there are plenty of contradictions.  Several Senators have spoken about the delay in acting on the Manning report.  I had only been a Minister of State for a few weeks when I met Senator McDowell and other Senators to discuss the establishment of the group.  Previous occupants of the role will have to answer for why action was or was not taken.  From the date of my appointment, the Taoiseach made it clear that reform of the Seanad was something he wished to act upon and it was hoped that there would be some clarity brought to that by the group headed by Senator McDowell.  As was evidenced in the report we are discussing and in other reports produced over the years, there are all sorts of different views as to the shape of reform.<\/p> <p>Like others, I am struck by the similarities between what we are discussing and the referendum held in Britain on membership of the European Union.  Everybody has an interpretation of what the result in 2013 meant.  I voted against the abolition of the Seanad at that time.  I thought it would have been grossly hypocritical for somebody who had been a Senator for years to vote to abolish it.  I favour reform and different aspects of what various Senators have said during this debate.<\/p> <p>I want to deal with a few issues specifically.  Senator Murnane O'Connor championed a lot of slogans such as \"We need reform.  We need it now.\"  I expected a small protest with placards around St. Stephen's Green.  She provided no proposal in any shape or form for what that reform might be and there was no agreement with the group, other than to say that they were great people.  She did not state what function or reformed role the Seanad might have.  She also launched a bizarre attack on de Valera when she referenced the Free State Seanad, more or less condemning him for its dissolution and the establishment of the reformed Seanad in 1937.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell gave, as usual, a very interesting contribution riven with contradictions.  He quite correctly mentioned many Senators who have served in this House.  He spoke at length about how Mr. de Valera's intention was to design a Seanad which was independent of Government.  In his main contribution, which referred to former Senator Mary Robinson's contraception Bill, he said that that Seanad was so controlled by the Government that the Bill did not even pass First Stage.  He spoke about procrastination and delay, which I have addressed.<\/p> <p>From what I have heard here and elsewhere, nobody has disagreed with the role of the Seanad in giving a voice to those who would not come through our electoral system for the D&aacute;il.  Senator McDowell provided different examples of that.  He managed to explain the unique position that the Seanad occupies.  It was established, he said, to be completely independent of Government, yet over the years it has not been as independent as it could be.  Senator Paddy Burke is correct.  This Seanad and that which sat in the period 1995 to 1997 were probably the most independent of Government because the Governments concerned did not have a majority in the D&aacute;il or in Seanad.<\/p> <p>I reassure Senator McDowell that I wrote to the Clerks of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il regarding a debate on Seanad reform.  The Government does not control the business of the Lower House.  The response from the Seanad came fairly quickly.  I will continue to seek that a debate be held in the D&aacute;il.  The Senator is right to ask that the D&aacute;il give its view quickly.  The Government does not disagree with the suggestion that the D&aacute;il needs to be central to whatever reform takes place in the Seanad.  Insofar as I can, I will push to ensure that the D&aacute;il engages in a debate on the report as soon as possible and, subsequently, any legislation that may follow on from it.<\/p> <p>Senator Warfield spoke about how the matter should be put to the D&aacute;il.  I reiterate that all groups in the D&aacute;il have Members who sit on the Business Committee.  The Government does not have a majority.  As usual, people in here often express views which are very different from what their political party said in the D&aacute;il, which is certainly the case for Senator Warfield.  I am not aware that Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies on the Business Committee have ever expressed a view in the D&aacute;il that a debate on Seanad reform should be held there.<\/p> <p>The Senator stated that he felt he had been mugged when he heard that it cost a lot to produce the report.  I am not sure it cost a lot.  I do not know what the costs were.  He said the names of the panels do not matter.  Nobody suggested that they did.  If one is electing to anything, whether it is the county council in Kilkenny or one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the most important criterion is the electorate.  There have been reform Bills and rotten boroughs.  Some of the Seanad panels in 2019 may be referred to by some, but not me, as variation of a rotten borough .  How one defines who is entitled to vote is central.  It is a significant shortcoming in the report that we are left with no clear path.<\/p> <p>I do not want to misquote what is in the report, which I read earlier.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Point 6.10, which I think an extraordinary statement, is as follows: &ldquo;It is anticipated that the number of Irish resident voters which will both apply to be registered and vote at a Seanad general election will be far lower than the number of persons who tend to participate in D&aacute;il elections&rdquo;.  I know evidence was heard and some of the people are named in the report as having given evidence.  To my mind, having observed elections for years, when one reads that statement, a lot is being taken at face value without thorough investigation.  We cannot, surely, design an electoral system where we are saying, on the one hand, it will reform the way Seanad &Eacute;ireann is elected but, on the other, behind the backs of our hands, we are saying, \"Sure, they will not vote anyway.\"  That is not the way a local authority, a national parliament or the European Parliament would run its electoral system, that is, on the basis that people will not bother to apply.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins raised the 5.3 million figure.  Based on the options paper published in the context of extending the franchise in the presidential election, there are 3.2 million people eligible on the D&aacute;il register at present, 1.2 million people who would be eligible in Northern Ireland and just under approximately 900,000 Irish passport holders abroad, which is where the 5.3 million figure comes from.  I believe in the idea of giving our diaspora a say in elections in this country.  Equally, however, I understand the concerns.  Ten of my father's aunts and uncles emigrated to Illinois and I have many second cousins who have never set foot in Ireland but who have Irish passports.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen raised the issue and it is a legitimate concern.  That is why Senator Higgins pointed to what is contained in the Bill, namely, the Minister can curtail or sign off on regulations to limit this.  However, there is the issue of getting a fail-safe way of clarifying how long a person is living overseas, and perhaps people can self-declare, sign an affidavit or produce some documentation as to place of address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#AAA00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>We do that currently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#BBB00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>However, there has not been much discussion on this in the House tonight and it leaves this wide open to abuse.

We will be embarking on this at the end of this year and we have just had a public consultation on changing the registration process and moving towards a system of using PPS numbers because our existing electoral registers are not exactly as they should be.  That is because local authorities do not have rate collectors and the level of knowledge on the ground is not as detailed as it previously was.  I see in that loose language a recipe for the potential to abuse the franchise.  In that format, it is not something I would be happy to stand over.<\/p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke expressed his concerns about the security of the ballot and the costings.  How we put a value on democracy is a fair question, as others also said, in particular Senator Dolan.  The absence of definitive figures is a drawback of the report.  That is not to say it should be the end of things, and I do not believe that further analysis of those figures could not give an approximation of what would actually be yielded if the report and the attached Bill were implemented.<\/p> <p>Senator Norris asked about Standing Orders in the House.  I have no issue with the reform of Standing Order 41 and the points he made in that regard are valid.  On what the Leader said earlier on the questioning of Ministers, it always struck me as strange that, in some respects, the Seanad is ahead of the other House in that, on the Order of Business in this House, there is the freedom to raise what is topical.  The only problem is that it is being raised with the Leader, who is not necessarily in a position to give a detailed answer.  I know Commencement matters are chosen every day but, certainly, the possibility of having a Seanad where Ministers are questioned more often and in depth by Senators is something I would greatly support.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen made a big thing of the 18 months for the Government.  A new Government was formed when Deputy Leo Varadkar became Taoiseach and, within weeks of that, this group was established.  The Senator spoke about the Seanad referendum being a grab for political opportunity.  I have already stated I did not support it at the ballot box or in other places before that.  Interestingly, the Senator also spoke about his opposition to vocational panels and university panels.  My view is that we have to try to strike a balance.  I am conscious of why the original Seanad was established, namely, to give representation to those alternative voices that Senator McDowell spoke about.  The alternative voices now are very different, although they might still be people of minority religious beliefs.  Actually, Senator Mullen is now an alternative voice, and whether one agrees with him or not, he is saying something that is not always on the side of the political commentariat that exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#BBB00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>He is an alternative voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019092400002#BBB00400","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1569331800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Yes.
