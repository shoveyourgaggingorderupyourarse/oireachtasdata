This is a new &euro;60m business assistance scheme.  The aim of this scheme is to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes such as CRSS and is designed to help with fixed costs.

The intention behind this provision is to assist businesses operating from fixed premises to meet some of the ongoing fixed costs of maintaining those premises.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the eligibility requirement of &euro;50,000 turnover.  It is important to remember that this scheme has been introduced to meet the unavoidable costs that businesses operating from a fixed premises incur whether they are open or not.  Analysis carried out for similar schemes has shown us that where annual turnover is less than &euro;50,000, then it is likely that most costs will be payroll based.  As you know, Government already provides subsidies or other income supports in the form of the EWSS and the PUP.  <\/p>  <p>  While there will undoubtedly be exceptions, it is probable that at these lower levels of turnover, the ongoing costs will generally not impact on the business&rsquo;s potential to re-open as and when restrictions ease.<\/p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so.

I welcome the adoption by the Judicial Council on the 6th March of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines. The Minister for Justice intends that the new Guidelines will apply to all cases that have not yet been assessed by PIAB. This approach will ensure that the law is robust and the Guidelines can take effect as soon as possible as we seek to reduce the cost of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  While I appreciate the points raised in the correspondence received with this PQ, the new Guidelines clearly represent a shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded and in the level of those damages. Awards across all ranges and in all courts should be less than heretofore, with the exception of awards for the most serious types of injury and catastrophic injury. In addition, the Guidelines will apply to all cases that have not yet been assessed by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. This should facilitate an increased level of consistency in awards, more frequent early resolution of claims, and ultimately a reduction in award levels. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Capping of Personal Injury levels considered that a scheme under which general damages are capped and all awards for lesser injuries are indexed to the cap would be constitutional. However, it concluded that it would be appropriate that the Personal Injuries Guidelines be given some time to be applied in practice.  As per Action 15 of the &lsquo;Action Plan for Insurance Reform&rsquo;, Minister McEntee will make a report on the implementation and initial impact of the Guidelines by the end of 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  I would point out that there is no silver bullet to deal with insurance costs. That is why Government developed the &lsquo;Action Plan for Insurance Reform&rsquo; with 66 actions to drive reform across Government. While the Guidelines are important, they represent only one part of our plan.

Through Enterprise Ireland, my Department provides assistance to entrepreneurs and start-up companies to help with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance. Programmes and initiatives include:<\/p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s New Frontiers Development Programme, the national entrepreneur development programme for early stage start-ups. This programme runs in partnership with Institutes of Technology throughout the country.  In 2020, EI supported 157 entrepreneurs across the country on this programme.<\/p>  <p>  - A Competitive Start Fund to support start-up companies to reach key technical and commercial milestones. In 2020, Enterprise Ireland approved 45 new early stage businesses with investments of up to &euro;50,000 each through a series of Competitive Start Fund calls. <\/p>  <p>  - Support for High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) companies with the potential to develop an innovative product or service for sale in international markets and the potential to create 10 jobs and &euro;1m in sales within 3 to 4 years of starting up.

Each Regional Committee is chaired by a senior figure from industry within the region.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to ensure diversity in programme delivery which is addressing the needs and challenges of under-represented cohorts. In that regard, Enterprise Ireland has been working for over a decade to address the deficit in female entrepreneurship.

The majority of these chargers have been rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme, with some public chargers being provided by local authorities, retail outlets and private companies. There are currently 160 charge points and 15 fast chargers in Co Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Fund (CAF) has also allocated up to &euro;10 million to a project from ESB eCars that will further enhance its current network and complete a nationwide EV charging network capable of facilitating large-scale electric vehicle uptake over the next decade. In addition to the CAF project, the Government is also providing support for home charging and on-street charging.<\/p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally-friendly means of charging, especially when using night-rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger, up to a maximum of &euro;600. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, work is being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks). There are a number of complex planning issues to address before it will be possible to finalise operation of such a grant and the Department and the SEAI are working to address the issues involved. <\/p>  <p>  Since September 2019, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place to provide funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate those owners of EVs who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets to charge their EVs near their homes.  Infrastructure installed could also provide the opportunity for people visiting the area to park and charge their EVs. <\/p>  <p>  While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support.  I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at 33 Tesco locations around the country in the last number of months. More than 50 of these are planned in total. The Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the SEAI to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the four Dublin local authorities are currently examining their approach for a network of charging infrastructure in the metropolitan area. The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand.

With the current Level 5 restrictions, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's Level 5 guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has significantly reduced the demand for public transport.  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so. For the duration of current Level 5 restrictions, public transport services are for essential workers and essential journeys only.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most and in particular frontline workers.<\/p>  <p>  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licensed bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.<\/p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  As is the case in many other sectors of the economy, despite these Government supports, Covid-19 has resulted in significant financial pressures for public transport operators.  As you will be aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway business operates on a commercial basis in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.  Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020.  This was a commercial decision by the company.  The decision affects four routes:  the Dublin\/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020): and services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway routes.  <\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement public service obligation (PSO) service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfiguring to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Expressway ceased its X12 Limerick\/Dublin route with effect from Saturday 30 January 2021.  In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X12 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X12 corridor and has determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route. <\/p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply.

For example, the interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.67% in December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages such as:- <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks;<\/p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater benefits for borrowers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100065#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100065#WRC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[13730\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100065#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will request the banking industry to offer an extension of time to those who have received mortgage approval in principle but where as a result of the current restrictions, the offers are not being progressed or withdrawn; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I have maintained contact with the BPFI and lenders on the measures they have put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by COVID-19.  In relation to new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were impacted by COVID-19 on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of extending the period of a mortgage 'approval in principle', the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an 'approval in principle'. That is a commercial and business matter for individual lenders.  However, the Central Bank advises that when a lender offers a mortgage to a consumer, the Consumer Protection Code provides that the lender must include the length of time for which the mortgage offer is valid in the offer document. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the status of their mortgage application or a mortgage 'approval-in-principle' they should, in the first instance, contact their lender directly on the matter. <\/p>  <p>  More generally it should be noted that there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100065#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100065#WRC02700"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[13731\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100065#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the remedies available to those who have been refused mortgage protection insurance (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, while I have taken note of the situation as set out in the details supplied by the Deputy, it is not appropriate for me to comment on specific cases. Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct such companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU's Solvency II framework. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance firms as to their business activities, including requesting them to provide cover to such individuals. <\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making individual-level decisions on whether to offer life insurance, including mortgage protection insurance, and what terms to apply. These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers use different combinations of rating factors. Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with specific firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  Having said the above, I am aware of reports of some customers experiencing issues in obtaining mortgage protection cover as a result of having higher risk conditions particular in the context of COVID-19.  The Deputy will be aware that both I and Minister of State Fleming have consistently stated that in the context of COVID-19 we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. Accordingly, the Government will continue to engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to, and works to protect its customers needs. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  My officials recently contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers, on the issue of mortgage protection insurance. It stated that while most customers are still able to get life; critical illness; or mortgage protection insurance at this challenging time it is aware of a small number of individual cases where a final decision on some applications is being postponed for a period where applicants have a COVID-19-related health condition. However, it stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions are taken into account by the underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19.

The Government's response to the impact of the pandemic on the sector and the economy generally is comprised of a broad range of supports delivered across a range of Departments.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme  and the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme form the principle elements of the Government's response.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced the COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme (CBAS) as a further horizontal support across all sectors of the economy.  SMEs and Businesses in the non-funded live entertainment sector are eligible to apply under this scheme.  <\/p><p>This week I was pleased to announce a new &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support those in the Live Entertainment Sector. As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;25 million is being made available under the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021.  This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences.  <\/p><p>The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. The Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 will be open for applications on 19<sup><\/sup>March 2021 and further information can be found on my Department's website. <\/p><p>An allocation of &euro;5 million has be made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.  <\/p><p>As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for a new scheme to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:<\/p><p>- &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;<\/p><p>- &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000. <\/p><p>Under the scheme, musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers -  whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. The scheme will open when the necessary administrative and IT systems are in place.<\/p><p>&euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector. This will be applied to supporting the installation of high quality recording and streaming facilities in venues through a competitive grant application process. <\/p><p>Additionally, up to &euro;1 million has been allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming to support the employment of performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff.

Development education contributes to an active Irish public, engaged and well-informed on issues which impact on global dynamics with an emphasis on understanding inequalities and interdependencies, including raising awareness of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. <\/p>  <p>My Department&rsquo;s current approach is governed by the Irish Aid Development Education Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2023.  This year, the Irish Aid budget for development education is &euro;5.29 million, which is available to both formal and non-formal education sectors, including schools and schools networks, third level institutions, non-governmental organisations, youth, adult and community groups. Organisations funded are typically members of the Irish Development Education Association, which has produced a Code of Good Practice for Development Education available on its website, www.ideaonline.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the changes in the general education environment over the past year due to the pandemic, in particular the move to digital education, I decided that it would be appropriate to revisit the current Irish Aid Development Education Strategy.  On 15 February, I launched a consultation process for a new strategy, which would address development education and global citizenship.  That consultation is ongoing, with a view to identify new opportunities for engagement, looking to see how lifelong learning concepts might be most effectively integrated into our approaches and, importantly, how we engage with new audiences around the country.<\/p>  <p>  The new strategy will build on strong foundations.  In 2019-2020, Irish Aid supported 31 partners to deliver development education projects, reaching more than 350,000 people.  This includes 70% of second-level schools. 23 of the 26 Higher Education Institutes are providing Irish Aid supported global citizenship courses and other initiatives. In addition, the Department provided grant funding to NGOs and other groups for activities to promote understanding of an engagement with global issues. <\/p>  <p>  The Development Assistance Committee of the OECD reviewed the Irish Aid programme last year, finding Ireland to have a strong approach to development education, focusing on achieving greater knowledge and changed attitudes. The review states that Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;approach encompasses both formal and non-formal education and relies on strong partnerships among the government, non-governmental organisations, education actors and local communities. Outreach to schools is already very substantial, and Ireland is aiming to reach wider audiences to sustain and deepen the considerable support within the Irish population.&rdquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100067#WRE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100067#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[13805\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100067#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of his recent visit to Iran; the position regarding the 2015 Iran nuclear deal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>I visited Tehran on 7 March, and met with the President of Iran, Dr. Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister, Dr. Javad Zarif.The visit took place in the context of Ireland's role on the Security Council as Facilitator for Security Council Resolution 2231.

The grant was previously funded by the Department of Education up to the 2012\/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021.

While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme.

Enrolments to individual schools are a matter for each board of management. It should also be noted that the majority of special schools cater for students up to the age of 18.<\/p><p>However, the NCSE, through its local network of SENOs (Special Educational Needs Organiser), offers advice and support to parents of students that are due to transition to post primary school on the possible placement options available to their child, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement and special school placement.<\/p><p>All post primary placements are supported with additional resources where required for those students with special educational needs.<\/p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.  A network of 29 special classes operate in Cork City currently to provide students with places where complex needs are identified in professional reports and are accompanied by a recommendation for a special class placement.  <\/p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. The NCSE provides a programme of teacher professional learning and in-school support to support schools in establishing special classes.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  For September 2021, the NCSE is aware of a specific identified need for special school placements in Cork City and County and is working with my Department and the education partners towards meeting that need.  <\/p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis.

All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when a teacher suffers from more than one health condition.  The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  A teacher is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.

This may include re-assignment of a teacher to other duties within the school or facilitated to work remotely i.e. working from home.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. <\/p><p>The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.  <\/p><p>At the end of January, there were 89,092 recipients of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure for the payment in 2021 is in the region of &euro;953 million. <\/p><p>The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.<\/p><p>By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week (which will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021).  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.<\/p><p>The ESRI SWITCH microsimulation model has been used for the purposes of the estimate requested.  The additional cost of increasing the means test threshold for entitlement to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance for single and couple cohabiting applicants separately in &euro;50 intervals, up to &euro;450 for single applicants and &euro;950 for couple cohabiting applicants per week are set out in tabular form below.  The final interval in each case is less than &euro;50 in order to arrive at the upper limits of &euro;450 and &euro;950 requested by the Deputy.  It should be noted that the additional estimated costs provided are based on existing recipient data contained in the model.  <\/p><p>It is not possible to give the estimated increase in the number of persons entitled to the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if the means test thresholds were increased.  This is primarily because it is not known how many people there are caring and working that are currently over the income limit but who could apply for\/become eligible for Carer's Allowance if the income limits were higher. Furthermore, SWITCH cannot model behavioural responses in such cases.  <\/p><p>Based on the Department's own analysis of the Carer's Allowance, it should be noted that some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.  <\/p><p>Any changes to the means test must be considered in an overall budgetary context.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Carer's Allowance Single Person Disregard Increase from &euro;332.50 to &euro;450.00 in increments of &euro;50.00<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Single Person Disregard<\/th>       <th>Increase<\/th>       <th>Cumulative Increase from Existing Disregard<\/th>       <th>Estimated Additional Cost (&euro;M) from the current disregard<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;382.50<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;2.33<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;432.50<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;100.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;3.26<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;450.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;17.50<\/td>       <td>&euro;117.50<\/td>       <td>&euro;3.26<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>Table 2: Carer's Allowance Couples Disregard Increase from &euro;665.00 to &euro;950.00 in increments of &euro;50.00<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Couples Disregard<\/th>       <th>Increase <\/th>       <th>Cumulative Increase from Existing Disregard<\/th>       <th>Estimated Additional Cost (&euro;M) from the current disregard<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;715.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;1.50<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;765.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;100.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;2.33<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;815.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;150.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;2.94<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;865.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;200.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;3.26<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;915.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;50.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;250.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;3.26<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;950.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;35.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;285.00<\/td>       <td>&euro;3.81<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100069#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100069#WRG03600"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[13680\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100069#WRG03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the provisions for seasonal workers (details supplied) who are ineligible for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance who worked in the tourism industry for a number of years and had not commenced their seasonal employment when Covid-19 lockdowns commenced.","asker":"1581","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a statutory scheme to support employees who have lost their employment due to COVID-19.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and\/or Allowance, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  In Budget 2021 I was delighted to announce an increase to the Carers Support Grant by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.  This will benefit over 130,000 carers.  Carers in receipt of an increase for a qualified child on their claim will also benefit from the Budget 2021 announced increase to the qualified child rate, by &euro;5 in the case of a child aged 12 or over and by &euro;2 for a child aged up to 12.<\/p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his\/her qualified spouse \/ civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren). <\/p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s\/he can keep his\/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S\/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s\/he cares for more than one person.  It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s\/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s\/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. <\/p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 18.5 hours a week.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving Fuel Allowance, to include Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as a qualifying payment, would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100069#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100069#WRG04200"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[13714\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100069#WRG04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons from Cork city and county who have availed of the pandemic unemployment payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>In answer to the Deputy's question, since the start of the scheme there have been 88,336 people from Cork who have availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).

The draft Government Order to establish the Commission was also approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas at that time. <\/p>  <p>  The overarching objective in developing the terms of reference was to establish a statutory investigation capable of providing a full account of what happened in these institutions over the period 1922 to 1998. The approach taken involved a clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who resided in Mother and Baby Homes over the period.<\/p>  <p>  In examining the exit pathways of children, Article 1(VII) of the terms of reference tasked the Commission with examining the nature of the relationship between Mother and Baby Homes and other key institutions &ndash; these included children&rsquo;s homes; orphanages; and adoption societies. This involved the identification of patterns of referral and the practices and arrangements for the placement of children. It also included where an intermediary organisation was involved in arranging a subsequent placement.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s final Report addresses important questions in relation to the practices for the placement of children that were in place during the period under investigation. The Commission was able to cross-reference information from the institutional records, State records, testimony from witnesses and evidence from other sources.<\/p>  <p>  For this reason, it is not accurate to suggest that the experiences of persons who were boarded were excluded from the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters). This is evident in the 77 pages of detailed analysis on related matters in Chapter 11 - Boarded Out Children of the Commission's Final Report. <\/p>  <p>  The process of developing the detailed terms of reference for the Commission was led by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and supported by a high level Inter-Departmental Group on Mother and Baby Homes. <\/p>  <p>  Following a motion approved by Dail Eireann on 11 June 2014, which committed to the establishment of a Commission of Investigation, the then Minister engaged in a comprehensive scoping process to define the appropriate scope and format for this investigation. The Minister was assisted by an Inter-Departmental Group established with the task of gathering relevant information and reporting to Government on the means by which these complex matters could be investigated. <\/p>  <p>  The role of the Inter-Departmental Group was to inform the Government's deliberations on the scope, format and terms of reference of the Commission of Investigation.  The Group comprised of representatives from eight Departments and the Attorney General's Office and was chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The process drew upon a number of cited secondary sources, in particular a number of published social histories, to complement information from records held by the Department of Health and the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office.<\/p>  <p>  The Group's Report was published in July 2014 and is available on my Department's website.  This initial examination served to highlight the complexity of the issue and the volume of records that were potentially relevant to the work of the Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs also had regard to his consultations with opposition parties, key stakeholders and the response to the call for submissions on the Terms of Reference, all of which informed the Government&rsquo;s considerations.

The number of confirmed cases from those files has now increased to 151.<\/p>  <p>  While there have been suspicions about the practice of illegal or incorrect registrations for many years, and indeed the Department was informed of such suspicions, it is very difficult to confirm cases of illegal birth registrations. This is due to a number of factors including the historic nature of the cases, and the fact that, as falsely registering a birth is and always has been an offence, it is very unlikely that records will be kept of the practice.<\/p>  <p>  The State has a responsibility to reach a high level of certainty before it determines that births have been illegally registered and proceeds to contact the individuals concerned. The cases uncovered in the St Patricks Guild files were confirmed once a rigorous process was completed to ensure that the State could be as confident as possible that these individuals' births were in fact illegally registered. To the Department's knowledge, the cases announced in May 2018 represent the first time the required threshold of a high level of certainty was reached on the basis of the information on the files, and in particular the existence of a marker \"adopted from birth&rdquo;. There is no guarantee that the same level of evidence is to be found in relation to other historic adoption records, that would allow a suspicion to be confirmed as an illegal birth registration. <\/p>  <p>  Following the discovery of evidence of illegal birth registration in the St. Patrick Guild files, an independent review was commissioned in 2018 to investigate whether there are markers to indicate a practice of illegal birth registration in the records of other adoption agencies and similar institutions.  The publication of this review, which took place yesterday, had to await the final report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission, as it encroached on the work of that Commission. A copy of that report is available on my Department's website. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100070#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100070#WRH04900"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[13768\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100070#WRH05100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the employer groups and trade unions his Department has consulted with on the establishment of a statutory entitlement to paid domestic violence leave in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[13769\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100070#WRH05200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the dates on which the establishment of a statutory entitlement to paid domestic violence leave has been included on the meeting agenda of the monitoring committee of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[13770\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100070#WRH05250","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that his Department&rsquo;s scoping of a scheme of domestic violence leave which includes the international models and the identification of best practice is not included in the current list of live studies, reviews and research undertaken or commissioned by him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time\/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers.

In recent years, ring-fenced funding has also been provided for students on Professional Master of Education (PME) courses. <\/p>  <p>  - Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) &ndash; &euro;9.6m in funding every year covering both higher and further education sectors. The purpose of the Fund for Students with Disabilities is to provide funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. Since 2018 the fund covers part-time students.<\/p>  <p>  - A study commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on the challenges facing mature students in participating in higher education is nearing completion and will be considered in the context of the new National Access Plan commencing in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  - The Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021 was launched in 2019 and its aim is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum.<\/p>  <p>  - Persons in the protection process (asylum and subsidiary protection) or leave to remain process are not eligible to access the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. However, the administratively based Student Support Scheme provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme and is available to persons in the asylum, subsidiary protection or leave to remain process.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the System Performance Framework 2018-2020, HEIs are required to put in place whole-of-institution Student Success Strategies to address the issue of non-completion of programmes, particularly for those in under-represented target groups.   It was hoped to have this in place by the end of 2020 but due to the COVID 19 restrictions this important work will run into 2021.<\/p>  <p>  A new National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education will be developed in 2021 for the years 2022-2026. Consultations on the approach to the development of the Plan has commenced. <\/p>  <p>  Science Foundations Ireland's Education and Public Engagement programme seeks to promote the awareness and engagement of the Irish public with science, technology, engineering and maths.   This work supports the growth in confidence of the Irish public to be informed and reflective on societal challenges we face together. Creativity, talent, the ability to innovate and to understand science will be required to ensure citizens can fully participate in our society and economy, both now and in the future. The research agencies under my Department overarching aim across all their work is to contribute to the betterment of society and to help foster an engaged and informed public that values research. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation","counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[13751\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the annual security cost of keeping Thornton Hall for the past three years to date; the last time and the due time for renewal of the contract to keep the site secured; the rates paid and or due on the site historically; and her plans to dispose of or develop the site.","asker":"1489","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[13760\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a project (details supplied); her plans for the fully serviced site; the cost of maintaining the site in each of the past three years and to date in 2021; the cost of security of the site for the past three years to date; if she has requested a market valuation of the site; if the working group in her Department has produced a report on the site; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":484,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 177 together.<\/p><p>I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Irish Prison Service and will contact the Deputy as soon as it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[13578\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100071#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; that have been redeployed in 2020 due to the hiring of civilian non-sworn staff.","asker":"1488","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.

The vast majority of referrals into the Psychology Service are in relation to any, or a combination of the following:<\/p><p>Mental health difficulties including, but not exclusive to: Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Disorders of Personality and Behaviour, (complex) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Self-Harm and Suicidal Behaviours, Eating Disorders, Psychosis and Schizophrenia; and<\/p><p>Risk-related presentations including: need for a strengths, needs and risk assessment of the various factors including violence or other anti\u00adsocial behaviour (past or present), relationship difficulties, employment difficulties, substance misuse, that culminated in the perpetration of an offence (and those factors that support desistance), preparation of Parole Board reports, risk-related intervention by addressing the underlying risk factors that increase the likelihood that an individual will become a victim or a perpetrator of violence, complex case and risk management consultation.  <\/p><p>The number of prisoners waiting to access prison psychology services as of 9th March 2021, is set out in Table 1.  <\/p><p><b>Table 1.

Both services have adapted working arrangements to respond innovatively to supporting prisoners by introducing a blended model of working which facilitates prisoner engagement with practitioners employing a combination of mediums including telephony, video link and one to one contact, where deemed clinically necessary. However, notwithstanding this, service delivery is constrained and has resulted in a reduction of sessions delivered by Psychology and Addiction Services.<\/p><p>It important to note that services to prisoners, including healthcare and addiction services, are provided through a combination of staff directly employed or engaged by the Prison Service such as healthcare staff; psychologists and addiction counsellors, and other specialist and in-reach services provided by external agencies such as psychiatrists; dentists and social workers. <\/p><p>Many of the services that could be categorised as &ldquo;social work&rdquo; fall into a range of areas and responsibilities including: medical social workers; psychiatric social workers; housing welfare officers; and child welfare officers.

On 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. <\/p>  <p>  Data indicates that 104 nursing homes are actively dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak. Noting that on 6th March approximately 525 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, the level of risk, including to residents of nursing homes remains high. The public health advice remains clear, as noted in the statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team on 24th February &ldquo;Given the increased transmissibility of the virus now, we must continue to limit our social contacts and do all we can to starve this disease of opportunities to spread&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  I recently wrote to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the importance of adopting a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the important role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing. The importance of ensuring that visits take place to the greatest extent possible, in line with public health guidance and risk assessments was reiterated and providers were encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead, published on 23rd February, recognises that the challenge of balancing protective health measures and normal living has been particularly important in the context of visitations to long-term residential care settings (LTRC). LTRC visiting guidance has remained under ongoing review throughout the pandemic.  In light of the advanced stage of rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in LTRCs for both residents and staff, the NPHET (the National Public Health Emergency Team) requested that the HSE progress a process for considering the scope and application of LTRC visiting restrictions in the context of the Framework of Restrictive Measures, having regard to international and national evidence, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the level of disease in the community.  The HSE has drafted new visiting guidance, which will be considered by the NPHET today, 11th March. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100073#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Access","counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100073#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":584,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[13655\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100073#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding access for medical card holders to chiropody services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100073#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100073#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[13657\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100073#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons on inpatient hospital waiting lists by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[13658\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100073#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons on outpatient hospital waiting lists by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.<\/p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for bed capacity related to Covid-19.<\/p><p>This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. <\/p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

Owing to the well-acknowledged positive impact of IMGTI, plans are currently underway to develop and expand the number of specialties and source countries participating on these programmes, to increase further the number of doctors in training. This programme provides a structured route for non-EEA doctors to gain access to clinical experience and training in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  For those NCHDs who hold an NCHD contract with the HSE, and are not enrolled in a postgraduate training programme, the HSE has put in place a number of provisions to support their professional development such as: <\/p>  <p>  - Continuous Professional Development Support Scheme  <\/p>  <p>  The continuous professional development support scheme (CPD&ndash;SS) is funded by the HSE to facilitate NCHDs, who are not in training posts, to continue to maintain and enhance their clinical knowledge and skills, and also to maintain their professional competence in line with Medical Council requirements. Under this scheme, eligible NCHDs are able to undertake training and educational activities of up to 20 external credits or three days per annum, whichever is greatest. NCHDs who register for this scheme are provided free access to a range of clinical courses\/activities provided by all Irish medical training bodies.  The HSE is committed to enhancing the educational offering for NCHDs not presently enrolled in a postgraduate training programme, and are currently working with postgraduate training bodies to explore further developments which can be offered under this scheme. <\/p>  <p>  - Training Support Scheme (TSS) <\/p>  <p>  The Training Support Scheme (TSS), introduced in July 2019, provides a fund of up to &euro;1,250 per annum, allowing an NCHD to apply for reimbursement for approved exams, courses, or conferences.  This scheme is open to all NCHDs. <\/p>  <p>  - Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme (CCERS) <\/p>  <p>  The Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme provides funding towards an approved list of clinical courses and exams, such as membership\/fellowships examinations, and Advanced Cardiac Life Suppport (ACLS).  Since July 2019, the full costs of approved examination\/courses are eligible for refund to NCHDs under the Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme (CCERS) &ndash; this was previously capped at &euro;450. <\/p>  <p>  Claims under both the CCERS and TSS can now be made easily via an NCHD&rsquo;s National Employment Record, which allows NCHDs to submit claims online, and provides complete transparency in terms of claims they may have made, and the balance of funds remaining. <\/p>  <p>  - E-portfolio <\/p>  <p>  National Doctors Training and Planning Unit in the HSE has commenced the development of an E-Portfolio\/Logbook accessible to NCHDs via their National Employment Record.  <\/p>  <p>  The principal objective of the E-Portfolio is to allow NCHDs, who are not on a formal training scheme, access to a generic standard document in which they can record their training and career development. It will also give them the opportunity to have their experience validated by their supervising consultant, where applicable. All NCHDs will be able to access the E-Portfolio.  The E-Portfolio will be launched in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM02200"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[13709\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures his Department is taking to address the mental health strain that Covid-19 is taking on health staff well-being; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>There are a number of measures in place to support staff from an occupational health and well-being perspective, and I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[13710\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures being taken to address staff fatigue as a result of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>There are a number of measures in place to support staff from an occupational health and well-being perspective during this challenging period.

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets should the relevant person remain in care for an extended period of many years.<\/p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. <\/p><p>This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between my officials and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. The Bill is on the priority list for the Spring legislative programme. <\/p><p>While developing the legislation, the Department of Health has considered that assets which have not been transferred more than five years before the owner requires nursing home care remain part of the financial assessment of means. The five-year period in respect of transferred assets has been a constant feature of the Scheme, to act as a means of protecting the Scheme, which is based on the means of those availing of it. The policy intent of the proposed Amendment is to facilitate the continued viability of family owned and operated farms and businesses by providing a degree of certainty on the cost of long term care by applying a cap on the contribution made against such an asset after three years in care. While it is not intended that the five year period in respect of transferred assets will be amended, it is intended that the 3-year cap would apply in such cases should a family successor be nominated by the relevant person.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[13737\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for a continuation of long-term residential care for those whose carers pass away or are no longer able to provide this care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. <\/p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[13741\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100074#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an essential worker (details supplied) will be required to quarantine in a hotel after returning from abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>The Government has introduced more stringent measures applying to international travel in order to mitigate against the risk of new variants being imported through travel and to protect the progress we are making in supressing transmission domestically.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current travel regime passengers arriving into Ireland from overseas are required to complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form, to present evidence of a negative pre-departure RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival and to observe mandatory home quarantine.<\/p>  <p>  Arrivals from \"Category 1 states\" can end the quarantine period if a not-detected PCR result is obtained from a PCR test taken no less than 5 days after arrival.

For example:<\/p><p>- Increased the number of approved postgraduate training places by 106 places for July 2021<\/p><p>- Introduced up to 54 new Senior Fellowship posts for July 2021<\/p><p>- Consultant Appointments Approval Committee has approved 91 new consultant posts since August 2020<\/p><p>Further increases are underway and planned as part of the HSE National Service Plan 2021.<\/p><p>These additional consultants and other senior decision makers will support the delivery of shorter waiting times, the reduction of inappropriate hospital admissions, improved patient flow, and earlier discharge of patients to the community.<\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2021 provides the projected medical\/dental staffing for December 2021, based on projected employment figures.  NCHDs are included as part of the overall medical\/dental staffing requirements.<\/p><p>The planned investment in additional staffing, services, and infrastructure in the 2021 National Service Plan, will allow demonstrable progress to be made towards addressing the particular capacity gaps in both acute and community services, identified in the <i>Health Service Capacity Review 2018<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":710,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN02400"},{"type":"question","counter":711,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[13840\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the shortcomings in the mental health services with particular reference to north County Kildare and the need to provide for those seeking institutional care or specific treatment not currently readily available in Ireland and or local access to psychology services without waiting prolonged periods of time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":712,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN02700"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[13841\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which he expects to improve the supports for children with special needs while requiring therapeutic or residential short-term or long-term assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Reform","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN03000"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[13845\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021031100075#WRN03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which the Sl&aacute;intecare programme is being enacted; the progress to date in this regard; the targets achievable in the next 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>In 2017 the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare set out, in the Sl&aacute;intecare Oireachtas Report, their vision to deliver safe, quality health and social care services that meets the needs of our growing population, and attracts and retains the very best healthcare clinicians, managers, and staff. The vision of Sl&aacute;intecare is to achieve a universal single-tier health and social care system, where everyone has equitable access to services based on need, and not ability to pay. Over time, citizens will have entitlement to a comprehensive range of primary, acute and social care services. The aim is to deliver a universal health service that offers the right care, in the right place, at the right time, at low or no cost.<\/p><p>Following the publication of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare Report in 2017, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy was agreed by Government in August 2018, setting out an initial set of key actions for a three-year period.

take Questions Nos. 257 to 260, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The requirement for certification into and through GB falls to be determined by the UK. Under its Border Operating Model (BOM), the UK is progressively introducing new checks and controls on its trade with the EU on 1st January, 1st April and 1st July.<\/p>  <p>  This requirement places new additional demands on industry and the State. My Department has examined data, including conducting surveys with industry on likely certification requirements. The actual number of veterinary health certificates and other certificates that will be needed from 1st April depends very much on exporters' business practice in response to UK import requirements and wider considerations. For example, business decisions on consolidation of consignments in Ireland and distribution in Great Britain, decisions regarding the continued use of the landbridge for consignments destined for the EU continental market as well as trade impacts arising post-Covid lockdown will all impact on likely certification requirements from 1st April.<\/p>  <p>  Good progress is being made in the implementation of the key elements of my Department's work plan to meet UK import requirements on 1st April. Detailed business processes have been prepared, work on IT systems is on track, and the necessary staffing and training is being put in place to deliver on the certification requirements (this will involve contracted services, some additional recruitment of staff and the temporary reassignment of existing staff). On communications, officials in my Department will continue to engage intensively with industry over the coming weeks to ensure that these systems are in place to provide export health certification on the scale required.<\/p>  <p>  I would urge all exporters to avail of the range of Government supports that are available, including training and grants.
