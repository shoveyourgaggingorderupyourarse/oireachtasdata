For example, in 2020, an additional &euro;370 million was required to enable the continued operation of services due to the collapse of fare intake. In 2021, &euro;659m was required to run PSO services, and this year we have allocated &euro;538 million for the continuation of these essential services. Apportioning such significant levels of Exchequer resources to one goal would undoubtedly impact the State&rsquo;s ability to support other worthy public services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While free public transport is\u00a0available in some\u00a0European locations, I understand that results have varied. The intention is commendable - encouraging modal shift, reducing\u00a0congestion, and capitalising on the associated environmental benefits.

This is counter to our core Government goals of improving citizen&rsquo;s health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While I might not agree that free transport provides a silver bullet solution - I do believe there is merit in incentivising fares when an appropriate balance can be struck.

Where possible I am incentivizing public transport use through investment in new services and infrastructure as well as reducing fare structures. In recognition that it is not always possible to provide public transport, particularly in remote areas, I also have a complementary suite of incentives to electrify private transport such as the EV purchase grant and the domestic charger grant scheme.\u00a0 I am also strongly committed to funding active travel infrastructure to provide more walking and cycling facilities to increase peoples green travel options.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Government is strongly committed to helping combat\u00a0the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being\u00a0introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of\u00a0thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. A further &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.\u00a0The NTA will work with the PSO public transport operators in the coming weeks to commence rolling out these fare reductions across the public transport network in late April\/ early May.<\/p><p>Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured\u00a0&euro;25m\u00a0of funding to provide\u00a0for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will\u00a0allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services.\u00a0It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date. \u00a0This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.\u00a0 The NTA has commenced work in relation to the implementation of\u00a0the new fares&rsquo; structures for young adults, and this includes the application process and establishing a definitive timeline for the introduction of the Scheme.\u00a0<\/p><p>A new 90-minute fare has also been\u00a0 introduced by the NTA to coincide with Phase 2 of BusConnects \u00a0which gives customers the option to transfer between Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin at no additional fare.<\/p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be pleased to hear that the new Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan will significantly benefit those living in rural Ireland.

The aim of this plan is to increase public transport connectivity over a five-year period, particularly for people living outside the major cities and towns. That means that by 2025, Ireland will see a 25% overall increase in rural bus services. Over 100 rural towns and villages will benefit from frequent public transport services for the first time ever.

Newer systems such as the Luas are fully accessible, as are all new buses purchased by the NTA. <\/p>  <p>  However, the real challenge is in relation to upgrading older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible. The difficulties and frustrations experienced by people with disabilities using such legacy infrastructure, bus and train stations, have been outlined many times.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to these legacy bus and trains stations, or hubs as they are sometimes called, my Department funds the multi-annual ringfenced Public Transport Accessibility Retrofit Programme. This programme, which is managed by the NTA, includes projects to upgrade bus bays at regional bus and train stations and to upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to bus stations, accessibility audits have now been carried out at 18 stations, In 2021, the NTA provided funding to install wheelchair accessible bays for coaches with wheelchair lifts and other external improvements in 23 Bus Eireann stations.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to train stations, accessibility works have either been recently completed or are ongoing at several stations. For example, footbridges were installed at Carlow, Ennis and Edgeworthstown stations last year, while works are underway at Dalkey and Gormanstown stations.<\/p>  <p>  This is in addition to the four-year &ldquo;Big Lift&rdquo; programme that Irish Rail is undertaking to upgrade lifts at 52 stations across the network. On the Luas network, \u00a0a system-wide upgrade of lifts is planned, with a scoping exercise currently being undertaken. These projects are particularly important as lifts out of service significantly impacts people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, in addition, to make the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; infrastructure and services accessible, it is crucial to provide the &ldquo;softer&rdquo; type of support to enable Persons with Disabilities to travel independently on public transport, including traversing through bus and train stations.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA and the transport companies have several initiatives underway which aligns with the UNCRPD, including the provision of Disability Awareness Training to frontline staff, the rollout of the Just a Minute (JAM) Card to assist anyone with a communications difficulty, and ensuring that information is provided in accessible formats for public transport services at stations and platforms.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Travel Assistance Scheme, managed by Dublin Bus, aims to give people with disabilities the confidence they need to use public transport and has been successfully operating for 13 years in the Greater Dublin Area. To further this, the NTA plans to roll out the Travel Assist Scheme to Cork later this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the continual improvement of accessibility within the public transport system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300059#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300059#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[11271\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300059#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding prioritising the provision of a new relief road for the N80 in Mountmellick.","asker":"1491","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

This work was coordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the development of the required infrastructure by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Planning is continuing for a new state of the art Border Control Post in Rosslare Europort for the carrying out of customs, agriculture and health checks on trade with Great Britain. Currently these checks are undertaken in temporary facilities in Kilrane, some 1.3km outside of the Port. Planning permission for the permanent facilities was secured by the OPW in 2021 and a public procurement process is underway. The project will avail of funding under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, Ireland has seen a significant number of new shipping services develop over the last two years in response to Brexit.\u00a0 Our ports continue to respond with new and additional direct ferry links to mainland Europe with increased capacity coming on stream in response to Brexit and the pandemic (including to Cherbourg, Dunkerque, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Roscoff and Santander). <\/p>  <p>  In line with NDP objectives and National Ports Policy, the State ports are continuing to progress projects under their Masterplans. The Ports of Dublin, Cork, Shannon Foynes and Rosslare will spend &euro;144m in capital expenditure in 2022 and up to &euro;473m over the next five years. These non-exchequer funded investments will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s capacity and connectivity and will allow the ports to respond to market needs, handle increases in ship sizes and frequency and serve the import and export needs of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the State Ports operate as independent commercial entities with no funding from the State. All infrastructure development must be funded through their own revenues, borrowing or disposal of assets. Additionally eligible TEN-T ports can apply for funding for port infrastructure under the Connecting Europe Funding facility (CEF) which is the funding instrument for the EU's Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T).\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300060#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300060#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[11492\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300060#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the measures taken or proposed to ensure that the transport sector is capable of doing its job without contributing to inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, transport is a derived demand - one that is driven by economic and social need.\u00a0 A cost-efficient sector, including affordable and accessible public transport services, is vital to a functioning economy.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, a number of measures have been taken to ensure services remain affordable.\u00a0 In Budget 2022, my department secured approximately &euro;538m of funding for Public Service Obligation (PSO) and Local Link services. &euro;25m\u00a0was also provided for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC).\u00a0 This new measure will enable any person aged between 19 and 23 years old to avail of an average fare discount of 50% across all public transport services, including city, intercity and rural services.<\/p>  <p>  Further, as part of a suite of new measures being introduced by Government to help combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country, a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services is also due to be introduced over the coming weeks.

With approximately 50,500 EVs currently in Ireland, this target is very challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceiling in future years.<\/p><p>A national ambition has been firmly established that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emission capable.\u00a0<\/p><p>The European Commission have indicated that a complete ban of the marketing, import or registration of new ICE vehicles in a single Member State is not compatible with EU law, and an EU-wide approach is therefore required.

It will put in place stronger CO<b><sub>2<\/sub><\/b>emissions standards for cars and vans to accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility by requiring manufacturers, on a fleet-wide basis, to reduce the average emissions of cars and vans they produce. <\/p><p>Under the proposal, average emissions of new cars should be reduced by 55% from 2030 and 100% from 2035 compared to 2021 levels. For new vans, the net reduction targets would be 50% and 100% respectively. As a result, all new cars and vans registered as of 2035 in the EU will be zero-emission.<\/p><p>The proposal would also remove the ZLEV (zero- and light-emission vehicle) incentive scheme after 2030. This is part of the existing Regulation and allows manufacturers that produce more ZLEVs additional leeway in their overall target. It is expected that, at this stage, the market uptake of ZLEVs will be driven by the stricter CO2 targets applicable from 2030 rather than any incentive mechanisms. <\/p><p>Accelerating the transition to low emitting light duty vehicles (LDVs) is paramount to achieving Ireland's emission reduction targets. Emissions from cars and vans in Ireland dominate land transport emissions at 51% and 7% respectively, and Ireland has a national commitment to phase out sales of new petrol\/diesel cars by 2030. Wider availability of zero-emission vehicles will provide Irish consumers with greater choice and accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility.<\/p><p>While the proposed targets are welcome, Ireland is seeking opportunities to accelerate and increase the ambition of the file in recognition that early momentum in this decade is crucial to affect the substantial change required to reach the EU 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target and commitments made under the Paris Agreement.<\/p><p>Analysis for the uptake of EVs in Ireland is based on the assumption that Irish car fleet growth between 2020 and 2030 will be at a rate similar to between 2010 and 2020. It is expected that the sale of electric vehicles will displace those of internal combustion engines in the coming years which will replace CO2 emitting vehicles with zero-emission tailpipe equivalents. While EV battery production can result in higher CO2 emissions, as technology improves and more renewable energy sources are deployed globally, I anticipate that the CO2 impacts of battery production will reduce over the coming years.\u00a0 I also note that Ireland does not have a vehicle-manufacturing sector, so the issue of production does not arise specifically with regard to our national emissions. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300060#WRC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":157,"content":"<p>Question No. 59 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300060#WRC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[11272\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300060#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans for increasing the services and passenger numbers on the Ballybrophy to Limerick rail line.","asker":"1491","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day provision and operation of public transport.\u00a0<\/p><p>The issue raised by the Deputy regarding plans for increasing the services and passenger numbers on the Ballybrophy to Limerick rail line is an operational matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.\u00a0<\/p><p>Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300060#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[11776\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the processes that will have to be gone through to bring the development of the Galway city bypass M6\/N6 road to construction; the projected timescale involved with each process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>As\u00a0Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer\u00a0funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

My Department is very supportive of hydrogen as a transport fuel with a potential role in decarbonising hard to abate sectors such as freight, public transport and moving forward the role it may play in decarbonising aviation and maritime. <\/p>  <p>  To date, my Department has been acting as a policy advisor for any and all working groups looking at hydrogen development in Ireland such as the Hydrogen Mobility Ireland (HMI). In 2021, three double-deck hydrogen buses were procured, trialled and put into service by the NTA on Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Rathoath to Dublin route. In continuing to support the hydrogen rollout, the Department established the Alternatively Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme which, while being technology-neutral, will allow applicants to apply for forty to sixty per cent of the cost differential of a new hydrogen FCEV. In Budget 2021, the Department worked with the Department of Finance to introduce hydrogen refuelling equipment into the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme which allows applicants to claim 100% of the capital cost of eligible equipment. <\/p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement was published in November 2021. The Policy Statement sets out the pathway for increasing the supply and use of renewable fuels in transport. The Policy Statement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s obligation under European directives to require increased supply of renewable fuels used in transport, such as hydrogen. As an incentive for producing renewable hydrogen, suppliers will be allowed to claim multiple credits when supplying green hydrogen onto the market. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has also been working with the Department of the Taoiseach under the Shared Island initiative to progress all-island hydrogen research. On January 31, the Department published a request for tender requesting a desktop study exploring hydrogen safety regulation and how this may be established in Ireland and ensuring the interoperability of refuelling stations on the island. Once finished, this will lead to further work with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive. This in addition to research my Department is co-funding with the SEAI on looking at appropriate fuels for certain contexts in Ireland which will explore where hydrogen is best suited for use.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department also sits on the Interdepartmental Working Group on Hydrogen which is chaired by officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and actively contributes to the development of national hydrogen policy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[11041\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of persons awaiting a driving test in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>The Road Safety Authority is responsible for the operation of the\u00a0driving test service and the information requested is held by them.

Other members of Government, including the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, have also met with taxi driver representatives. On each of these occasions, we have been able to hear first-hand of the issues affecting the taxi industry. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to supports for the sector, the vast majority of measures taken to support the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic, remain in place.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the height of the pandemic. The PUP was re-opened before the end of last year until 25 March to support people who lost their employment as a result of COVID public health restrictions introduced from 7 December 2021. For some people, PUP will have ended before this date as the payment rates are gradually reduced. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, in Budget 2022, I secured funding of &euro;6.5 million for a series of specific measures to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022, and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website.\u00a0Many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles,\u00a0I announced on February 4th last, the\u00a0re-opening of the eSPSV Grant Scheme with a further &euro;15 million allocated to it for 2022.\u00a0 The take-up rate for this Scheme was exceptionally high in 2021: almost 600 drivers successfully applied for grants, with over &euro;11 million paid out as well as &euro;4 million in provisional grant offers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the independent regulator of the sector, the NTA has been in constant contact with taxi operators, drivers and representatives throughout the pandemic via email, text messages and phone calls.\u00a0 In addition, the Deputy should be aware that the NTA has now started work on a new National Maximum Fare Review and is engaging with its service providers in the matter.\u00a0 This Review, which is undertaken on a regular basis by the NTA, assesses any changes in the market facing the taxi industry as well as changes in annual taxi operating costs.\u00a0 These costs include the fixed and running costs of an average taxi and labour costs.\u00a0 The objective of the Review is to determine whether changes need to be made to the current level of maximum fares and the NTA has confirmed that it is endeavouring to conclude the review process as quickly as possible in 2022, whilst still ensuring that all steps, including a consultation process, are appropriately completed.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[11040\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the details of bus stations in County Donegal that are included in the Public Transport Accessibility Programme; the type of works planned; the date for the completion of the works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, while I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport, it is the National Transport Authority (NTA) which has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of accessible public passenger transport services and infrastructure.

The changes to the Scheme are in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also committed us to legislating for e-bikes. While e-bikes are already provided for in Irish legislation in the Road Traffic Acts, the Road Traffic and Roads Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas, proposes to clarify the legal definitions for high-powered and low-powered e-bikes. This will act to encourage the growing cohort of e-cyclists in      Ireland by giving certainty as to the legal status of their vehicle. In line with European legislation, high-powered e-bikes will be considered to be a kind of light moped or &lsquo;L-category&rsquo; vehicle. Accordingly, they will be required to be registered, taxed and insured. Users will require a driver&rsquo;s licence for L-category vehicles and the relevant rules of the road for mopeds and      motorbikes will apply.<\/p>  <p>  Low-powered pedal-assist e-bikes, capable of achieving speeds up to 25 km\/h, will continue to be treated in the same way as pedal bicycles under law and the relevant rules of the road for bicycles will apply accordingly. As is currently the case, this type of e-bike will not require registration, taxation, or a licence.<\/p>  <p>  No distinction is drawn in the Road Traffic Acts between cycles (bicycles or tricycles) used for the carriage of persons or the carriage of goods and these rules therefore apply equally to e-cargo bikes.<\/p>  <p>  Providing a sustainable, low-carbon transport system is a key priority of my Department. The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the\u00a0Climate Action Plan,\u00a0and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the\u00a0Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices.\u00a0A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have\u00a0collectively contributed\u00a0to increased take up\u00a0of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 50,500 now. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department convened the\u00a0Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group\u00a0to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The\u00a0EVPP Working Group\u00a0comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group\u00a0were approved by Government and the full report is available online. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware that the cost of\u00a0electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[12057\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300061#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will commission a study into the impacts and benefits of moving to the provision of fare free public transport across the country, specifically its impact on transport greenhouse gas emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

A national charging infrastucture strategy is due to be published for public consultation early this year which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy regarding the increased usage of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is primarily driven by the Climate Action Plan which sets a target of 945,000 EVs by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally friendly means of charging, especially when using night rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a requirement that new buildings and those undergoing substantial renovation works will have to include charging points for electric vehicles if they have more than 10 car parking spaces. <\/p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. As regards existing apartment buildings, work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort and which will support installation of public chargers particularly in areas without own driveway.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the national charging infrastucture strategy will consider this issue in particular and develop proposals to address the current disparity between homeowners with and without off street parking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300062#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300062#WRE00600"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[11978\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300062#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the alternative proposal by a group (details supplied) for Metrolink which would opt for St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green rather than Charlemont being the interchange between Metrolink and the Luas Green Line and continuing the Metrolink to an underground station at Portobello which could also facilitate future expansion of Metrolink to the south west of the city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1485","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>MetroLink is likely the largest ever public investment project in the history of the State and has been subject to extensive non-statutory public consultation since 2018.

This is a 42% increase when compared to the number of residential dwellings commenced in 2020 (21,686).

Part 2 of the 2020 Act provided for the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 during the Covid-19 emergency period up to 1 August 2020, to better protect tenants by prohibiting rent increases in all cases, and tenancy terminations in all but limited and exceptional cases having regard to:<\/p>  <p>- the threat to public health presented by Covid-19,<\/p>  <p>- the highly contagious nature of that disease, and<\/p>  <p>- the need to restrict the movement of persons in order to prevent\u00a0the spread of the disease among the population.<\/p>  <p>  From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted for all, apart from the most vulnerable tenants, with regard to the prevailing threat to public health at that time. The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020. This Act provides for a moratorium on evictions taking place in the event of peoples&rsquo; movements being restricted on public health grounds to within 5km of their home under Section 31A Health Regulations made by the Minister for Health. These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) and subsequently, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provided that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during, or in respect of any part of, the period from 1 August 2020 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 9 July 2021, provided for an extension of the enhanced protections under the PDRTA until 12 January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  During the 18 months from August 2020 to January 2022, 579 tenants out of almost 300,000 tenancies, sent a self-declaration to the RTB indicating they were unable to pay their rent as a result of the impact of Covid-19.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The RTVA also provides that permanent protections apply, through new procedures requiring landlords to serve both the RTB and the tenant with both the 28-day warning notice seeking payment of rent arrears and also any related notice of termination. Upon receipt of the warning notice, the RTB acknowledges receipt to the landlord and the tenant and provides information to the tenant to enable him or her to get advice from the Money and Budgeting Advice Service (MABS) and offers assistance to the tenant in obtaining this advice. Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. The aim is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at a local level.\u00a0 Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities.<\/p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.\u00a0 A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.\u00a0 It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the services and the funding required to address homelessness in each region.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the preparation of Homelessness Action Plans, with particular focus on the incorporation of Housing for All actions into these plans.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM).<\/p>  <p>  Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms\/ standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.  The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association (CCMA).<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. The Project Team will work with and report to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Fire Service Operations Committee in the performance of its functions.<\/p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group.<\/p>  <p>  That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including central and local government, fire service management\/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report.

As a number of facilities are operated privately in the Dublin Region, the DRHE have adapted the NQSF standards in order to apply their provisions to private emergency accommodation and presented these standards to the Dublin Region strategic management group and consultative forum in September 2021.These standards are to be applied to private emergency accommodation, with the owner \/ operator responsible for the physical standards and the visiting support teams responsible for the support and case management standards.  The DRHE appointed a Development Officer in January 2022, to roll out these standards in private emergency accommodation and to co-ordinate training with the HSE for staff working in these settings.  The Development Officer will also co-ordinate quarterly key performance indicator (KPI) returns from the beginning of 2022.<\/p><p>Monitoring and inspection of services is an important element of the NQSF Framework. The Framework seeks to ensure levels of quality in the provision of temporary accommodation and related services for homeless persons.

The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds with a maximum value of 90% of market value of a residential property.

These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4)\u00a0expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of\u00a0affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes will be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, 2,550 Affordable Purchase homes and 1,580 Cost Rental homes are targeted for delivery for 2022. Annual targets will increase incrementally in subsequent years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will support eligible purchasers of Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations setting out the detailed eligibility criteria for the scheme are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, as part of the Housing for All strategy, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the Land Development Agency in order for it to deliver on its pipeline of housing. This includes Project Tosaigh under which the LDA will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently assessing the proposals received.<\/p>  <p>  Over 1,500 Cost Rental homes are expected to be developed and tenanted through three delivery strands in 2022: Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan\u00a0(CREL) funding; Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), and the Land Development Agency (LDA), either on their portfolio of sites, or through Project Tosaigh. All Cost Rental homes will deliver rent prices at least 25% below market rates.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The First Home shared equity scheme, under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps reflecting median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications in the second half of this year.\u00a0This initiative is being designed to ensure support is provided to those that, because of the current income levels, cannot secure a sufficient mortgage to meet the cost of a modest newly constructed home in their preferred location.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally the Help-to-Buy incentive supports first-time buyers in meeting the deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. The Help-to-Buy scheme has already helped over 30,000 first-time buyers achieve the deposit required for a new home.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the\u00a0Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022 and incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility thresholds for single applicants in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow (increasing from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000), and more flexibility on house size. The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds with a maximum value of 90% of market value of a residential property.

Following the launch of the strategy last September we issued social housing targets to all local authority Chief Executives for the 5 years 2022 to 2026.  Of the national target of over 50,000 new social homes, I&rsquo;m asking Carlow County Council to deliver 464 over those years, through their own projects and also working with the housing associations.<\/p><p>For the purpose of tracking social housing delivery, a Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) is published each quarter by my Department. This provides details of the individual social housing build projects in the programme of each local authority, including Carlow County Council.. It sets out the locations of the social housing schemes, the number of homes being delivered and the current status of the scheme, including those currently on site and under construction. The most recent CSR publication covers the period up to the end of Quarter 3 of 2021, and is available at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/feea9-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q3-2021\/<\/i>.

The First Home shared equity scheme will be available nationally on a demand-led basis. This scheme will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing new homes through the private market.

The County and City Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response did not permit on-site rental inspections for long periods in 2020 and 2021. This was in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors. Even when restrictions were relaxed there was still a reluctance on the part of some tenants to allow authorised inspectors access their homes. Inspections have been and continue to be frustrated by some tenants needing to self-isolate due to having Covid-19 or being a close contact.<\/p><p>In response to the disruption caused by the pandemic some local authorities piloted virtual inspections which my Department supported with Exchequer funding. Dublin City Council led this initiative and commenced virtual inspections in May 2020. The  Department incorporated and standardised the approach taken countrywide into a pilot programme, requesting business cases from participating local authorities to ensure that processes are suitably robust and comprehensive. <\/p><p>It is a key component of the virtual inspection model that local authorities reserve the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so and landlords were advised accordingly. Many rented dwellings have been subsequently re-inspected physically, since pandemic restrictions have eased.<\/p><p>Since the CCMA allowed the resumption of on-site inspections in July 2021 many councils participating in the pilot programmes ceased virtual inspections, but a number have continued to undertake some. Q4 2021 inspection data is currently being collated and verified but indications are that virtual inspections accounted for circa 5% of all inspections undertaken in that period.<\/p><p>As set down in <i>Housing for All<\/i>I envisage virtual inspections playing an important supporting role to the traditional on-site inspection regime, with on-site inspections accounting for the majority of inspections undertaken.

Our approach is aligned with the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations, which advocates that initiatives which will serve as &lsquo;living legacies&rsquo; for the Decade of Centenaries would be particularly beneficial, such as those that highlight the importance of original research and scholarship at national and local level, promoting free, public access to authentic historical sources.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Expert Advisory Group advises that local commemorative endeavours could helpfully focus on acknowledging the significance of the event or action, rather than on the individual personalities involved, which would be a matter for personal commemoration and personal remembrance.\u00a0The Group advocates that the emphasis must always be on remembrance and commemoration of locally significant historical events and the avoidance of any sense of celebration.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300070#WRN03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":655,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300070#WRN03200"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[12191\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300070#WRN03300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when an organisation (details supplied) can expect to receive its successful funding under the sports capital grant 2020.","asker":"1566","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>The club to which the Deputy refers, was provisionally allocated a grant of &euro;7,641 last August for the purchase of sports equipment under the 2020 round of the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme.

The planning system itself is complex with many different processes, scenarios and timelines so the development of a solution that takes account of the complex planning code together with the required integration of the developed system with 3 existing back-end planning systems and 8 existing document management systems across 31 planning authorities was not a straightforward process. <\/p><p>However, following initial system development and a re-scoping exercise carried out in 2020, a revised project schedule for agreed functionality was agreed.

This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. <\/p><p>From 2014 to 2021, expenditure of some &euro;261 million was recouped to local authorities under the Voids Programme which funded the return to productive use of 18,527 properties nationwide. Local authorities also provide significant funding from their own resources to address the level of vacancy within the social housing stock.<\/p><p>There has been extensive funding provided particularly over the last two years under the Voids programme which not only catered for standard relets but also for vacant properties requiring more extensive works prior to relet. It is up to each local authority to submit a programme of works based on their individual allocation or targets.<\/p><p>In 2020, &euro;56.4m exchequer funding was provided to bring a total of 3,607 vacant homes back into productive use within the social housing stock. This represents the highest ever yearly spend and the highest number of homes to be refurbished under the voids programme. Within this programme local authorities had the opportunity to remediate long term vacant properties (houses vacant over 12 months) the funding for which was uncapped. Again in 2021, the Voids programme catered for a non-standard refurbishment option which allowed local authorities claim an average of &euro;50,000 funding in this category (no vacancy limit). <\/p><p>In relation to the announcement in May 2021 it is important to note this was not a stimulus Voids Programme but rather a normal Voids Programme. The Voids stimulus programme was announced in July 2020 and made available to local authorities in recognition of the very challenging financial circumstances which they were experiencing with a very real risk that the vacant homes, which would normally be refurbished by local authorities using their own resources, would be significantly impacted in 2020.  <\/p><p>Full details in relation to output of Galway County Council, Galway City Council and all other local authorities is available on the link below.<\/p><p><i>www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/0906a-other-local-authority-housing-scheme-statistics\/#voids-programme<\/i>.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area in 2022, however, as result of the significant investment by the Department in the Voids Programme, local authorities should also now be in a strong position to begin the transition to a strategic and informed planned maintenance approach to stock management and maintenance. To that end my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach.<\/p><p>It is also of note that Local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock. This will fluctuate over time as tenancy surrender and re-letting of dwellings is an ongoing process. Details in relation to the number of voids are not collated by my Department, however, statistics in relation to social housing stock, at a point in time, are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in their Annual Reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities.

Affordability and the chance to own a home are at the heart of this Government&rsquo;s housing policy. It recognises that significant new supports are needed so that those who want to own their own home can do so, and that those who wish to rent are able to do so at an affordable rate. <\/p><p>While many housing issues are complex to tackle, a simple lack of supply to meet demand is a significant part of the problem. Housing for All addresses this and aims to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 homes per year over the next decade. Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes, and 18,000 cost rental homes.\u00a0<\/p><p>To help support this ambitious delivery, Housing for All is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the\u00a0sector\u00a0with\u00a0the certainty and stability it needs.\u00a0<\/p><p>There is a targeted approach right across the country to supply housing where it is needed most. A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All.\u00a0<\/p><p>All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December.\u00a0My Department is now working closely with each local authority and the Housing Delivery Coordination Office to review the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All.\u00a0This will require further engagement with local authorities in the coming weeks.\u00a0It is intended to publish the Plans in Quarter 2 of 2022 when this process of assessment and engagement has concluded.<\/p><p>There are a number of encouraging indications of increased construction activity at this early stage. We are seeing a strong supply pipeline, with Commencement Notices data showing a total number of 30,724 residential dwellings commenced in 2021. This is a 42% increase when compared to the number of residential dwellings commenced in 2020 (21,686). The 2021 total is almost equal to the combined totals for 2016 and 2017 (30,816).<\/p><p>New figures shows that in the past twelve months (February 2021 to January 2022), Commencement Notices for 31,201 new homes were received. This is the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data was first published. The breakdown, by local authority area, is available in the Statistics Dashboard of the Housing for All campaign page at following weblink:<i>www.gov.ie\/en\/campaigns\/dfc50-housing-for-all\/#<\/i>. <\/p><p>With regard to the number of homes built, there were 20,433 new dwellings completed in 2021. Completions for 2022 and 2023 are projected to exceed the\u00a0Housing for All\u00a0targets of 24,600 and 29,000 respectively. The Central Bank forecasts that some 27,000 and 31,000 homes will be completed in 2022 and 2023 respectively.<\/p><p>Increasing the supply of housing as set out in\u00a0Housing for All\u00a0is the top priority for me and the Government and we have made a good start on our path towards this goal. However, I acknowledge that we are coming from a low base of supply and that it will take some time before the full benefits of\u00a0the plan are tangible to our citizens. There are however a number of key schemes and initiatives that will support the delivery of affordable homes at scale:<\/p><p>The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.<\/p><p>Changes have also be made to the current Local Authority Home Loan Scheme which enable first-time buyers, on middle incomes, to access sustainable mortgages to purchase new or second-hand properties, or to self-build. The product\u00a0has been\u00a0changed by lowering the interest rate for new borrowers by 0.25% and raising the maximum income ceiling for single persons to &euro;65,000 in counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow.\u00a0<\/p><p>New Cost Rental homes are now becoming available as we speak. Under Cost Rental, homes will be provided at rents that are set to cover only the cost of financing, building, managing and maintaining the homes. Over the period to 2026, it is intended that approximately 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered in our urban centres that will provide affordable rental homes in the order of 25% below market rents.<\/p><p>The LDA also has a key role to play, including through &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at accelerating the delivery of up to 5,000 homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative to bring privately developed units to market affordably and quickly was launched on 12 November 2021. The LDA issued a call for Expressions of Interest for advance purchase agreements to developers, with a target scheme scale in excess of 150 units per development, in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The Expressions of Interest submitted are currently being assessed by the LDA with their priority focus and engagement being on schemes with potential delivery in 2022 and 2023. These homes will be targeted at those middle-income households that do not qualify for social housing, but struggle to afford open market housing, i.e. household incomes of broadly &euro;45,000 to &euro;80,000 per annum.<\/p><p>The Affordable Housing Fund has replaced the Serviced Sites Fund. The Fund has been open for applications from 1 September 2021. My Department is actively engaging with the Local Authorities to support and encourage them to develop and submit proposals. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes. <\/p><p>The housing challenge remains immense, and continues to be affected by ongoing challenges including COVID-19 related delays, supply chain difficulties and inflationary pressure.

Our annual targets include the delivery of 90,000 new social homes and 54,000 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.<\/p><p>In relation to increased delivery of social homes and the reduction of housing waiting lists, there is a target to build 9,000 new social homes in 2022 and there is a strong pipeline in place to support this delivery. The Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) published each quarter provides scheme level detail on social housing new build activity in each local authority, including those delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). The most recent report for Quarter 3 2021 shows that there were 9,746 social homes under construction onsite with an additional 9,559 homes at various stages of design and procurement. <\/p><p>Through Housing for All, we are also strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects. I approved over 200 new staff for local authority housing delivery teams in December 2021. These posts will increase the capacity of local authorities to initiate, manage and deliver new build housing schemes. <\/p><p>In relation to affordable housing, the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation, established a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.<\/p><p>This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent will be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through the First Home Scheme, a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.<\/p><p>A Housing Delivery Action Plan currently being prepared by each Local Authority will underpin delivery targets to 2026.  Local authorities submitted the first iteration of their plans in December and my officials have now met with each authority. I expect that the final Delivery Action Plans will be published in Q2 and these will contain projected delivery over the years 2022 to 2026.<\/p><p>In relation to deposits, in the first instance deposit requirements are set in line with current mortgage regulations which were introduced and are governed by the Central Bank of Ireland, Any review of the macro prudential rules and first-time buyer regulations are a matter for the Central Bank as an independent body.<\/p><p>The Central Bank referenced these requirements in its recently published Financial Stability Review 2021 II. This report is available at the following link; <i>www.centralbank.ie\/docs\/default-source\/publications\/financial-stability-review\/financial-stability\/financial-stability-review-2021-ii.pdf?sfvrsn=4<\/i>.<\/p><p>In this report, the Central Bank concluded that these limits are reducing systematic financial risk, as well as preventing credit dynamics from increasing house prices further than the levels recently experienced.<\/p><p>The Help-to-Buy incentive helps support first-time buyers in meeting deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes, and it can be used in conjunction with the Local Authority Affordable Purchase and First Home schemes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. The Help-to-Buy scheme has already helped over 30,000 first-time buyers achieve the deposit required for a new home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300070#WRN10400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":727,"content":"<p>Question No. 283 answered with Question No. 282.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":728,"content":"<p>Question No. 284 answered with Question No. 282.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":729,"content":"<p>Question No. 285 answered with Question No. 277.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":730,"content":"<p>Question No. 286 answered with Question No. 281.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":731,"content":"<p>Question No. 287 answered with Question No. 281.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":732,"content":"<p>Question No. 288 answered with Question No. 281.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[12301\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300070#WRN11200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the degree to which his Department continues to monitor house price inflation; the action that is in-hand or likely to be taken to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[12302\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300070#WRN11300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the action in hand to discourage house price increases that currently make it difficult or impossible for first-time house buyers to build or acquire a home of their own; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.<\/p><p>Housing for All<i><\/i>is the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing over the next decade.

The plan also commits to reducing the cost of construction. <\/p><p>Recent analysis by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland indicates that construction build costs account for c.47% of total apartment development costs.

The variable and broad symptoms of endometriosis mean that healthcare workers do not easily diagnose it and many individuals suffering from it have limited awareness of the condition. Given that enhanced awareness, followed by early diagnosis and management may slow or halt the natural progression of the disease and reduce the long-term burden of its symptoms, it is critical that GPs are well informed regarding the typical symptoms which should raise a suspicion of endometriosis. GPs should be competent in the basic management of endometriosis and its possible complications in the community. Therefore, the ICGP has been delivering education around endometriosis to its members including a webinar on endometriosis in June 2021 which was attend by 1,567 GPs and a course in community gynaecology, which included the topic of endometriosis, in January of this year. \u00a0Over 200 GPs attended this education module. \u00a0In addition, endometriosis is included in the curriculum for all GP trainees in ICGP.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its plans for 2022, the ICGP is engaging with the HSE's National Women and Infants Programme (NWHIP) to develop a Quick Reference Guide for GPs on the topic of endometriosis which aligns with the Model of Care for Endometriosis that is under development.
