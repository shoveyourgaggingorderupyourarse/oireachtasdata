I am very pleased that the CSO's Monthly April Unemployment release finds that the monthly unemployment rate and the youth unemployment rate have fallen significantly over the last twelve months and now stand at 4.8 percent and 5.6 percent respectively.

Broadly speaking, some key areas of focus include:<\/p>  <p>-  Working with jobseekers through increasing case officer capacity.

Our own case officers and job coaches are currently heavily engaged in supporting people recently arrived from Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>-  Working with employers, both directly one-on-one and through hosting job fairs in Ireland and with the European Public Employment Services.  For example, we have a particular focus on supporting construction sector employers through the recently launched Future Building Ireland programme.  Over the next week we will be running over 40 events nationwide, including a major event in Tallaght Stadium, to connect jobseekers with employers and opportunities in the construction sector.<\/p>  <p>-  Reforming our system of income support payments.  This includes initiatives that have been progressed by my colleagues in relation to the development of statutory sick pay and the basic income for artists pilot, and steps I have taken to enable people retain welfare payments while pursing higher level programmes of education.<\/p>  <p>  These are just some examples.

Generally participants under 60 years of age can stay on CE for one to three years consecutively, with a maximum 6 years participation.  <\/p><p>The budget for the CE programme in 2022 is &euro;375.3 million.  A total of &euro;326.7million was spent on CE in 2021.<\/p><p>During the COVID pandemic the Minister for Social Protection and I extended CE participants contracts on a number of occasions.  These contract extensions, which were in place from October 2020, supported CE schemes at various stages of the pandemic so that they could maintain important community services while also ensuring that participants had sufficient time to fully avail of the work experience and training opportunities affected by public health restrictions.<\/p><p>Existing CE participants have begun exiting their schemes on a coordinated and phased basis from 8 April 2022 and this will run up until January 2023.  This will ensure continuity of service delivery and also support recruitment of new participants to fill consequential and existing vacancies.<\/p><p>In light of the COVID related challenges faced by CE schemes, Minister Humphreys and I announced a number of changes to CE in December 2021. <\/p><p>The CE baseline year was increased from 2007 to 2014 with immediate effect.  The baseline year will be maintained at 7 years behind the current year going forward i.e. on 1 January 2022, the baseline year moved to 2015.  This will benefit some persons who remain unemployed or once again become unemployed a while after completing a CE scheme, as time spent on schemes prior to the baseline year do not count towards participation limits on CE. <\/p><p>Persons over 60 years of age can now remain on CE until they reach the state pension age regardless of the time limits.  Previously this only applied to persons over 62.<\/p><p>In addition, in order to assist with the transition from COVID emergency supports over the next period, participants, including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, until a suitable replacement has been referred to the scheme. <\/p><p>I will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services while ensuring that places continue to be made available to those who are long term unemployed.  <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700057#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700057#WRB02700"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[24644\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700057#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the circumstances in which recipients of social welfare protections payments can have their payments suspended without prior notice; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>Payments  are only suspended where there is a valid reason for doing so.

The data shows that household incomes across all income deciles have increased and also that income inequality has decreased.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the last number of years, social transfers have performed strongly in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.  This is once again confirmed by the 2021 SILC, which shows that social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 38.6% to 11.6%, or 27 percentage points in absolute terms.  This represents a 70% reduction on the at-risk-of-poverty rate in 2021.  Ireland is consistently one of the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, income and living conditions were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic over the reference period covered by the survey.

A single pensioner living alone has also seen an increase of &euro;21.50 per week during the fuel season.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these Budget measures, the Government has acted quickly and decisively to introduce further targeted measures aimed at offsetting the increased cost of living for social welfare recipients.<\/p>  <p>  In March, a once-off lump sum of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment, at a cost of approximately &euro;49 million.

The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.<\/p><p>The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and set out a wide-range of recommendations, including recommending a full transition to the Total Contributions Approach and the abolition of the Yearly Average approach on a phased basis over a ten year period.  In terms of the specific design of the Total Contributions Approach, the Commission recommended that the current Interim Total Contributions Approach should become the definitive Total Contributions Approach, i.e., 40 years (2,080) contributions required at State Pension age to qualify for a maximum rate pension.  This includes provision for 10 years of PRSI credits and 20 years of HomeCaring periods, but with a cap of 20 years combined PRSI credits and HomeCaring periods.<\/p><p>In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and it is complex.

The purpose of this payment is to assist qualifying households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs.  As part of the overall welfare budget package of &euro;600m in increases secured for 2022, I increased the Fuel Allowance payment by &euro;5 per week effective from Budget night.  I also increased the weekly income threshold for Fuel Allowance by &euro;20 which enables more people to qualify for this support.

Ireland is consistently one of the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers.<\/p><p>The survey results also show that social welfare and COVID-19 income supports were key in sustaining incomes.  Without COVID-19 income supports, average household incomes would have fallen by 6.2%.  As a result of COVID-19 income supports, average household incomes actually increased by 5.2%.  It is particularly welcome that household disposable incomes increased across all income deciles. <\/p><p>The SILC 2021 report also calculated the Gini coefficient, which is a measure of income inequality where a smaller number represents greater income equality.  It found income equality had improved in Ireland (improving from 28.5% in SILC 2020 to 27% in SILC 2021) and that social transfers played a key role in this.  Without social transfers, the Gini coefficient would have been 43.4%. <\/p><p>Combined with the other SILC 2021 findings, the reduction in income inequality displays the effectiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system at both redistributing income and reducing poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700059#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700059#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[24561\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700059#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will clarify what if any provisions her Department has made for dealing or absorbing current LES staff who may lose their positions as a result of the tendering process for those services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>My Department been engaged in the restructuring and procurement of externally contracted employment services since 2019.

In April 2020, the COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate &ndash; which included all those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) &ndash; peaked at 31.5 percent. <\/p>  <p>  However, since the acceleration of the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccination campaign in mid-2021 which facilitated widescale economic and societal reopening, the Irish labour market has been experiencing a sharp recovery.  According to the most recent Labour Force Survey results from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), approximately 2.5 million people were employed in Q4 2021, exceeding the pre-pandemic level.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to unemployment, latest figures from April 2022 indicate that the seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate has now fallen to 4.8 percent.  Similarly, I am pleased to report that youth unemployment rate estimates have been falling month-on-month and are currently at their lowest level in over 20 years at just 5.6 percent.  This is an especially welcome development given the particular initial impact of the pandemic and associated public health restrictions on the employment outcomes and opportunities for our young people.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note also that Ireland&rsquo;s labour force participation rate is also higher than pre-pandemic at 65.1 percent, and in particular, I welcome the marked increase in female participation.  I expect that innovations and lessons learned with respect to the adoption of remote working have significantly contributed to this increase and allowed more people, previously outside of the labour market, to take-up employment.<\/p>  <p>  Following the full lifting of public health restrictions earlier this year, Government&rsquo;s emergency COVID-19 income and employment supports &ndash; the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) &ndash; have gradually been wound down.  Following the PUP payments on 29 March, the transition process to full jobseeker terms for all remaining PUP recipients commenced with the first jobseeker payments, for this cohort, paid on 5 April.  While this has led to an increase in the number of people in receipt of traditional jobseeker's payments, I am pleased to report that Live Register numbers are below their pre-pandemic levels, standing around 175,400 as of the week ending 8 May.<\/p>  <p>  While all of these labour market trends are encouraging, I remain acutely aware of the challenges many people face in regaining their footing in the labour market in the wake of COVID-19, including those who were unemployment prior to the pandemic.  As such, through the Pathways to Work strategy 2021 &ndash; 2025, my Department is actively working to assist all those unemployed find, secure and sustain quality employment so as to ensure that no one is left behind during our economic recovery.  In doing so, we can further improve labour market outcomes for all in the aftermath of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, recent labour market projections from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update published in April project further year-on-year growth in overall employment out to 2025.  However, reflecting the impact of ongoing high inflation on growth as well as the uncertainty around other macro-economic and geopolitical challenges, unemployment is projected to average 5.4 percent over 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700060#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700060#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[24513\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700060#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to reduce deprivation among lone parent families given the increase in deprivation found in the latest EU survey on income and living conditions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of the high levels of poverty and deprivation experienced by lone parent families and that is why Budget 2022 included a number of measures of benefit to lone parents in receipt of a social welfare payment such as One-Parent Family Payment or Jobseeker's Transitional Payment. <\/p>  <p>  In the Budget I provided for a &euro;5 per week increase in social welfare payment rates.

The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory \"Family Carer Register\" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.

As a result, the Government introduced emergency income and employment support measures, namely the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which was later replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  <\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the Government&rsquo;s decision to avoid a cliff edge associated with the sudden removal of supports, it was agreed that these emergency measures would be wound down gradually, the last step of which will be the closure of the EWSS at the end of this month.  The EWSS was designed to maintain linkages between employers and employees.  As of the end of April 257,000 people employees were being supported through this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Analysis conducted in November 2021, published by my Department, shows that, by early October 2021, of the 774,000 people who had exited the PUP, 571,000 - or 74 percent - had evidence of employment.  Of these, 305,000 returned to work, at some stage, with their pre-PUP employer.  In this regard, the PUP scheme was also successful in maintaining links with employers.<\/p>  <p>  These measures helped to ensure that the economy and the labour market was well positioned for the easing of the public health restrictions and the resumption of normal economic activity.  In part as a result of these efforts, the Live Register figure as of May 8th was around 175,400, which is lower than the pre-pandemic levels.  The overall unemployment rate is 4.8 percent and the youth unemployment rate declined significantly and is currently at 5.6 percent.  These indicators are very welcome and signify a strong recovery in the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the emergency Covid measures, as part of the Pathways to Work Strategy 2021-2025, the Government has put in place additional supports to help those who were affected during the pandemic as well as helping those who, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, faced disadvantage in the labour market.  These measures include but are not limited to:<\/p>  <p>-  Expanding the JobsPlus financial incentive for employers.<\/p>  <p>-  Expanding the capacity of the Public Employment Service across the State. <\/p>  <p>--  Launching the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP), which is a 6-month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, for persons out of work for six months or more.<\/p>  <p>-  Ring-fencing at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for long-term unemployed young people.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the comprehensive package of measures that comprise Pathways 2021-2025 will be sufficient to support the labour market as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Government responded quickly by introducing the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) to support incomes for those who were unable to work, and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which was superseded by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), to support businesses and workers affected by the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Over the course of the pandemic, the PUP has supported around 880,000 individuals, paying out over &euro;9 billion.  Following on from the successful vaccination campaign, which enabled the reopening of the economy, the Government agreed to withdraw the emergency Covid supports in a phased manner. <\/p>  <p>  The Department worked with the remaining PUP recipients at the final stages of the winding down of the PUP, to assist eligible jobseekers in their Live Register claim applications.  The first Jobseeker payments for the cohort who remained on the PUP at the end, were paid on 5 April, following the PUP payments on 29 March. <\/p>  <p>  For those who have transitioned from the PUP and applied for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, but whose claim is still being processed by the Department, support will continue to be provided through the PUP until a decision is made regarding their claim.  As of 13 May, there are 130 of these, all of whom are included in the Live Register. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the impact of these schemes, analysis conducted in November 2021, published by my Department shows that, by early October 2021, of the 774,000 people who exited the PUP, 571,000 or 74 percent, have evidence of employment.  Of these, 305,000 returned to work, at some stage, with their pre-PUP employer.  Accordingly, there have been strong exits to employment from the PUP scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the EWSS and PUP were successful in helping maintain the links between businesses and employees.

Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system includes a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods outside of paid employment in the calculation of a State Pension payment.  Details of these are: <\/p>  <p>-  PRSI Credits are awarded to recipients of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.<\/p>  <p>-  The Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for a higher payment rate of State Pension (Contributory).  The scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing a person's Yearly Average.  A homemaker, under the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme, is a person who provides full-time care for either:<\/p>  <p>-  a child under 12; or<\/p>  <p>-  an ill or disabled person aged 12 or over.<\/p>  <p>-  HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years.  Only one person can benefit from a HomeCaring Period for supporting a child or adult at one time.  HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as the Aggregated Contribution Method) of pension calculation.  HomeCaring Periods relate to full-time care for:<\/p>  <p>-  a child or children under the age of 12 years of age;<\/p>  <p>-  a child or children over the age of 12 who needed an increased level of care; or<\/p>  <p>-  an adult who needed an increased level of care.<\/p>  <p>  Foster carers are entitled to the benefits of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme or HomeCaring Periods, on the same basis as other carers, and will qualify if the carer is in receipt of Child Benefit.  If the foster carer is not in receipt of Child Benefit, s\/he can still qualify for the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme or HomeCaring Periods provided the caring periods are confirmed by Tusla.  <\/p>  <p>  Since April 2019, all new State Pension (Contributory) applications are assessed under all possible payment rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the Interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  The Homemaker's Scheme and HomeCaring Periods Scheme cannot be used together to calculate State Pension (Contributory) entitlement.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to examine options for a pension solution for carers, the majority of whom are women, particularly those of incapacitated children, in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them.  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants can be accommodated within the State Pension system.  <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021.  It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  The report set out a wide-range of recommendations, including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers.  It recommended that long-term carers (defined as caring for more than 20 years) should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring.  The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory \"Family Carer Register\" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be considered as part of the Government's deliberations.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700061#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700061#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[24961\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700061#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the measures that are in place to support highly-skilled Ukrainian refugees in accessing the Irish job market; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>My Department is working alongside other relevant departments in supporting access to the labour market and employment for those arriving from Ukraine, under the EU&rsquo;s Temporary Protection Directive.<b><\/b><\/p><p>Intreo employment services are assisting those arriving from Ukraine as they seek employment in Intreo Offices and through jobsireland.ie.

Therefore, grant supports will not be available for stoves or relining chimneys under the SEAI residential energy upgrade schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700062#WRG06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700062#WRG06500"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[24203\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700062#WRG06600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the current average waiting time for the home surveys that are required to access SEAI free energy upgrades.","asker":"1571","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers free energy upgrades for eligible homeowners in low-income households who are most at risk of energy poverty.

In recognition of this, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the Government have provided temporary financial supports for certain licensed commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In acknowledgement of the continuing difficulties facing the sector, these supports have been extended up to 30 June 2022 and to date, over &euro;60 million has been provided to support the commercial bus operators.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, as part of the suite of new measures introduced, a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO public transport services is being made available nationwide until the end of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day. The Government allocated &euro;54m in Exchequer funding to provide this measure; however, this funding does not include an extension of the scheme to commercial operators. As the Deputy will be aware, unlike with PSO services, the National Transport Authority (NTA) does not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators; fares on these services are set by the operators themselves.<\/p>  <p>  However, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) on both PSO and commercial services.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. <\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.<\/p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares.<\/p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. The discount is available on PSO services and will be broadened to include commercial operators as soon as practical.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in light of the NTA's responsibility in the regulation of fares, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific questions  to the NTA for direct reply.

Last year I was delighted to announce the first ever major Active Travel investment programme for rural Ireland, to support sustainable transport projects in 19 local authorities outside the Greater Dublin Area and Regional Cities.  All 19 local authorities have been allocated funding under the 2022 Active Travel Investment Programme and details of the allocations are available at www.nationaltransport.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2022-Active-Travel-Investment-Allocations.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  The overall increase in funding across urban and rural Ireland will not only support the construction and improvement of safe and connected walking and cycling infrastructure but also the deployment of 320 dedicated Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country. In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to Schools Programme last year, which aims to accelerate the delivery of safe walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. It has had a great response, with applications received from schools in every county in Ireland, and extensive engagement has taken place with all 170 schools that have been selected for round 1 of the programme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for Greenways through Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), and funding of circa &euro;60 million has been allocated to around 40 Greenway projects across the country in 2022, in nearly every single county. Greenways are for use by people walking and cycling and also provide an option in rural areas for connections to towns and villages. TII are also, as part of their funding of Active Travel measures, including pedestrian and cycling infrastructure as part of National road construction and renovation works. In addition, a number of regional and local road improvement schemes which are currently under construction or have been recently completed, incorporate provision for cycle tracks and footpaths. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to mention that education is key and this is where the Road Safety Authority (RSA), the agency tasked with road safety education in Ireland, has an important role in reminding everyone of their responsibilities to other road users. The RSA ran a public awareness campaign in 2021 specifically directed at promoting increased safety on rural roads. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700064#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700064#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[24294\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700064#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the Government is considering implementing a congestion charge on private motor vehicles entering Dublin city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>The Climate Action Plan makes clear that we need to reduce fossil fuelled passenger vehicle kilometres by up to 10% to fully achieve a 51% emissions reduction for the transport sector by 2030.

The three priority measures that have been recommended for implementation across the five cities are:<\/p><p>- Developing and embedding the concept of 15-minute neighbourhoods through national and local plans and strategies, providing resources to incentivise their implementation through national funding\/grants schemes.<\/p><p>- Enhancing delivery of the National Planning Framework.<\/p><p>- Public Parking Controls.<\/p><p>Importantly, the Study has also made clear that there is no single solution to tackling the challenges facing our urban environments. Utilising an integrated Travel Demand Management approach to policy development, planning and delivery of our land use and transport systems will be fundamental to addressing these challenges in the coming years.<\/p><p>In line with our Climate Action Plan commitments, my Department, NTA and the Regional Assemblies are engaging to identify a pathway for the implementation of suitable demand management measures at national and local level, and to advancing these measures by 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700064#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700064#WRJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[24296\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700064#WRJ04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department has looked at increasing the frequency of train journeys on the Midleton to Cork line and the Cobh to Cork line; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1452","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. <\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for the scheduling of those services in conjunction with the relevant transport operators, in this case Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's query in relation to increasing the number of train journeys on the Midleton to Cork and Cobh to Cork lines to the NTA for direct reply.

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. <\/p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. <\/p>  <p>  The time lag is due to the fact that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives, such as the YAC, on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. An array of various ticketing equipment is in use on fleet used by the commercial operators and needs to be catered for. To expedite the process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card in as timely a manner as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. <\/p>  <p>  The Government decision did not include broadening this initiative to include commercial bus operators. Unlike with PSO services, the NTA does not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators; the operators themselves set fares on their services based on their own commercial judgement.<\/p>  <p>Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.  In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to the 30th of June 2022. To date over &euro;60m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the estimated percentage increase in demand on public transport services due to the 20% decrease in fares and the youth travel card in advance of introducing these policies along with the modelling used, this would also be a matter for the NTA.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the above, I have forwarded the Deputies specific questions to the NTA for direct reply.

All computer hardware that has passed the end of its useful life is transferred to an approved asset disposal partner for secure reconditioning\/reuse or destruction.<\/p><p>The Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal&rsquo;s protocol in respect of the re-use of computer hardware when it is replaced or upgraded is (i) computer hardware and other technical equipment are kept in use for as long as possible, thereby reducing the consumption of raw materials and impacts harmful to the environment, (ii) the maximum economic value is extracted from computer hardware and technical equipment, and (iii) computer hardware and technical equipment are, where possible, regenerated at the end of their useful life, subject to any steps which must be taken to ensure the deletion and protection of data on that equipment<\/p><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has a Fixed Asset Policy and Procedures in place which includes provision for the re-use of any obsolete computer hardware when it is replaced or upgraded. All policies are reviewed at least annually and any changes identified in the forthcoming Circular Economy and Waste Management (Amendment) Bill 2022, when enacted, will be considered and incorporated as appropriate.<\/p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has a Purchase and Disposal of Assets Policy and Procedure in place which is in line with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. The NTMA seeks to maximise the useful lifetime of computer hardware. When upgraded or replaced, computer hardware is either disposed of in accordance with policy or recycled. All disposal of computer hardware incorporates a secure erase of any data, and where computer hardware is recycled, all such recycling is performed by an accredited service provider. The NTMA is aware of, and is currently reviewing and monitoring progression of the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022. Where applicable, the NTMA will comply with same. The NTMA provides ICT infrastructure to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<\/p><p>When ICT assets reach their end of life, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s policy is that any elements that contain, or have the capacity to hold, data are removed on site for separate certified secure disposal by an appropriately qualified third party service provider. Any remaining equipment is either offered free of charge to a charitable organisation or is conveyed for recycling to a contractor on the Office of Government Procurement recycling framework.<\/p><p>When the Office of the Revenue Commissioners needs to dispose of retired computer hardware, it contracts for the services of a recycling company certified to ISO 14001. The contracted recycling company collects, sorts and recycles the computer equipment and delivers the recovered materials to approved and fully licensed facilities for re-integration into the supply chain. Revenue is satisfied that this is in compliance<i><\/i>with the Circular Economy and Waste Management (Amendment) Bill 2022, specifically the definition in Section 6(c): &ldquo;the goods, products and materials concerned are recovered and regenerated at the end of their useful life&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission forwards all obsolete computer hardware to the Office of Revenue Commissioners, in accordance with an agreed service level agreement, for destruction or re-use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700065#WRK05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700065#WRK05400"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[24102\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700065#WRK05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if, in respect of credit unions his attention has been drawn to the fact that a branch (details supplied) intends to put in place a monthly charge for everyday banking services; and if this charge is found across all credit unions offering current accounts.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, I have no role in the commercial decisions made by any credit union.<\/p><p>Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of individual credit unions.  <\/p><p>Further to this, I continue to engage regularly with credit union representative bodies and stakeholders on matters concerning the wider credit union sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700065#WRK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Industry","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700065#WRK05700"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[24176\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700065#WRK05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way the process to examine the introduction of a levy on the construction industry in the Finance Bill 2022 that was announced on 30 November 2021 as part of his statement on the revised defective concrete block scheme is progressing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is the Government&rsquo;s firm intention to find appropriate solutions for those ordinary home-owners who have been affected by the defective concrete blocks issue. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government reflects this commitment.<\/p>  <p>  That commitment is further reflected in a Government decision taken on 30 November 2021 regarding the Defective Concrete Block Grant Scheme, which agreed a number of actions to help address the defective blocks issue.

Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are focused on targeting and confronting non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection. Resources allocated to these different aspects of enforcement and compliance work are adjusted and realigned in response to changes in the level of risk in different sectors.<\/p>  <p>  I know that Revenue takes an integrated approach to combatting all forms of illegal trade and shadow economy activity, including combatting the illicit tobacco trade. I am advised by Revenue that, in its experience, those involved in the illicit tobacco trade do not necessarily confine themselves to a particular commodity type. As a result, Revenue implements an integrated approach to all forms of illegal trade as distinct from a product or commodity specific focus.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 includes a commitment to confronting non-compliance, including tobacco smuggling. This commitment is given operational priority each year through Revenue&rsquo;s business planning and delivery framework having regard to risk and trends and developments within illegal trades and the modus operandi of those involved. Revenue&rsquo;s actions under these operational plans are designed to maximise coordination and efficiency Revenue-wide and deliver the best impact for the effort involved.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it implements a range of measures to identify and target the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting those involved. Revenue develops and shares intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, and deploys analytics and detection technologies and ensures effective risk focused deployment of resources.<\/p>  <p>  The smuggling of tobacco products has a transnational and cross border dimension and, in addition to Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area, I am advised that Revenue also works closely with its counterparts in other jurisdictions including colleagues in Northern Ireland through the Cross Border Joint Agency Task Force (JATF), and international bodies including OLAF (the EU&rsquo;s anti-fraud agency), Europol and the World Customs Organisation.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue&rsquo;s activities aimed at combatting tobacco smuggling continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This work yielded excellent results and in 2020 Revenue seized 48.1 million illicit cigarettes and approximately 7,100 kgs of illicit tobacco while in 2021 Revenue seized over 60 million illicit cigarettes and 38,246 kgs of illicit tobacco. For this year, to the end of April Revenue has seized 9.67 million illicit cigarettes and 1,493 kgs of illicit tobacco.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has ensured through the Finance Acts over recent years that Revenue has the necessary statutory powers to enable it to deliver on its key functions. I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for undertaking and continuing the important work against the illegal tobacco trade.

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee. <\/p>  <p>  Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment.<\/p>  <p>  Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the Cycle to Work scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement certain conditions must be met, for example:<\/p>  <p>  - The exemption applies to the first &euro;1,250 of expenditure incurred by the employer in obtaining a bicycle and related safety equipment. This exemption limit is increased to &euro;1,500 for pedelecs or ebikes and related safety equipment. Employers may incur costs in excess of these limits, but any such excess will not qualify for the exemption and will be liable to tax. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same monetary limits.<\/p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer. <\/p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.<\/p>  <p>  - An employee or director can only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 4 year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12 month period<\/p>  <p>  The Cycle to Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment. Thus, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of self-employed individuals, students, retired individuals, job seekers or those in unpaid work, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. Likewise, salary sacrifice arrangements may only be entered into between an employer and a director or employee.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the cycle to work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of its particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers.

This is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan ambitions to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. The annual breakdown of these receipts was provided in reply to PQ No.78 of 10 November 2021.  Further details were provided in response to PQ No.172 of 18 November 2021 and PQ NO.68 of 24 November 2021 in relation to the methodology behind this calculation. <\/p>  <p>  These projections for carbon tax receipts are based on a declining carbon tax base reflecting changing behaviour in response to the tax, amongst other factors. These estimates were based upon official projections from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published, in June 2021 which represented an independent assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions trajectory to 2030. Specifically the estimates are based on the EPA&rsquo;s non-ETS (EU Emissions Trading System) &lsquo;WAM&rsquo;, or with additional measures scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, which includes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a &euro;100 per tonne carbon tax by 2030. Currently, the EPA has not published an alternative emissions scenario that incorporates doubling the carbon tax rate in the manner suggested by the Deputy. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the impact on carbon tax receipts in a similar manner to previous calculations. <\/p>  <p>  For straight line estimates on tax rate increases Revenue&rsquo;s Ready Reckoner includes estimates for the yield from changes in duties on Carbon Tax on page 23.

The Department has an appointed Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who works closely with the National Disability Authority to ensure that the Department is fully compliant with its obligations under the Act. All reasonable accommodation requests by staff with disabilities have been expedited fully and promptly. <\/p>  <p>  In addition in 2016-17, a major refurbishment project was undertaken in Government Buildings on Merrion Street. As part of that project, for example, electronic doors were installed to assist the movement of staff across the campus. In 2019, an external lift was installed to South Block to allow staff and visitors with mobility difficulties to access the building easier, to ensure compliance in respect of accessibility.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s website (www.gov.ie\/finance.ie), internal intranet and the Build to Share programmes, such as ePQ, eSubmission, and eCorrespondence, which are used by staff in the course of their work, all have software to aid the visually impaired. A &lsquo;loop&rsquo; system&rsquo; is in place in the Department&rsquo;s main Conference Room for the hearing impaired.<\/p>  <p>  The Department regularly holds &ldquo;Power Hours&rdquo;, which are awareness presentations for staff in the areas of Autism and Dyslexia in the Workplace and supports the annual International Day of People with Disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the bodies under the aegis of my Department as follows:<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is committed to meeting its obligations under the Employment Equality Acts.  One of the five focus areas of the Bank&rsquo;s three-year disability action plan is on its approach to providing reasonable accommodations and practical supports. Colleagues at any time can seek referral to the Bank&rsquo;s occupational health specialist via their manager where accommodations can be requested.  Similarly, a manager can request additional support for an employee if they feel it will be helpful or important to do so. The Bank works in partnership with its employee-led networks, and in particular the BankAbility Network, to help create an environment where employees will feel comfortable to disclose their disability in order to provide the support and\/or accommodations they may require. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank assesses ergonomic requirements\/reasonable accommodations, some direct to Health and Safety and others through occupational health assessment. Any reasonable accommodations advised to the Bank during pre-employment screening, or following a medical absence, or at any time, are considered and supported. These are communicated to the individual and their manager and are monitored through regular engagement. The Bank communicates in all job adverts and on its careers website that it is an equal opportunities employer and that it will make any reasonable accommodations necessary throughout each stage of the recruitment process.  The Bank launched a bespoke Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Learning Offering in 2022 for all staff, with a focus on core concepts such as equality, equity and unconscious bias, actionable tips for working and managing inclusively including creating awareness around its approach for making reasonable accommodations. The Bank&rsquo;s headquarters on North Wall Quay has won national and international awards for its accessibility. Embedding universal design has created a better environment for all employees and visitors. This approach has reduced the need to facilitate reasonable accommodations retrospectively on a more expensive case-by-case basis. <\/p>  <p>  Some examples of accommodations within the last twelve months include (i) Sign language Interpreting services for job interviews and meetings, (ii) Additional ergonomic assessment and equipment to enhance the physical workspace in the office or while working from home, (iii) Adaptations or modifications of work tasks, management styles, instruction and communication of information, and (iv) Assistive Technology e.g. screen reading software, screen magnification and voice activated software. The Bank continues to provide support for employees in high risk categories to work from home over the course of the pandemic. It also supported those with additional needs by providing extra IT and office equipment and furniture and accommodating specific work needs. For those in these categories who may now be preparing to return to the office, there is engagement with managers to understand what supports may be required, with specialist advice for occupational health being provided to ensure the right support and accommodations can be provided.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank assigns staff to the Investor Compensation Company DAC, which is also a body under my Department's remit.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) fully recognises its obligations and responsibilities with regards to the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 and the Disability Act 2005, and is committed to enabling access to employment for persons from minority and\/or disadvantaged communities, including persons with disabilities. The FSPO operates its recruitment campaigns in compliance with the Codes of Practice for Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service and is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for prospective candidates. We encourage applications under all nine grounds of the Employment Equality Acts and offer reasonable accommodation to current and prospective employees with disabilities, in accordance with the Acts. The FSPO has an appointed Access Officer who is responsible for ensuring appropriate measures are put in place to enable employees with a disability to carry out their work on an equal footing with other employees. In addition, a staff census undertaken in 2021 indicated that at 6.45%, the FSPO exceeded the minimum requirement set out in the Disability Act 2005 in relation to the level of employment of people with disabilities, which demonstrates that its policies have been effective in reaching and maintaining the targets set out in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for Persons with Disabilities. The FSPO continues to enhance practices in this area and has emphasised the requirement to achieve an inclusive and diverse workplace over the course of the next strategic period.  <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an equal opportunities employer. Its Recruitment Policy and Procedures outline equality of opportunity at the Fiscal Council, articulating that rights under the Employment Equality Acts are guaranteed and that no one will receive less favourable treatment and can be assured of equality of participation in the workplace and that all employees have a responsibility to create a working environment in which differences are respected. The Fiscal Council is aware of obligations for reasonable accommodation under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015. This is achieved by affording an individual with a disability equal participation in the recruitment process.  Reasonable accommodations will be implemented which may be required in respect of changes to the tasks and structure of a position, or to make changes to the workplace environment to enable an individual with disabilities to commence employment or to return to employment having acquired a disability to ensure that they can enjoy benefits and privileges accorded to other employees.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has been proactive in making reasonable accommodations to the specific needs of individuals through a number of means including, but not limited to, purchasing of additional software, hardware and modifications to work stations, modifications to roles, duties and working hours, as well as ensuring our policies, processes, initiatives and facilities provide and support an inclusive working environment. The NTMA assesses the above needs when disclosed upon joining and throughout an individual&rsquo;s employment.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with a Service Level Agreement, the NTMA assigns staff to three further bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis; these are Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General takes all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of persons with disabilities and to meet its obligations for reasonable accommodations under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015. Each employee is asked to complete a Disability Status form as part of their induction into the Office. All employees are given access to this form via the Office intranet and may also submit this form at any time during employment should a disability develop or come to light.  A DLO is in place to support staff with a disability employed by the Office. Staff with a disability requiring a reasonable accommodation will contact the disability liaison officer who will arrange to put the accommodation in place.  In addition to specific individual requests for reasonable accommodations, the Office has a range of items available to assist staff with a disability.  These include sit-stand desks and scanner pens which read text aloud once scanned over an electronic document. Aids are also available for the hearing-impaired which can be linked to telephone extension numbers. Other items, such as larger monitors for the visually impaired or specialised chairs for back conditions are purchased by the Office on a case by case basis. The Office is also fully wheelchair accessible.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners, as an equal opportunities employer, is strongly committed to the development and implementation of measures to promote and support the employment of individuals with disabilities. They observe and promote the &ldquo;Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disability in the Civil Service&rdquo; which applies to the employment of people with a disability across the Civil Service. During the recruitment process and via regular communications thereafter, staff are encouraged to indicate if they have any needs for reasonable accommodation related to a disability. Revenue has three DLOs who provide assistance and information to support employees who may require workplace accommodations. All Revenue employees are regularly kept informed of supports available. Consultations with the DLOs are strictly confidential, and personal or medical information is not shared. Revenue is committed to providing workplace accommodations to staff with disabilities on an individual needs basis, including assistive technology, office equipment, interpretation services, mentoring, training, facilitating attendance at medical appointments, flexible working hours, work sharing arrangements and shorter working hours. These measures are put in place in consultation with the staff member. In some instances, in particular with non-visible disabilities, medical advice is sought from the CMO. The vast majority of Revenue buildings countrywide are adapted for use by those with physical disabilities, and access audits are available on request in any Revenue location. Revenue public offices are accessible and adapted for use by the public and in particular by those with a disability. <\/p>  <p>  All Revenue employees are treated equally with training and promotion opportunities available to all staff. Furthermore, Revenue offers paid internships for persons with disabilities such as the Specialisterne Ireland and the Association for Higher Education Access &amp;amp; Disability (AHEAD) Willing Able and Mentoring (WAM) Programmes. Specialisterne Ireland is a not-for-profit company and a registered Charity that promotes employment opportunities for people with autism and similar challenges. Specialisterne Ireland, through its employer partnerships, arranges for its candidates to be recruited through an autism friendly process. The WAM Programme serves to widen access to employment for those with disabilities and create attitudinal change and opportunities for further employment. I am advised by Revenue that in recognition of their significant contribution to the WAM programme, they received a &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; award at the Building for the Future\/Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) Awards in 2017 and they continue to actively participate in this initiative. Finally, in line with Revenue&rsquo;s mission to ensure an accessible, respectful and fair environment for its staff, Revenue conducted a staff survey in May 2021 which included the collection of information on the diverse composition of their workforce. This survey included questions relating to gender, including binary and transgender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnic\/cultural background and citizenship.  Revenue notes that responses from this survey will enable them to better understand, anticipate and respond to the needs of their staff. <\/p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission currently has no staff that require reasonable accommodation but is aware of its obligations under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015. However, if the Commission was notified by the Government&rsquo;s Public Appointments Service that an additional staff member was joining the organisation with reasonable accommodation requirements, it would gather all the necessary information and contact the individual in advance of their commencement to ensure the most reasonable working conditions were acceptable by all parties involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[24319\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of category A vehicles that were charged with the nitrogen dioxide emissions levy in 2021 and 2022; the revenue raised each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[24320\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised if the current nitrogen dioxide levy was doubled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[24321\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised annually if the current nitrogen dioxide levy was applied to both category A and B vehicles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 to 257, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the table below provides the number of category A vehicles that were charged the nitrogen dioxide emissions levy in 2021 and to the end of April in 2022, as well as the revenue raised in each of these years.

The legal obligation to freeze funds and economic resources (including bank accounts) is placed on economic operators such as credit and financial institutions. <\/p>  <p>  The EU sanctions regulations provide for a limited number of derogations under which frozen funds can be released. As part of its role as a Competent Authority for sanctions, the Central Bank is responsible for the assessment of derogation applications. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is fully engaging with all applicants for derogations. I am sure you will appreciate that as derogations are designed to allow the release of funds that should otherwise be frozen, a robust assessment of applications is required to ensure that any authorisation of a derogation does not undermine the purpose of the sanctions. Therefore, the assessment of derogations is complex and it requires establishing with certainty that the applicant is legally entitled to the requested derogation. Unfortunately, this may be time consuming in some cases. <\/p>  <p>  I am sympathetic to the situation in which your constituent finds himself. However, I can confirm that the Central Bank is actively assessing all derogation applications it has received and continually liaises and provides feedback directly to the applicants throughout the course of the assessment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[24719\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700066#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an organisation (details supplied) can receive an exemption or rebate on VAT payable on tools, materials and electricity; if commercial rates will be waived for the organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":554,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the application of VAT to the supply of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. An entity is required to register for VAT where they make taxable supplies which exceed certain thresholds. Once VAT-registered, it is generally entitled to claim a refund of the VAT it has incurred on its various inputs and business cost. In accordance with the VAT Directive an entity that is not registered for VAT generally is not entitled to reclaim VAT they have incurred on the purchase of goods and services. <\/p>  <p>  It is a fundamental feature of the EU and national VAT arrangements that the liability to VAT depends on the nature of the goods and services being supplied and it does not differ according to the circumstances of a particular customer or purchaser. There is no provision under European or Irish VAT legislation to exempt the supply of tools, materials or electricity to a particular organisation such as the one the Deputy is enquiring about.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may wish to note that, alongside the VAT system, there is a grant scheme in place under which bodies which are qualifying charities may qualify for a grant in recognition of the VAT they have incurred. The VAT Compensation Scheme was introduced to reduce the tax burden on Charities by partially compensating them for the VAT incurred in delivering on their charitable purpose. Under the scheme, Charities may apply for a grant related to a proportion of their VAT costs, based on their level of funding other than from public funds and certain other sources. In order to be a qualifying charity for the scheme, an organisation would need to be registered with the Revenue Commissioners and hold a charitable tax exemption under section 207 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and be registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority. A fund of &euro;5m is available annually under the Scheme. Where the eligible applications in a year exceed the capped amount of the fund, grants are paid to the qualifying charities on a pro rata basis. Detailed information regarding the VAT Compensation Scheme for Charities is available on the Revenue Commissioners website at the following link:<\/p>  <p>www.revenue.ie\/en\/companies-and-charities\/charities-and-sports-bodies\/vat-compensation-scheme\/vat-compensation-scheme-for-charities\/index.aspx<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy has also asked about the possibility of a waiver of commercial rates.

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.<\/p><p>In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and doors and heating upgrades, specifically the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works. The installation of gas\/oil boilers are no longer supported under the energy efficiency programme funded by my Department.<\/p><p>An annualised breakdown of the funding provided and the number of properties upgraded under the Energy Efficiency Retrofit programme for the years 2013-2021 is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output\/.<\/i><\/p><p>Earlier this year, my Department announced that funding of &euro;85 million will be provided for the upgrade of approximately 2,400 social homes in 2022. Each local authority received an individual allocation along with a minimum target of homes they are required to retrofit.

The actual cost of retrofitting works on each home will depend on its pre-works BER but can be as low as &euro;16,350 in some cases. Targets set and funding allocated to local authorities under the new programme calls for local authorities to undertake a variety of house types, from those requiring minimal investment to those requiring major investment, in order to achieve the B2\/Cost Optimal BER. Local authorities are asked to ensure that the average cost per home drawn down under the programme is circa &euro;36,000, including project management fees. Adhering to this average will ensure that the maximum number of homes can be retrofitted with the available budget.<\/p><p>Work in relation to the 2022 programme is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department.

They will provide a comprehensive national overview of projected delivery of affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority and Approved Housing Body delivery of affordable housing, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), previously known as the Serviced Sites Fund, and the Cost Rental Equity Loan. <\/p>  <p>  My Department received an AHF application in February 2022 from Cork County Council for AHF subsidy to support four housing schemes with affordable housing provision, two of which are situated in Clonakilty, with one each in Kinsale and Mallow. A number of essential clarifications on these applications were sought during the assessment process.  The Housing Agency has advised my Department that their assessment of the eligibility of these projects will be concluded shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700069#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":769,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700069#WRO01900"},{"type":"question","counter":770,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[24932\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700069#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":771,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to question No. 75 of 5 May 2022 which sets out the position in the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700069#WRO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":773,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700069#WRO02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Neutrality","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700069#WRO02200"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[24111\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700069#WRO02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position of Ireland in relation to participation in EU battlegroups; the missions participated in by Ireland to date; if such missions require a UN mandate, approval by the Government and approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>EU Battlegroups are multinational, military units which form part of the European Union's military rapid reaction capacity. <\/p>  <p>  They are designed to provide the European Union with a rapid response capability which can be deployed in support of crisis management or humanitarian operations under the European Union's Common Security and Defence Policy, and in support of United Nations mandated missions. <\/p>  <p>  At EU level, the deployment of an EU Battlegroup is subject to a unanimous decision by the Council.

These applications include:<\/p>  <p>  - All Passport Express applications - Section 9 Certificate of Identity<\/p>  <p>  - First time adult online applications - Identity Verification Form<\/p>  <p>  - First time child online applications - Child Passport Identity and Consent Form (Guardian A)<\/p>  <p>  The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of an application for a minor the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child. In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature.<\/p>  <p>  It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing Garda to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the Passport Service calls at a later date the signature can be verified.<\/p>  <p>  There are a small number of cases where the Passport Service has difficulty contacting a Garda station in order to verify the Garda's signature. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact the Garda station in these cases, unfortunately the passport application may be delayed. In some cases, the applicant may be requested to submit a new witnessed form where the Passport Service has been unable to contact the Garda station. The Passport Service will only request a new witness form after multiple attempts have been made to contact the Garda station.<\/p>  <p>  A new document management system that was put in place at the beginning of March is ensuring that these applications which require further documents are being turned around within 15 working days of receipt of the additional documents.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the experience of the Passport Service that failure to contact Garda stations to verify witnesses is a widespread issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is continuously looking at ways to make the application process easier for applicants and advises during the online application process to make sure that the identity and consent form is correctly witnessed once they have completed the online process.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service provides instructions on how to correctly complete these forms on the Department's website (www.dfa.ie\/passports\/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed\/) and is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Passport Service maintains a close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service published a full-page informational advertisement in the April and May editions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s magazine, the Garda Review, to assist Garda&iacute; with the process of witnessing passport identity and consent forms.

The human rights violations, crackdowns on opposition voices and independent media, and backsliding on democratic norms that have been observed in Nicaragua since 2018, and which have intensified since the November 2021 elections, are unacceptable and deeply alarming. <\/p>  <p>  The expulsion of dozens of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) from the country, as well as the expulsion of international human rights bodies and the recent expulsion of the Organisation of American States, is also extremely worrying, and constitute further examples of Nicaragua&rsquo;s withdrawal from the global rules-based order.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU partners, has urged the Nicaraguan authorities to put an end to all repression and restore full respect for human rights, including by allowing the return of international human rights bodies and NGOs to Nicaragua, and to release political prisoners. We will continue to do so by all means possible, through our engagement in Dublin, at EU level, and on the ground through our Embassy in Mexico, which covers Nicaragua, and the EU Delegation in Managua.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland fully supports the EU sanctions in place on various individuals and entities that are responsible for serious human rights violations in Nicaragua. Ireland is prepared to support any additional EU measures that are aimed at supporting democratic norms and human rights in Nicaragua and that do not impact negatively on the population.<\/p>  <p>  From 2012 to 2021, Ireland provided just under &euro;12 million in funding to Nicaragua, reflecting the solidarity of the Irish people with the people of Nicaragua.

The Disability Liaison Officer also takes part in Training events throughout the year to highlight the supports available for officers with a disability. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, as part of my Department's efforts to create a more inclusive and supportive workplace for officers with a disability, the Department rolled out Disability Awareness Training in 2021, which consists of 11 modules covering a broad range of topics, including Mental Health, Hidden Disabilities, Sensory Conditions and Wheelchair Etiquette, amongst others. <\/p>  <p>  Under the remit of the Department's Management Board Sub-Committee on Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, there is a Social Inclusion and Disability Working Group which aims to champion and celebrate social inclusion and disability in the Department of Foreign Affairs.

In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  While, it is critically important to support a summer based programme in our special schools and special classes, it is also essential to ensure that the children with complex special educational needs (SEN) who are in our mainstream settings also have access to this critical support.  At the time when the &lsquo;July Provision&rsquo; was established, the concert of learning loss during school holidays was something which may have been considered to impact only those students in special schools and special classes. As our system has become more inclusive and many of these children with more complex needs now attend mainstream settings, it is recognised that they too will be impacted by school holidays and require that additional support to ensure they achieve their potential.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.<\/p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include: <\/p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools. <\/p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes. <\/p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers. <\/p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes. <\/p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced  capitation for special schools and classes.<\/p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.<\/p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years, we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes. Planning for the 2023 Summer Programme is due to commence shortly, this process will including consultation with Education Partners and stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700073#WRS03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1008,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700073#WRS04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1009,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[24171\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700073#WRS04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the timeline for the completion of the purchase of a building (details supplied) in order that the school can expedite the project in order to open the ASD class in September 2022; if her Department will expedite the project; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1010,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the acquisition process is at an advanced stage for Booterstown Parish Hall.

Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Where reasonable progress is not made, following a school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, a psychologist will become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the school to which the Deputy refers, in this instance the assigned NEPS psychologist is currently on maternity leave. The school continues to have access to NEPS for critical incident support, for regional support and development service and also to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries, through the local NEPS office.  In relation to a casework service, the school may access a casework service, where there is need, via psychologists on the SCPA panel. The local NEPS office is available to discuss any other requirements the school may have. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the other schools to which the Deputy refers, they each have an assigned NEPS psychologist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700074#WRT05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1075,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[24568\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700074#WRT05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the thousands of parents who have children living with a disability that will not be able to avail of the July provision summer programme despite being eligible; her views on the need for a review and update of the current conditions, which needs to include consultations with families regarding their needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1076,"content":"<p>Earlier this month, the Government announced this year's Summer Programme to allow all primary and post-primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  The programme aims are to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for those who are at key transition stages, helping to ensure they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further\/higher education or training.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the 2021 programme, all primary and post primary schools can offer a summer programme and in line with last year&rsquo;s funding, there is up to &euro;40 million available to provide for this year&rsquo;s programme. In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.<\/p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include: <\/p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools. <\/p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes. <\/p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers. <\/p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.<\/p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.<\/p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years, we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes. Planning for the 2023 Summer Programme is due to commence shortly with a view to making further enhancements of supports which will including consultation with Education Partners and stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700074#WRT05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700074#WRT06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[24642\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700074#WRT06100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when an SNA (details supplied) will receive pay increments; and if any further information is required by the Department to progress this application.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1079,"content":"<p>An application per Circular 139\/2006 for incremental credit relating to prior relevant service has been received in my Department from this individual mentioned.

As a result the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. <\/p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021\/2022 school year. Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism. <\/p><p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, over the last two year, the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, already opened nationwide for the 2021\/22 school-year. <\/p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. <\/p><p>The Department and the NCSE continue to prioritise and support this work.<\/p><p>The Department also recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can be a stressful experience. The Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.  <\/p><p>The Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools who express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities. <\/p><p>There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  <\/p><p>The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022\/2023 school year and beyond. The NCSE is looking at local information in relation to projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs. <\/p><p>NCSE have been working with stakeholders in the counties referenced by the Deputy for a number of years to meet the identified need in the county.  SENOs are currently engaged with parents, schools and Boards of Management in these counties to establish the level of need and to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place to meet that need. <\/p><p>I should also state that Budget 2022 has provided funding to the Department and the NCSE for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022\/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places this year.

This will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 by the end of 2022. This represents an increase of 81% in SNA numbers since 2011 when 10,575 SNAs were working in our schools. <\/p>  <p>  The availability of SNAs is critical to the inclusion of students with significant care needs in education and in school life.  <\/p>  <p>  SNAs carry out very important care functions for children with care needs in the school.  The purpose of their role is to enable children with significant care needs to attend school and participate in school activities to the maximum possible extent.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the SNAs in the classroom is to address the immediate physical care needs of the student and encourage their independence.

This is a key principle underlying Department policy on special education. The allocation system must be objective and fair with the capacity to take account of local and individual circumstances.   A core recommendation of the NCSE's Review of the SNA scheme (2018) concerned a change in the way that SNAs are allocated to mainstream classes in both primary and post primary schools. It also called for the greater proportion of SNAs in these classes to be allocated on the basis of a profile of each school before the commencement of the school year in a similar manner to the allocation of SETs.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in terms of the SNA allocation for the school year 2022\/2023.

This ensured that schools were aware of their teaching resources and this allowed them to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that the teaching and learning needs for pupils with SEN can be properly supported. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has also provided guidance and support to schools to assist them in ensuring that the resources being provided are best managed to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. The support includes training and advice from special education professionals within the NCSE as part of the NCSE regional support teams.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) are also available to support schools and teachers  in providing a Continuum of Support to their students with SEN.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700075#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":1117,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700075#WRU03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1118,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[24861\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700075#WRU03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on the report on the surveys regarding parental preferences on primary school patronage; if locations have been considered; if an area (details supplied) will be considered; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1469","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1119,"content":"<p>Palmerstown\/Ballyfermot\/Chapelizod\/Cherry Orchard was one of 43 areas surveyed as part of the patronage divesting process in 2013.

The payment is a contribution towards heating costs, it is not intended to meet these costs in full. The payment is made over the winter season at the weekly rate of &euro;33.00 or, if preferred, by way of two lump sum payments. Only one Fuel Allowance is payable per household. Those who qualify for the payment do not need to reapply annually. <\/p>  <p>  As at the end of December 2021, there were 374,861 Fuel Allowance recipients. At the end of 2020, the number of recipients was 375,269 and at the end of 2019, it was 369,255. Precise information on the number of fuel allowance applications received or disallowed is not readily available. Common disallowance reasons include where the means of the customer or household exceeds the permissible threshold; the applicant resides with a non-qualified person (for example, someone in employment); or the applicant resides with another person who is already in receipt of fuel allowance. Where an application is disallowed, it is open to the person to re-apply if there is a change in their circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced additional expenditure measures of &euro;505 million.

The purpose of this is to maintain the policy of ensuring that social welfare expenditure is targeted to those who need it most.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment of means can vary from scheme to scheme depending on the nature and purpose of the scheme.  Sometimes, a certain amount of income, or income from particular sources, is not taken into account for a particular scheme.  This is known as an income disregard.<\/p>  <p>  For both Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension, capital is assessed as part of the means test.  Capital assessed includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. The family home is not included in the means assessment.<\/p>  <p>  The Department uses an assessment formula, which is set out in legislation, to calculate a person's weekly means from capital.  For Blind Pension, and most other social assistance schemes, the formula is as follows: the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.<\/p>  <p>  For Disability Allowance, the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.<\/p>  <p>  The Blind Pension is a means-tested payment paid to blind and visually impaired people.  It is unique in the social protection system as it is a payment provided to people with a specific physical impairment.  As such, it contains different eligibility and means assessment criteria to Disability Allowance.  Unlike Disability Allowance, recipients of Blind Pension may also qualify for a range of other primary schemes such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Illness Benefit, and One-Parent Family Payment. <\/p>  <p>  Both schemes are structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or insurable employment. <\/p>  <p>  In the means test, both schemes have an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. Earnings above &euro;350 are currently assessed at 100%. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the means test, Budget 2022 measures will see the following changes effective from June:<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the upper disregard of &euro;25 per week, from &euro;350 to &euro;375 for both payments<\/p>  <p>  - An increase of &euro;5.10 being applied to the general weekly means disregard entry point for the Disability Allowance. This increase will bring the entry point of the weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance in line with that of the Blind Pension, at &euro;7.60 per week.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation does not provide for a disregard for funding from grants for artists and as such, any awards made through these types of schemes are assessed as income in the means test.

A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory). As the actuarial value of the State Pension is currently estimated at approximately &euro;380,000, it is reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the term of their working life.<\/p>  <p>  While it was lower in the past when PRSI coverage was less widespread, legislation was introduced in 1997 to increase this threshold to 520 weeks, or 10 years of contributions. A fifteen year period was allowed pass between that legislation being enacted and the threshold being raised to this level, which would have been sufficient for most people to achieve the required contributions.<\/p>  <p>  The social welfare system is primarily a contingency-based system, with entitlement based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood.<\/p>  <p>  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions. Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons. PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life. For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s\/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory). While it is means-tested, there are very significant disregards which are to the benefit of claimants, and a significant majority of such pensioners are paid at the full rate. Alternatively, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent (e.g. a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is financially dependent upon him\/her), who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State Pension (Contributory) in his\/her own right. The payment rate for the IQA is up to 90% of a full contributory pension. The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  As the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland, the State Pension is very effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.

I value the informed views and opinions of these organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware of the challenges facing low-income households as a result of the recent increases in consumer prices. These increases, which are mainly due to external factors, have exceeded even the highest forecasts.<\/p>  <p>  The Government acted early and did not await a further budget cycle to address these challenges. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced a package of measures in February, which will have a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country. This package will cost in excess of half a billion euro.<\/p>  <p>  This package included a lump sum of &euro;125 to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment, which was paid to social welfare recipients in March. This week, a further lump sum payment of &euro;100 will be paid to these households.<\/p>  <p>  Taken together with the &euro;5 increase in Fuel Allowance announced as part of Budget 2022, this means that low-income households will see an increase of 55% in Fuel Allowance support provided during this Fuel season when compared to last season. <\/p>  <p>  A recipient household which would have received &euro;735 in fuel season 2020\/2021 will see an increase of &euro;404 to &euro;1,139 in Fuel Allowance payments in fuel season 2021\/2022.  When taken in conjunction with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, such households will have received over &euro;600 in additional targeted Government supports over the course of this fuel season.  &euro;600 is the equivalent of over 18 weeks' additional fuel allowance at current rates.<\/p>  <p>  The increase of &euro;10 to the weekly income threshold of the Working Family Payment was also brought forward, taking effect from early April 2022 rather than from June.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to those introduced as part of Budget 2022, which included the largest social welfare Budget package in 14 years.  In January, around 1.4 million people received a &euro;5 increase in weekly payments, and more if they have dependents. Targeted, evidence-based measures such as increases to Fuel Allowance, the Living Alone Allowance and Qualified Child payments have ensured the largest increases are aimed at the most vulnerable.

The most recent survey results (SILC 2021) were published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on 6 May 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020&ndash;2025 is the national strategy for poverty reduction and social inclusion.  The ambitious headline target is to reduce the percentage of the population in consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2025. <\/p>  <p>  SILC 2021 shows that there have been improvements across the key national poverty indicators.  The rate of consistent poverty decreased by a 0.7 percentage points to 4%.  Government welcomes this steady progress towards meeting the national social target for poverty reduction.  In addition, child poverty decreased significantly &ndash; from 7.2% in SILC 2020 to 5.2% in SILC 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Data from SILC 2021 highlights the protective effect that social transfers have on poverty.  Without social transfers, the at risk of poverty rate would have been 38.6%.  Social transfers reduced this rate to 11.6%.  This represents a 70% reduction on the at risk of poverty rate in 2021.  Ireland is consistently one of the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers.<\/p>  <p>  The survey results also show that social welfare and COVID-19 income supports were key in sustaining incomes.  Without COVID-19 income supports, average household incomes would have fallen by 6.2%.  As a result of COVID-19 income supports, average household incomes actually increased by 5.2%.  It is particularly welcome that household disposable incomes increased across all income deciles. <\/p>  <p>  The SILC 2021 report also calculated the Gini coefficient, which is a measure of income inequality out of 100 and where a smaller number represents greater income equality.  It found income equality had improved in Ireland, from 28.5 in SILC 2020 to 27 in SILC 2021, and that social transfers played a key role in this.  Without social transfers, the Gini coefficient would have been 43.4.<\/p>  <p>  Combined with the other SILC 2021 findings, the reduction in income inequality displays the effectiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system at both redistributing income and reducing poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The survey results will be incorporated into our annual reporting on progress against targets set out in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion.  It is very positive to see the improvements across key poverty indicators, but I am aware of the higher levels of poverty for certain groups, such as people with disabilities and lone parents.  The continued implementation of Roadmap commitments is key to ensuring a reduction in poverty for all segments in society.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues as we strive for further improvements across the key national poverty indicators, ensuring continued support for those most at risk of poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":1308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1309,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[24944\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons who applied for a public services card in 2021 and to date in 2022.","asker":"1514","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1310,"content":"<p>Public Services Cards (PSC) are produced following the authentication of a person's identity via the SAFE registration process.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.  Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. <\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter, which will then be considered by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation foster care will form part of this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":1314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1315,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[24118\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX04000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will respond to matters raised in correspondence (details supplied); if he will meet with this organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1316,"content":"<p>The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme is an area-based prevention and early intervention initiative which is delivered in 12 areas of significant socioeconomic disadvantage across the country through Tusla&rsquo;s Prevention Partnership and Family Support (PPFS) services. <\/p>  <p>  The ABC Programme aims to work in partnership with families, practitioners, communities and national stakeholders to deliver better outcomes for children and families living in areas where poverty is deeply entrenched.<\/p>  <p>  The ABC Programme was previously funded jointly by Atlantic Philanthropies and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs from 2013 to 2018. My Department tasked Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services to manage the programme, with Pobal being responsible for governance and financial accountability.  <\/p>  <p>  Between 2013 and 2018, ABC organisations operated on three-year contracts with multi-annual budgets. During this time, Pobal gave approval for individual ABC organisations to carry over a certain amount of unspent funds, resulting in an increased yearly spend. In 2018, the ABC Programme transitioned to Tusla and since October of that year, it has operated as part of the wider Tusla PPFS programme. <\/p>  <p>  Since transitioning to Tusla, the practice of the retention of unspent funds has been changed in line with public financial guidance. However, this long standing practice amongst some ABCs has resulted in a shortfall between annual spending and funding received from Tusla. This is due to timing issues and established practices that had existed in ABCs prior to the transition.   <\/p>  <p>  To address this shortfall, Tusla adjusted its PPFS budgets in 2021 to avoid the need for a reduction in funding. As a result, the 4% budget increase for community organisations in 2022, will not be extended to ABCs directly. Instead, this funding will go towards the overall ABC Programme budget to ensure the future viability of the programme going forward. <\/p>  <p>  As an independent state agency, Tusla is responsible for the management and oversight of exchequer funding allocated to it, including funding provided to the ABC Programme.

On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 17 of the report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection was that a State inquiry into illegal adoptions (broadly defined) should be established on a non-statutory basis. <\/p>  <p>  The question of creating an effective non-statutory inquiry is a sensitive, complex and challenging one.  The Special Rapporteur acknowledges this and, in particular, notes the challenges associated with access to records for a non-statutory inquiry.  <\/p>  <p>The Government remains committed to delivering on the comprehensive suite of actions set out in the Government Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions. These actions respond to the priority needs and wishes of survivors, their families and advocates, and many of the actions achieve the objectives of a Truth Commission as proposed by the Special Rapporteur. In March of this year, Government approved high-level proposals for a National Centre for Research and Remembrance.  The National Centre will stand as a site of conscience and will be designed to be an enduring and educational memorial to honour all those who were resident in Industrial Schools, Mother and Baby Homes, Magdalen Laundries and related institutions. The National Centre will be located on the site of the former Magdalen Laundry in Sean MacDermott Street in Dublin city centre and will have an inclusive, national and global reach.<\/p>  <p>  The Centre will comprise a number of distinct, yet interrelated, areas, including a museum and exhibition space, the development of which will be led by the National Museum of Ireland; and a place for reflection and remembrance. In addition, it will contain a research centre and central repository of records related to institutional trauma in the 20th century, which will form part of the National Archives. It is anticipated that the central repository will sit at the heart of the Centre and will ultimately be underpinned by legislation. One unique aspect of the central repository will be the intended inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors; allowing the lived experiences of survivors to be formally accepted as part of the official record. Inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors will ensure that the lived experiences of survivors will be captured in their own words, for publication and archiving for posterity in the National Centre.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government Action Plan also contains important measures which are focused on access to records.  <\/p>  <p>  In setting out this comprehensive suite of commitments, the Government recognises the potential for a future centralised archive of institutional records and personal testimony to support further analysis and research on these important matters.   <\/p>  <p>  As a consequence of all of this ongoing work, the Government will need to give further consideration to the specific recommendation on the Truth Commission. In the coming months, my priority will be to implement the Action Plan and deliver the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, which will provide full, unredacted access to birth and early life information for people affected by illegal birth registration, adopted people, and anyone with questions as to their origins. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service","counter":1338,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1339,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[24385\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX06400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of young persons who are currently on remand at Oberstown Children Detention Campus for more than four months as of 6 May 2022.","asker":"1476","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1340,"content":"<p>There are two young people on remand over four months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700078#WRX06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":1342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1343,"qnumday":549,"qnumall":"[24430\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if the Royal City of Dublin Hospital on Baggot Street, Dublin 4 could be upgraded to accommodate Ukrainian refugees.","asker":"1555","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1344,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine on February 24, and the invoking of the Temporary Protection Directive shortly thereafter, my Department has been working intensively as part of the cross-Government response to the Ukraine crisis.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is focused on providing short term accommodation to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.

My Department tasked Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services to manage the programme, with Pobal being responsible for governance and financial accountability.  <\/p>  <p>  Between 2013 and 2018, ABC organisations operated on three-year contracts with multi-annual budgets. During this time, Pobal gave approval for individual ABC organisations to carry over a certain amount of unspent funds, resulting in an increased yearly spend. In 2018, the ABC Programme transitioned to Tusla and since October of that year, it has operated as part of the wider Tusla PPFS programme.<\/p>  <p>  Since transitioning to Tusla, the practice of the retention of unspent funds has been changed in line with public financial guidance. However, this long standing practice amongst some ABCs has resulted in a shortfall between annual spending and funding received from Tusla. This is due to timing issues and established practices that had existed in ABCs prior to the transition.   <\/p>  <p>  To address this shortfall, Tusla adjusted its PPFS budgets in 2021 to avoid the need for a reduction in funding. As a result, the 4% budget increase for community organisations in 2022, will not be extended to ABCs directly. Instead, this funding will go towards the overall ABC Programme budget to ensure the future viability of the programme going forward.<\/p>  <p>  As an independent state agency, Tusla is responsible for the management and oversight of exchequer funding allocated to it, including funding provided to the ABC Programme.

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.  Recommendations 1-6 in the Expert Group report set out how Core Funding should be designed and implemented. <\/p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.<\/p><p>Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.<\/p><p>The total budget for Core Funding is made up of four elements: an allocation for staff costs, including staff costs related to both contact and non-contact time and employer costs (&euro;138 million); allocation for graduate premiums for graduate Lead Educators and Managers (&euro;38 million); allocation for administration time (&euro;25 million); and allocation for non staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million).<\/p><p>This budget will be distributed to services based on two factors - the service's capacity (number of places, age group of children and hours places are available) and the extent of graduate leadership in the service.  The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that PRSI, holiday, sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding.<\/p><p>Non-contact time is therefore factored into the allocation in two ways. Firstly, data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile on current amount of contact and non-contact time for different grades of staff was used to build in an allowance for non-contact time into the allocation for staff costs. Secondly, there is a separate allocation for administrative staff\/time of &euro;25 million.<\/p><p>In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to supporting graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme. <\/p><p>Core Funding is allocated to services based on the hours that the service is open and available to children. Core Funding is therefore related to the costs of delivery as this has been determined to be a fair and reasonable way to allocate the funding. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than services opening fewer hours or offering fewer places. This is because their costs of operation are higher. <\/p><p>Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly.  The benefit is due to the combined effect of the base rate allocation for sessional pre-school services, the allocation of graduate premiums for Lead Educators and Managers, and the fact that allocations will be made based on capacity, rather than occupancy and most ECCE services do not operate at full occupancy. No service will lose out. I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same.  It is estimated that the funding guarantee will be required for just 1% services.<\/p><p>A Ready Reckoner has been launched to assist providers to understand the impact of Core Funding for their particular service.  City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at <i>myccc.ie\/where-is-my-nearest-ccc<\/i>.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers. This sees public funding for the employment of graduates in ELC will be more fairly distributed across the system.<\/p><p>In December 2021, I also launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. <\/p><p>In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including many of those highlighted in the question , such as the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, detailed information relating to Core Funding is now available at <i>first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/core-funding<\/i>.<\/p><p>The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.<\/p><p>I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1361,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[24586\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"his plans to fund early childhood care and education scheme operators to finance a graduate uplift payment for childcare staff who have skilled up; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1362,"content":"<p><i>'<\/i>First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families' recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality ELC.

Key to this new funding model is Core Funding, to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.<\/p><p>In Budget 2022, I announced the introduction from September 2022 of this new Core Funding stream for services. The total available Budget for Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;221 million in a full programme year, contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee. <\/p><p>The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality ELC and SAC costs more than the current income to the sector. The aim of Core Funding is to allow providers&rsquo; costs to increase to improve quality but to ensure these costs are not passed onto parents in fees and that services are not made unsustainable. Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity.<\/p><p>Additionally, a further &euro;38 million will be distributed to services with ELC graduate Lead Educators\/Managers through the ELC Graduate Premium. In order for a service to be allocated an ELC Graduate Premium, the person in question must be a Lead Educator in an ELC room and\/or the Centre Manager of an ELC or a combined ELC and SAC service and must hold an appropriate qualification as per the Department&rsquo;s Higher Capitation Qualifications list. They must also have a minimum of three years&rsquo; experience in the sector. The ELC Graduate Premium is calculated based on the number of hours of provision led by ELC graduate; and if the ELC or combined ELC and SAC service has an ELC graduate as the Manager.<\/p><p>Changing the approach to funding ELC Graduates will:<\/p><p>1. Extend support for the employment of Graduate Lead Educators outside of the ECCE programme to ensure that children in other parts of ELC have the opportunity to benefit from graduate-led provision.  <\/p><p>2. Introduce a Graduate Premium to be paid in respect of Managers of ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. This is because of the strong evidence of the importance of graduate leadership in shaping quality for children.<\/p><p>3. Bring the financial support for Graduate Lead Educators more closely in alignment with the costs of delivery for that type of provision.<\/p><p>Core Funding will enable providers to better attract and retain staff, including degree-qualified staff; establish career structures; and introduce or improve other factors that contribute to high-quality early learning and childcare, such as non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation.<\/p><p>In December last year, I launched 'Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028'. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in ELC and SAC. <\/p><p>In particular, Nurturing Skills commits to the provision of funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for current early years educators. This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding scheme will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to ELC services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed.<\/p><p>This planned new funding for educators to upskill is in addition to financial supports that are already in place for educators undertaking qualifications. Existing financial supports include the Free Fees Initiative.

Both have distinct functions, powers and methods of working. Tusla has a statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. In doing so, it relies heavily on individuals reporting concerns about children, in accordance with Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017 and the Children First Act 2015.<\/p><p>The Children First Act 2015, which was fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for mandated reporting of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children. The Act places an obligation on providers of relevant services to keep children safe from harm, to carry out a risk assessment and to develop a Child Safeguarding Statement (CSS) that outlines the policies and procedures that are in place to manage any risks identified.<i><\/i>A hospital, hospice, health care centre or other centre which receives, treats or otherwise provides physical or mental health services to children is a provider of relevant services for the purposes of the Children First Act.  <\/p><p>The Act provides for mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by certain key professionals, including teachers and health care professionals. Under the Act mandated persons are required to report child protection concerns at or above a defined threshold to Tusla.

The list of mandated persons, is set out in Schedule 2 of the Act.<\/p><p>The Act operates side-by-side with the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017. The guidance sets out how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla and what organisations need to do to keep children safe. These guidelines have been in place since 1999 and were fully revised and published in October 2017 to include reference to provisions of the Act.<\/p><p>Apart from the Children First Act 2015, a number of policy and legislative improvements have been made to child protection standards in recent years which includes the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 - 2016. The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 which falls under the remit of the Minister for Justice, requires that any person who has information about a serious offence against a child, which may result in charges or prosecution, must report this to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

There are three strands to the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) with an overall funding envelope of &euro;42m between the periods 2017 to 2022.Strand 2 provides bursaries to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan. With effect from the 2021\/22 academic year, a three-tier system of bursary provision has been introduced. This consists of the existing 203 bursaries arising from the original call worth &euro;5,000 per annum (Tier 1), 120 bursaries worth &euro;2,000 per annum (Tier 2) and a number of once-off bursaries worth &euro;1,500 payable for the 2021\/22 academic year only (Tier 3).<\/p><p>Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.<\/p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding , Supply Chain Associate. <\/p><p>A Bar Manager Apprenticeship was launched at the beginning of March 2022 along with a Wind Turbine Maintenance apprenticeship. Most recently, an apprenticeship in Transport Operations &amp;amp; Commercial Driving has been launched. Programme development has been approved for progression for a further range of 14 programmes in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, and a number of others are at the early initial proposal stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":1403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1404,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[24399\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of capital public expenditure at Dublin City University in the past five years; and the individual projects supported.","asker":"1476","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1405,"content":"<p>Please find attached details of capital (infrastructure) funding provided by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and previously the Department of Education and Skills, to Dublin City University from 2018 to the present date, as requested. <table>    <tr>       <th>Dublin City University<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>       <th>2021<\/th>       <th>2022<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Devolved Grant<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2,367,000.00<\/td>       <td>2,271,826.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>St. Patricks F-Block Building<\/td>       <td>3,000,000.00<\/td>       <td>8,845,238.51<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Future Technology Building<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>804,481.00<\/td>       <td>1,153,581.99<\/td>       <td>881,636.89<\/td>       <td>214,725.60<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ICT Grant<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>641,843.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Marconi Building BER Upgrade &amp;amp; Retrofit Project<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>114,466.23<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>3,000,000.00<\/td>       <td>9,649,719.51<\/td>       <td>4,162,424.99<\/td>       <td>3,267,929.12<\/td>       <td>214,725.60<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700079#WRY06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":1407,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700080#WRZ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[24423\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700080#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the percentage of the total full-time undergraduate student body in receipt of SUSI support since 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1409,"content":"<p>The Student Grant Scheme is the principal support for students in financial terms by my Department.

If the minor was born in the State after 1 January 2005, and was not entitled to Irish citizenship at the time of birth, but has since accumulated five years&rsquo; reckonable residence they should use Form 11. <\/p><p>Section 6A of the 1956 Act also provides details on the criteria for naturalisation that applies to a child born to parents who were legally resident in the State at the time of their birth.<\/p><p>It is my intention that the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will reduce the residency requirements for naturalisation for children born in the State from 5 years to 3 years and will also set out clear procedures that will apply to citizenship applications relating to children.<\/p><p>Detailed information on Irish citizenship and the naturalisation process, along with the relevant application forms and guidance notes, is available on my Department's immigration website at: www.irishimmigration.ie\/how-to-become-a-citizen\/.<\/p><p>There are currently 3,012 applications in the system in respect of a minor who is the child of a naturalised Irish citizen. Details of the processing time by this application category only are not maintained by my Department.<\/p><p>As a result of the introduction of the temporary statutory declaration process in January 2021, and the additional staff assigned to the citizenship team, last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were delivered, which is the highest number of decisions since 2015 and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.<\/p><p>Since 1 January 2022, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This is also freeing up valuable staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will also help to reduce processing times. <\/p><p>A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.<\/p><p>The following table provides a breakdown decisions of per year for minors.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Decisions <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>1,870 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>1,375 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>1,318 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>778 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>820 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>665 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700080#WRZ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1455,"content":"<p>Question No. 586 answered with Question No. 585.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1456,"content":"<p>Question No. 587 answered with Question No. 585.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1457,"content":"<p>Question No. 588 answered with Question No. 585.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1458,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700080#WRZ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1459,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[24213\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700080#WRZ05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number and corresponding percentage of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have a moderate and-or strong competency in spoken Irish by Gaeltacht area in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Department and the bodies and agencies under its aegis are committed to ensuring that obligations for reasonable accommodation under the Employment Equality Acts, 1998-2015 are met, and that all staff have access to equal opportunities surrounding employment, career progression, learning and development and all other aspects of working life.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that on 11 March 2022, my Department launched its first Equality Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, which provides clear milestones and a framework through which it will build on its ambition to be an organisation that is welcoming and inclusive. This Strategy strengthens the Department&rsquo;s capabilities to promote equality, embrace diversity and foster inclusion in its day to day business and services, in policy-making and in providing equal opportunities for all staff.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer, who is available to provide confidential support, information and advice to all staff with disabilities and their managers. The Disability Liaison Officer actively engages with staff with a disability to ensure reasonable accommodations are put in place to enable them to carry out their roles effectively, access training and development, and pursue opportunities for career progression and promotion.<\/p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodation measures include, but are not limited to, assistive software or hardware, accessible parking, role adjustment\/tailoring, or time off to attend medical appointments related to a disability.

In this regard, there has been significant implementation of many of the relevant recommendations, sometimes to a greater extent than that envisaged by the Review, in the intervening period. Such improvements were effected through amendments to the Coroners Act 1962 in 2005, 2011, 2013, 2019 and 2020 as follows:<\/p>  <p>-  The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005 ended the restriction on the number of medical witnesses allowed at inquest.<\/p>  <p>-  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provided for the restructuring and amalgamation of coronial districts. Coroner districts within counties have been amalgamated as the opportunities have arisen. There were 48 districts in 2000, this has reduced to 38 in 2022.<\/p>  <p>-  The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provided for legal aid and legal advice by certification by the coroner to the Legal Aid Board in relation to inquests.<\/p>  <p>-  The Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 clarified, strengthened and modernised coroner&rsquo;s powers in the reporting, investigation and inquest of deaths. The scope of enquires at inquest was expanded beyond being limited to establishing the medical cause of death, to seeking to establish, to the extent the coroner considers necessary, the circumstances in which the death occurred. The Act also broadened the coroner&rsquo;s powers relating to mandatory reporting and inquest of maternal deaths, deaths in custody or childcare situations and significant new powers to compel witnesses and evidence at inquest.<\/p>  <p>-  The Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 provided, among other items, for the assignment and appointment of temporary coroners to act simultaneously with other coroners in exceptional circumstances to be utilised as part of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to reform of the Coroners Service, the Coroners Bill 2007, incorporated many of the more than 100 recommendations contained in the 2000 Review.

However, I'm pleased to say that, subject to public health guidelines, my Department intends to host in-person citizenship ceremonies in June and December of this year in Killarney.<\/p><p>The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. <\/p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team. <\/p><p>Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full certified colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.<\/p><p>The average processing time will vary depending on the number of applications being received and the individual complexities of each case. The average processing time in 2022 is 19 months and it is hoped that with the continued introduction of enhanced digital processing measures and the ongoing improvements to service delivery that the trend in the average processing time should fall. <\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following three tables. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Number of

All permissions are extended on the same terms and conditions to the permission already held.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to the person concerned to contact their local Immigration Office before 31 May 2022 to apply for a further renewal of their immigration permission. I strongly recommend that they make any efforts to renew their permission as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  A Stamp 4 permission provides that the holder can reside and work in Ireland for a specified period, subject to conditions. Any period spent on a Stamp 4 permission is considered as reckonable residence when applying for citizenship by way of naturalisation.<\/p>  <p>  The person does not need to be granted naturalisation in order to work in the State while they hold a stamp 4 immigration permission. The conditions attaching to any employment such as relevant qualifications or professional accreditation or membership is a matter for the employer and the employee and is not a condition of a Stamp 4 permission. <\/p>  <p>  As the person referred to is also a Ukrainian national, if they chose not to renew their current permission at their local immigration office and their permission expires, they may be eligible to seek Temporary Protection in accordance with the EU Directive. They should visit a Ukraine Support Centre (in Cork Street in Dublin or in Limerick City) to apply for a Temporary Protection permission letter. More information is available at www.gov.ie\/ukraine. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed in line with the eligibility criteria as set out under the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.

This is subject to the complaint meeting admissibility requirements with regard to time limits which may be extended for good reason and other criteria. Where a criminal offence is identified GSOC may send a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions recommending the prosecution of the former member concerned. There are, however, challenges in dealing with allegations of a non-criminal nature as former members are not amenable to Garda disciplinary action. As a result, any recommendations that GSOC might make on foot of its investigation, for action by the Garda Commissioner in respect of the former member, cannot be acted upon. <\/p>  <p>  The Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill will provide for a reformed and strengthened GSOC in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.

The Garda investigation remains open and any new evidence provided to the Garda authorities will be investigated.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to seek the full truth of these attacks. An all-party motion that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, calls on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The Programme for Government reiterates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to engaging with the British Government on this issue as a matter of priority, in accordance with the All-Party D&aacute;il motions.

While the bombings do not come under the Kenova criminal investigations, they are being examined as one of the incidents in Operation Denton. <\/p>  <p>  Operation Denton is a distinct strand in the work of Kenova, an analytical review rather than a criminal investigation and, as a result, it was necessary to request legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General in order to progress how cooperation can take place with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term residential care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p><p>One of the key principles of the scheme is that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of their care, and a participant will only pay for the amount of time they actually spend in care.<\/p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension, and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap, which is intended to protect the value of a principal private residence, along with the other safeguards built into the Financial Assessment which ensure that:<\/p><p>-Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<\/p><p>- A participant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater, and;<\/p><p>- If a participant has a spouse or partner remaining at home, they will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater<\/p><p>Please note that an asset will be exempt from financial assessment only if it has been transferred more than five years prior to the date the person enters long term care.<\/p><p>NHSS participants who own property\/land-based assets in the State also have access to Ancillary State Support, or the Nursing Home Loan, an optional feature of the Fair Deal Scheme. It is a loan advanced by the HSE to help people meet the portion of their contribution to the cost of care that is based on property\/land-based assets, most typically against the personal residence. If an individual secures ancillary state support, they will not need to contribute against the value of the relevant property during their time on the scheme, unless the property is sold during that time.<\/p><p>Ancillary State Support becomes repayable following the occurrence of a relevant event, most commonly after the death of the client. If the loan is repaid in a timely fashion (in the event of the death of the scheme participant, this is 12 months), no interest is applied. In certain conditions - for example, where a partner or child continues to reside in the property - a further deferral to the repayment of the loan can be granted.<\/p><p>Additional information about the application process can be accessed online by following this link: <\/p><p><i>www2.hse.ie\/services\/fair-deal-scheme\/about-the-fair-deal-scheme.html<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":1640,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1641,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[24167\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to make Kaftrio available to children with cystic fibrosis who have only one delta F508 mutation and as such have no other suitable modulator; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[24368\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the situation of 35 children with cystic fibrosis (details supplied) who are being denied access to the life-changing drug kaftrio; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 650 and 683 together.<\/p><p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1645,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[24174\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the difficulties in recruiting occupational therapists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1646,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1647,"content":"<p>Question No. 652 answered with Question No. 636.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1648,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1649,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[24190\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700083#WRCC05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the criteria which are applied to the long-term illness scheme; if Addison&rsquo;s disease will be included in the scheme; if not, the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1512","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1650,"content":"<p>The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended).

These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. <\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.  <\/p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to extend the list of illnesses covered by the scheme.

The main purpose of the Act is to set out the law governing access to termination of pregnancy in Ireland. It permits termination to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman; where there is a condition present which is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth; and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.<\/p><p>Section 11 puts provisions in place for carrying out a termination of pregnancy in which there is a condition present affecting the foetus that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus before or within 28 days of birth.  The process requires the involvement of two medical practitioners, one of whom must be an obstetrician and the other a medical practitioner of a relevant specialty. Both must certify their reasonable opinion, formed in good faith before the procedure can be carried out and, the procedure must then be carried out by the certifying obstetrician, or in cases where the second certifying doctor is also an obstetrician, either one may carry out the procedure.<\/p><p>Notifications received by the Minister for Health under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 are as set out below.<\/p><p>Section 20 of the Act of 2018 provides for a notification system in relation to all terminations of pregnancy carried out under the legislation.

Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Minister for Health has no role in these decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2013 Act, the HSE also has statutory responsibility for the administration of the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and the community drug schemes, including the Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The LTI scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. <\/p>  <p>   Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are currently no plans to extend the list of illnesses covered by the scheme, the LTI scheme will be included in a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. <\/p>  <p>   In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. The HSE's reimbursement list is the same for the DPS as it is for the GMS scheme.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the GMS scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. <\/p>  <p>   In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. <\/p>  <p>   Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700086#WRFF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Bodies","counter":1829,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700086#WRFF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1830,"qnumday":715,"qnumall":"[24666\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051700086#WRFF03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the new role that has been assigned to the WHO in the context of pandemics; and if the role reduces the discretion of Government in framing responses to any future pandemic.","asker":"1549","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1831,"content":"<p>On 1 December 2021, the members of the World Health Organisation reached consensus to begin the process to negotiate a convention, agreement or other international instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.

A broadleaf tree, such as oak, has a lower mean annual sequestration rate of 2.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare. Therefore, depending on the species composition of the forests the sequestration rate will vary over time.
