I cannot believe that I am once again here talking about paying student nurses and midwives.  I ask the Minister of State to take my pleading back to the Minister for Health to sort out the pandemic payment for student nurses and midwives.  It is unbelievable that this is still going on.  A year ago, I introduced a piece of legislation that would allow student nurses and midwives to be paid.  The Government, cynically, did not oppose the Bill.  In fact, it let it proceed to Second Stage and be sent off into the ether rather than face a bad headline of once again simply refusing to acknowledge it or to commit to paying student nurses and midwives.  Whatever about the argument that student nurses and midwives are not working and, accordingly, whether they should therefore be paid, that is a little bit beyond the scope of what I am here to speak about today.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State why student nurses and midwives have still not been paid the promised pandemic payment.  I have spoken to a number of student nurses and midwives around the country, and they want the Government to put its money where its mouth is and instead of clapping for them, to pay them the promised pandemic payment.  Students were deployed to fight this virus and while the Government did pay them the rate during the first wave, they ended up working during the much more aggressive second and third waves free of charge.  Student nurses and midwives took on the same workload as nurses while still balancing learning the skills required as part of their college training placement.<\/p> <p>I will not lie.  After two years of this pandemic, with all that we asked of student nurses and midwives and all that they did on the Covid-19 front line, I was almost apoplectic when I learned that the reason their payment, for which they have been fighting tooth and nail, was not yet paid was because a memorandum had not yet been written.  It is a very hard pill for student nurses and midwives to swallow that they are not getting a payment they had been promised from September, one I was told had been approved by the Cabinet before Christmas, although it is now February, nearly March, because a memorandum has not been written.  That is beyond unseemly.  It is extremely frustrating for student nurses and midwives.<\/p> <p>It is unbelievable that we have left struggling student nurses and midwives, and have not paid them this meagre contribution given that they held the hands of dying patients at the height of the pandemic when their family could not be there for them.  They cared for elderly patients on wards and played a crucial role in keeping the lights on and the doors open while Covid consumed the health service, all while they were students and supposed to be learning and on placement, upskilling and training to get the technical skills that are so desperately needed on their part.  The pandemic payment is not a whopper.  I believe it is &euro;100 a week, which is not insignificant.  It is incredible that it has not yet been paid.<\/p> <p>I would contest that student nurses and midwives are currently working for free, but the Government has the power to change that.  The Minister of State will probably tell me that the reason they have not been paid is because a memorandum has not gone out and that someone else has not done the work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ultimately the Minister for Health is in charge of ensuring that student nurses and midwives are being paid.

It is not the first time she has taken to her feet to raise this.  A key Government priority is to protect the education of all students,  including student nurses and midwives.  Clinical placements account for 50% of the overall education programme requirements for student nurses and midwives and supporting students to undertake clinical placement remains a key priority for the Government.  In early 2021 the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, directed a longer term review of matters relating to student nurses and midwives to be undertaken.  He appointed Mr. Se&aacute;n McHugh to carry out this important work.  In November 2021 following consideration of the recommendations within the McHugh report, Government approved the Minister's interim proposals to provide significant additional supports, worth &euro;12 million, to student nurses and midwives while attending their clinical placements.<\/p> <p>For supernumerary students these proposals extended the pandemic placement grant, PPG, of &euro;100 per week to all eligible nursing and midwifery students on placement for this academic year backdated to September 2021.  In addition, the McHugh report sets out recommendations to enhance the current travel and subsistence scheme for students in attending their supernumerary clinical placements.  The Minister will consider these further so that a permanent enhanced scheme can be developed that will provide a targeted and more equitable approach to supporting students in undertaking supernumerary clinical placements, to be in place from September 2022.<\/p> <p>In the meantime the Minister has doubled the weekly cap on vouched accommodation allowance to &euro;100 per week of placement for supernumerary students needing overnight accommodation away from their normal place of residence in order to attend some of their clinical placements, which is also backdated to September 2021.<\/p> <p>In regard to internship students on rostered placement, work is ongoing to progress other recommendations within the McHugh report, including increasing the salary of intern students to 80% of the staff nurse salary.  In the meantime we are providing student nurses and midwives on paid internship placement with additional support of &euro;50 per week of placement, amounting to &euro;1,800 in total.  This is for the duration of their internship and is with effect from January 2022, the same date as paid internships for the current academic year began.  <\/p> <p>To go to the nub of the Senator's question, on 22 January 2022 the Department issued sanction to the HSE regarding these additional supports and requested that payment be prioritised.  Yesterday the Department was informed by the HSE that it is finalising a memo to be issued to services to provide for payment.  As part of this process the draft communication has been shared with representative groups.  After the memo is finalised and issued, the HSE has confirmed payment will follow the normal lead in time for routine payment cycles which I believe is fortnightly.  The Department has once again emphasised to the HSE the importance of expediting these payments.<\/p> <p>In conclusion the Department has also commenced its work on the recommendations from the McHugh report that are applicable to the next academic year, and in this regard the Minister intends to bring a detailed proposal to Government in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#C00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

It is still somewhat in the hopefully not-too-distant future, which will bring student nurses and midwives some comfort but it will not help them backdate anything.  Backdated payments are all well and good if you can afford to have a backdated payment.  However, landlords are not going to take backdated rent, Vodafone will not take a backdated bill, and Tesco is not going to take a backdated payment for groceries.

I am raising this matter about the adult metabolic services at the Mater hospital in Dublin.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the importance of the work that this unit does.<\/p> <p>However, it is, unfortunately, significantly under-resourced.  There are much-needed resources required for this unit to operate at a reasonable capacity.  At the moment, it is not operating to its capacity at all.  It certainly is not reaching its potential and, sadly, it is not reaching the potential that it could achieve for the patients who are suffering.  I am thinking particularly of the patients who are diagnosed with phenylketonuria, PKU.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of how debilitating PKU can be.<\/p> <p>From birth, many children who are diagnosed with PKU find that their eating habits have to be completely altered.  They are isolated from their peers even when they go away on school tours, trips away and so on.  They have to have a special diet because of their condition.  This continues into adulthood.  A friend of mine has it and it is a daily struggle in terms of just putting together a diet that one would feel satisfied with and one would feel they are fulfilling the best they can in life.  That is a huge strain on people.  It is a huge strain on people&rsquo;s mental and physical health.<\/p> <p>We have, as a society, a responsibility to do all that we can to support these people who are a small minority of our population.  Yet, Ireland has double the European average of people who suffer from PKU.  Many medicines are being trialled but, unfortunately, they are not being trialled on adults because the resources are not there and the expertise is not in place at the Mater to do so.  I am thinking, particularly, of a drug called Kuvan.  Perhaps the Minister of State is aware of this drug.  It is a new drug and it is believed it can revolutionise the lives of people who have PKU.  However, it is no good to people in Ireland who are suffering from PKU because the drug is not being trialled at the Mater hospital.<\/p> <p>Kuvan is just one drug.  I believe there is much research internationally being done on PKU.  There are many drugs at pretrial and trial stage in other countries.  However, we are a long way down the line from ever being able to trial those drugs in this country.  <\/p> <p>PKU sufferers are citizens of this country as well.

The spend on health in this country has increased year-on-year dating back over the past ten years.  The health budget is &euro;24 billion.  When &euro;24 billion is being spent on health, all citizens should have a reasonable expectation that they are going to benefit from it.  This unit in the Mater hospital needs investment.

This centre provides assessment and treatment to adults with inherited metabolic disorders.  It is also responsible for the diagnosis and management of these patients.  Inherited metabolic disorders include a diverse group of rare conditions that can result in significant morbidity and mortality.  Presentation may occur at any age.  With advances in healthcare delivery and new therapeutic interventions an increasing number of affected children whose lifespan previously would have been severely curtailed are now reaching adulthood.<\/p> <p>The adult metabolic service in the Mater hospital provides multidisciplinary care for patients with metabolic disorders.  These disorders include phenylketonuria, PKU, which the Senator has spoken about, galactosemia and lysosomal disease.  This important service helps patients to manage their conditions with optimal diets that match their metabolic needs.  The HSE has informed me that current staffing in this important service at the Mater hospital is 12.5 whole-time equivalents.  This team includes consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, dieticians, a medical social worker, a psychologist and administration staff.  Currently, approximately 900 adult patients attend the metabolic service at the Mater hospital.  It is anticipated that will increase by at least 100 additional patients per annum over the next five years.  These additional patients will include transition patients from the paediatric services located in Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Temple Street.  In addition to the above, the centre tests patients' responses to therapies for PKU treatment.<\/p> <p>Since August 2019, newborns diagnosed with PKU have been tested in CHI at Temple Street and treated, when responsive, with Kuvan.  There are also a number of patients with known dietary requirements who have been trialled on this medication.  Once a child is placed on Kuvan, this treatment is expected to be lifelong.  To date, access to Kuvan has not been available for PKU adults attending the centre at the Mater hospital, other than for three patients who received ongoing approval following an earlier phase 3 clinical trial extension. <\/p> <p>I have some good news for the Senator.  I have been informed that the HSE and the Mater hospital have now agreed appropriate funding levels for 15.6 whole-time equivalent staff and the Mater hospital is commencing this recruitment process.  With this resource in place, the centre at the Mater hospital will begin to expand the service to meet current and future requirements.  This resource will also support provision of Kuvan trialling and monitoring for appropriate patients with PKU.  I am assured that the HSE and the Ireland East Hospital Group remain committed to the progressive development of metabolic services at the Mater hospital and to improving this service for patients of the Ireland east region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#E00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive update.

In 2021, a specialist menopause clinic was established under the governance of the National Maternity Hospital, the first publicly funded clinic of its kind.  Budget 2022 provided the necessary funding to enable the roll-out of an additional three specialist menopause clinics.  As to the Senator's question on whether they will all be Dublin based, she will be delighted to learn that they will not be.  There will be one in Galway, one in Cork and one in Limerick.  The three new menopause clinics being established in 2022 will be part of the maternity networks in the South\/South West, University Limerick and Saolta hospital groups.  This provides a good catchment area around the country.  As I understand it, the operationalisation of the new clinics will be dependent on resourcing the necessary staff.  In this regard, the HSE's national women and infants health programme has advised that the engagement with the relevant hospital groups is progressing as planned.<\/p> <p>Across each of the issues raised under this Commencement matter - period poverty, contraception and menopause - we are committed to progressing the agenda and advancing women's health experiences and outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#G00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that positive response.

The programme for Government and climate action plan set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector from 7 megatons of carbon dioxide in 2018 to between 3.5 megatons and 4.5 megatons in 2030.  A comprehensive retrofit programme will be a key measure to support the achievement of this target.<\/p> <p>We will need to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 and undertake the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by the end of 2030.  This represents approximately 30% of the housing stock and is among the most ambitious retrofitting programmes in the world.<\/p> <p>The national retrofit plan was published last November as part of the climate action plan 2021 and sets out how the Government will deliver these targets.  The plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key pillars.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->First is driving demand and activity, second is financing and funding, third is supply chain skills and standards and fourth is governance.<\/p><p>Recognising that the achievement of our climate action plan targets will require a step change in the pace and scale of delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s residential retrofit programme, the Government has approved a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades to create warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills.  The key measures include: first, a new national home energy upgrade scheme, providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 building energy rating, BER, standard.  That is up from 30% to 35% of grants that were available.  There are a significantly increased number of free energy upgrades for those who are at risk of energy poverty.  That is up to &euro;400 per month, from an average of &euro;177 per month in 2021.  There is a special enhanced grant rate, which is equivalent to 80% of the typical cost for attic and cavity wall insulation for all households.  That is to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government's response to current exceptionally high energy prices.<\/p><p>The new initiatives will be funded by the unprecedented national development plan financial allocation for residential retrofit.  That is &euro;8 billion available up to 2030.  More than 60% of this funding, &euro;5 billion, will be sourced from carbon tax revenue.  A total of &euro;267 million has been allocated for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's residential and community schemes and the solar photovoltaic scheme in 2022.  This is the highest ever allocation for the schemes.  The investment this year would support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes, to a building energy rating of B2.  This is a near doubling of the number of homes delivered to B2 in 2021.  In addition, &euro;85 million funding has been provided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, for the local authority energy efficiency retrofit programme.  This means that of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million, 58%, or &euro;203 million, will be spent on dedicated energy poverty schemes and local authority retrofits.<\/p><p>Regarding wood pellet burners, a marginal abatement cost curve was developed as part of the climate action plan.  That was to provide a solid, analytical foundation on the most cost-effective pathway to reduce emissions in line with Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation targets.  In using Ireland&rsquo;s 2018 greenhouse gas emissions projections to 2035, associated projections of economic activity and assessments across 300 business cases for technology, the analysis identifies the technologies, including fuel switches and the associated levels of adoption that are required to meet our 2030 targets in the most economical way.  Our national target of 400,000 heat pumps was derived from this analysis, and Government funding and incentives are aligned with this policy objective, as opposed to other heating systems, such as wood pellet burners, which do not have national targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#H00800","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It will be ready within a small number of months.<\/p> <p>Regarding the deep retrofits, our analysis says that approximately 50% of homes need their attic insulation redone and  that they would get a great return on investment by doing that.  Attic and cavity wall insulation are the two most cost-effective measures.  For somebody who spends &euro;500 on getting their cavity walls and their attic insulated, the Government will pay &euro;2,500 on top of that &euro;500.  That means that they will make back about &euro;300 a year.  It means that their return on investment of &euro;500 down will be made within less than two years.  It is a very good way to save money on electricity bills.  It is worth more per year than the &euro;200 that we are putting in people's accounts on one-off basis.

It is simply wrong that while members of the Defence Forces are currently beneficiaries of the public sector pay determination process, they are, in fact, precluded from participating in any meaningful way because their representative bodies are not permitted to affiliate with ICTU.  It is vital they are offered the support of ICTU prior to the commencement of any pay review and this should happen within the next four weeks.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I met Caoimhe O'Connor from Newbridge, who is graduating from the special needs assistant, SNA, course in University College Dublin on Thursday.

Despite a long-term occupation on the island, it did not stop peace.  It did not stop the silencing of the guns.  Have we something to offer our fellow European neighbours here as we face the worst outbreak potentially of bloodshed and war since the Second World War?  Could we nudge some great peacemakers, like them or not, such as former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, Gerry Adams, Lord David Trimble, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ms Monica McWilliams, and Liz O'Donnell?  If they were asked, they would bring our credibility and experiences.  It is a precious peace, albeit not a perfect peace, on the island of Ireland but maybe we can bring something to at least trigger bilateral talks, which, according to what I am reading, do not seem to even be happening at present.  There is no sign of bilateral talks.  I note both parties might be reluctant to enter bilateral talks but as a catalyst, even if it is behind the scenes, Ireland, as a credible country, has something to offer on its own peace journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#Q00200","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Ardmh&eacute;ara Chorcaigh agus a mhac at&aacute; linn inniu fosta.

We travelled on a number of international delegations to the United States, in his role as chair of the development committee and my role as ardmh&eacute;ara in Belfast.  I knew Christopher before that, perhaps not in the same personal sense but certainly in a political sense, as he would often turn up at events wearing Union Jack socks and a pinstripe suit.  One thing you could never take away from Christopher was his commitment to his unionist and, he would say, conservative views and the very articulate and passionate way that he advocated them.  He and I had many disagreements on political issues relating to Ireland but also more broadly.  I have to say, however, that I always found him a great character and a great wit.  After a robust debate, I could join him for a cup of coffee or, dare I say it, even the odd pint, to have a really respectful conversation.<\/p><p>One thing that struck me in later years with Christopher was the real love and commitment he had for his wife Laura and their four children.  They are first and foremost in all of our thoughts.  Christopher's death is a big loss to them, his broader family, his DUP family and his constituents in south Belfast.  On my behalf and on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group and, I am sure, colleagues across the House, I extend deepest sympathies to Laura and Christopher's children.<\/p><p>I might return to this matter given the limited time I have available to me but the Leader will have seen coverage of our neighbour, the National Gallery, whose staff and a number of artists have taken issue with the award of a particular contract.  I sense your eyes on me, a Chathaoirligh, so I will not go into the specifics around contractual and procurement issues.  Nevertheless, the best artists are those who hold a mirror up to society and challenge some of its worst elements.  Direct provision remains a real issue and a problem and concern for many people across society.  I hope to return to the issue, but in light of what has been said in the public domain in recent weeks about the National Gallery, it is timely for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, to come to the House to discuss the programme for Government commitment to end direct provision and to give an update on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#Q00300","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I very much welcome Lord Mayor Kelleher and his son to the Chamber.  I also extend deepest sympathies, on behalf of the Labour Party Senators, to the Stalford family on the loss of Christopher.  It is a shocking time for the DUP and the wider unionist family but there was shock right across the island of Ireland in recent days when people learned of his passing.<\/p> <p>The Continent of Europe has entered a very dark period with the events in Ukraine in recent days.  I express my solidarity with all the people of Ukraine.  While the news of the package of sanctions is very welcome and the detail is eagerly awaited, we need to hear a very strong message from the Government about supporting the sanctions.  Ireland is a net exporter to Russia, but we rely hugely on fossil fuel imports from Russia.  We must be seen to be very strong in backing the sanctions against Russia at this point following its acts of aggression against its neighbour, Ukraine.<\/p> <p>The main issue I wish to raise today relates to the announcement yesterday of the postponement of the citizens' assembly on drug use until 2023.  This flies directly in the face of the Taoiseach's commitment on the floor of the D&aacute;il just two weeks ago.  It runs contrary also to what he said in the Fergus McCabe lecture last year.

As my colleague, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who spent many years campaigning on these issues, said, lives are going to be lost.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of lives lost to drug overdoses when compared to every other EU member state.  In 2017 alone <b>377<\/b>people lost their lives due to a drug overdose.  Many were concentrated in some of the most deprived and disadvantaged parts of this country.  It is, however, important to say this is an issue affecting all of Ireland.  It is not just confined to Dublin, Cork or Limerick or the main urban centres.<br\/><br\/>There is much anger and frustration at the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  We had tried to work constructively with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on the drugs issue since he took up his position but we now need to hear from people more senior than him, namely, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, what they are going to do about drugs policy in this country.  If there is going to be a citizens' assembly on drugs in 2023 - we are told it is going to happen then but it may not - it will be 2024 before the Government can even begin to consider the recommendations.  Are we really going to have a Government make sensitive and difficult decisions a year or months out from a general election?  There is a very serious question mark over all that but the key issue is that we need to hear from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health what their plans are with regard to drugs policy in this country because lives depend on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#R00200","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>We support the call for the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to come into the House to have a debate about where we are on ending direct provision.

We are forgetting about people who have COPD.  I have COPD and I am anxious about people sitting beside me not wearing a mask.  I was on the bus yesterday coming from Donegal and I put my bags beside me because I was not comfortable.

I believe that every Russian oligarch and their family should be stripped of any EU visa in order to send the message very clearly home to Vladimir Putin.  Certainly, there have been calls that UEFA should withdraw the Champions League final from St. Petersburg.  We should in no way allow the Russians to host such an event.  <\/p><p>A message needs to go out very strongly from these Houses, that we stand very much in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  Also, I believe that there are a number of political parties and representatives from this island who have been ambivalent in their attitudes towards Russian aggression and we need to call those out.  It has to be very clear that we will no longer tolerate this.  We have seen two of our MEPs, Mick Wallace, MEP, and Clare Daly, MEP, who, quite frankly, are nothing more than Putin&rsquo;s sock puppets parroting the line of the Kremlin.  Those political representatives who have supported Russia over this time need to be called out.

Some &euro;100 million has been put into making that happen in communities.  We are addressing the barriers along the way.  This is change in motion.  One of the things the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys rightly pointed out yesterday was the need for this to be affordable for people.  She is looking at ways to do that.  Anchor tenancies are a way to do that as well, in terms of bringing in an employee to work on a long-term basis and multiple employees and employers setting up those arrangements.<\/p> <p>It is not just the Department that can help, it is also Revenue.

Not being satisfied with merely dispersing protestors, the state froze the finances associated with certain individuals and companies believed to be involved in the protests.  These are people who committed no crime and have not been convicted lawfully in court but who the Government decided to punish because they might have been connected with a protest that was inconvenient to the government.

First, the EU wants to increase the number of cross-border energy connections.  Second, it wants to accelerate the approval process for renewable energy projects like wind farms.  This will be beneficial to Ireland.  The European legislative process has just started and Ireland should use it to look for further funding from the EU to supercharge our wind farm efforts, including offshore.  There is a funding pot for this.  It is called the Trans-European Network for Energy, TEN-E.  Under it, approximately &euro;5 billion can be availed of by EU member states.  It recently updated its criteria.  One criterion is offshore wind.  Recently, the EU placed Ireland in the North Sea offshore grid, NSOG, priority corridor.  Given that the EU is looking at Ireland as a potential wind champion and other member states like Germany and France do not have the same capacity to produce offshore wind energy as we do, this is a good opportunity for Ireland to apply for funding from the EU to supercharge our wind farm plans and concepts.  This might not only allow us to hit our own wind energy targets by 2030, but also to sell excess wind energy to member states that need it.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been good in coming to this House multiple times to discuss the range of climate action initiatives that are being worked on.

Today's visit was good and appreciated, and I wish to put on the record how proud we in the town of Athy are to have such a group among us.  I congratulate it on the great work it is doing in our community.<\/p><p>I wish to raise the issue of the lack of GPs.  This is a particular problem in the commuting counties.  I am sure the Leader will have encountered it as well.  I have had representations from Louth, Laois, Carlow, Wicklow and my own county of Kildare.  We have provided housing in certain places and people have come to live and join the communities there, but they cannot find GPs.  It is a major problem in south Kildare in particular.  I have written to the Minister and the HSE.  In its latest reply to me, the HSE stated that it had no role or authority in assigning a GP to a private patient.  Where do we go from here?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These people have young children and are raising young families, and they are driving to Dublin to where their previous GP practices were to avail of services for their sick children.

It is just not acceptable.<\/p><p>As I have asked before, we need to have an urgent conversation in that regard and bring the Minister for Health into the Chamber.  With the retirements, etc., of GPs into the future, it is a huge problem for commuting counties and for rural Ireland.  We need a debate on it urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#W00400","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Yesterday, Offaly County Council was pushed to provide safe houses for victims of domestic violence.  It was asked to do so out of its housing allocation as a matter of urgency but the council's response was that it needed more time.  I understand anyone's plea for more time but when we face a crisis, time is often something of which we have little.<\/p> <p>Recently, I met with Offaly Domestic Violence Support Services and it is obvious that victims do not have any more time.  They cannot wait; this cannot wait.  People in these areas need help now and I urge Offaly County Council to act now.<\/p> <p>Last week, Tusla published its review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It highlighted major gaps in services across the country but particularly in the midlands.  Some 62% of people living in County Offaly, 37% of those living in County Laois and a truly shocking 93% of those living in County Longford live more than a 30-minute drive from emergency accommodation.  We need to fix this.  Lack of services for victims is not only a moral failing; it is a failing of our international obligations and we need an immediate solution.<\/p> <p>Following the publication of the Tusla review, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, listed counties Laois, Westmeath and Longford for prioritisation for the urgent provision of family units.  Laois Domestic Abuse Service has been campaigning for many years for a refuge and Portlaoise has been prioritised for eight family places.  Laois County Council is collaborating to identify a suitable site, hopefully as soon as possible.  We need to see the same level of prioritisation for County Offaly.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy McEntee, will outline timelines and structures for the delivery of safe accommodation and refuge places as part of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I understand this strategy will be published in April and I look forward to reviewing it with a midlands lens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#X00200","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I will follow up on my colleague, Senator Flynn's points in terms of public transport.  Research from the UK has found that bus drivers have higher levels of Covid-19 deaths than other occupations.  We also have research that found that 41% of people polled said they were less likely to use public transport after the pandemic.<\/p><p>I am really concerned that removal of masks as a requirement on public transport will, in fact, damage the safety of those working and those who have to travel by public transport and, indeed, as we have seen, discourage others from using public transport when that needs to be a priority in terms of our wider safety and in respect of climate.  I really urge the Government to rethink its policy public transport.<\/p><p>What I will speak about today, however, is something even wider and more important in terms of the pandemic.  It is premature to talk about it being over because we know people are dying all around the world.  Last week, the 6th European Union-African Union Summit: A Joint Vision for 2030 took place.  As we anticipated, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver was a huge issue of trust and damaged trust.  The South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, tweeted that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAn agreement on the #TRIPSWaiver would strengthen and consolidate our relations with Europe.  If we are not able to reach a solution, this will mean we were not able to find each other on a matter of life and death. <\/blockquote> <p>This House passed a motion before Christmas on the TRIPS waiver.  We sent a very strong signal that we recognised the urgency of a TRIPS waiver on life and death.  We wrote to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which responded by saying it did have lead responsibility and that the proposal is primarily one of health policy rather than a general trade or intellectual property issue.<\/p><p>Yet the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, was at that EU summit and he did not speak about it as a life or death issue or as a health issue.  He said at this EU-African summit that we want to avoid the pandemic being used to &quot;undermine innovation or undermine intellectual property.&quot;  I am really concerned that the T&aacute;naiste on one hand tells us it is a health issue, and he acknowledges that, and then speaks on all our behalf in a way that is out of spirit with the statement from this House and with what the Minister for Health said.  He is representing us at a key forum of Europe's conversation with African nations and telling them that he regards intellectual property as a bigger priority than health or life and death.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Again, I hope we can move forward on this.

There are talks of HIQA carrying out an independent investigation.  Yet, University Hospital Limerick is topping the charts in terms of trolley numbers.  It has been doing so consistently for a long time and certainly, something has to happen.  I acknowledge the Minister met staff and senior management but I believe we need to have a fresh pair of eyes looking at University Hospital Limerick to alleviate the plight of both the staff who are working there and of the patients.  It is about safety as well and that patients feel safe when they visit University Hospital Limerick.  Trolley numbers are definitely very high and have been consistently so for a while.

I am surprised by what she said and that is why I texted her.  I was under the impression that the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il a number of weeks ago had agreed to an independent review and now the Senator has been told the Minister on a visit to the hospital this week has said they are only considering it.  That is not good enough.  I will certainly make known the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Leader of the Green Party today.  We have a commitment to make sure we improve those services.  Hundreds of thousands of euro have been given to University Hospital Limerick in recent years but there has been no comparable improvement in services for the people of that region.

It is lovely to see them with their squeaky clean little faces and lovely hairdos and great to see them here.  The Senator raised a really important issue.  I heard the Minister, Deputy Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, interviewed on radio this morning on my drive to the Houses.  He is one of the most thoughtful Ministers we have had in a long time.  I am not being disrespectful to anybody in saying we all have to be a Minister on our first day in office without having been one prior to that.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has taken this issue to heart and has put Trojan effort into making sure this Bill takes into account all of the issues that have been raised with him during the past 18 months.  I have no doubt when it is published this week some people will say it is missing this or that, but he had done an enormous body of work to bring forward the institutional burials Bill.  I reassure the Senator that I spoke to the Minister&rsquo;s private secretary yesterday and there is no doubt we will have this Bill passed by both Houses hopefully by the end of May or the beginning of June.  That should be a priority for all of us.  There are 796 little bodies buried that need to find a connection with their family members.

I had the privilege of meeting Julia and Lenka.  Deputy Joan Collins brought them to me a number of years ago.  They are two remarkable women, but they were incredibly vulnerable when I met them because of how badly they were being treated by their employer, the Ivy, the salubrious restaurant down the road.  They were treated despicably by that organisation, and it gave me great pleasure to see the judgment that was handed down.  The only thing that gave me a little bit of sadness was that they did not get four times the amount of money that was awarded to them.  They had been treated despicably.  We should name and shame every organisation that mistreats the people who go in and provide a service on its behalf on a daily basis and who give the best impression of that organisation.  In the back rooms of such companies' premises, these staff are treated so poorly.<\/p><p>I have been in contact with the two ladies since.  I want to let them know they are the reason we have the new legislation on tips.  They are the reason we started that ball rolling a couple of weeks ago and we had the T&aacute;naiste here a couple of weeks ago.  They are the reason that will make me fight to make sure the service charge is included in the legislation and I have done a bit of research in recent weeks which I did not do when I was in the Department.  The original agreement between the unions and the industry at the time, 48 years ago when service charges were introduced, there was no legislation covering it because it was an agreement between unions and the industry that the service charge would be introduced to make sure the people who were giving you the service got looked after and got paid well.  That was because the wages were always considered too low to earn a living.  There is no reason why any employer should take that to pay for knives, forks, their own bottom line, broken plates or whatever they are having themselves.  It is for the people who serve us and that is where it should be going.  I will work hard with Senator Gavan and others to make sure it goes that way and stays that way.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer and others talked about NPHET in view of the fact that it was disbanded suddenly this morning.  Colleagues have raised acceptance and delight at the fact that this time next week we will not have masks and the visible signs of Covid.  Others, such as Senators Flynn and Higgins, have talked about the fact that there still is an air of cautiousness among some people.  As a society, we need to make sure that we recognise both.  There are people who will be gleeful next week and there are people who will still be scared and vulnerable.  We need to make sure we look after those who are scared and vulnerable but also try to genuinely get down to whatever the new normal will be as quickly as we possibly can.<\/p><p>Senators Murphy and Currie talked about the work hub.  Senator Currie spoke about the connected hubs and the extra 200 we are getting over the coming years, which will be great.  Senator Murphy also sought a debate on the flooding of the River Shannon, which I will organise as quickly as I can.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan brought up the protests in Canada and I will try to organise that debate on a Thursday afternoon in the coming weeks because it would be interesting to do that.  The Senator is right and she mentioned last week that there was little coverage of its so maybe it is a good time to bring it up.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about the Uyghur World Congress visit this morning.  I note with interest the lovely email we got and I thank the Senator for his reply, which was well drafted.  There is no reason not to shine a light when human rights violations are being made and to sing about them insofar as they should not be done in the quiet or in close corners.<\/p><p>Senator Flynn asked for a debate on direct provision, which we will organise.<\/p><p>Senators Sherlock, Martin and Craughwell, among others, talked about Ukraine and the sanctions I hope will be announced at some point in the afternoon.  Each of them are right that the sanctions need to be as loud and reactive to the intolerable actions of the Russians last night as possible.  They should not be tolerated by any part of a functional, normal and democratic society.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell showed his dismay at the cost of the 945 pairs of socks.

Streaming services are now a key feature of everyday life.  They are on our phones, laptops and televisions.  However, regulation of these editorially controlled services has not kept pace with the regulation of broadcasting services.  This Bill will change that and ensure that streaming services are subject to up-to-date rules.<\/p><p>While the fact the Internet is a key part of our lives has become increasingly apparent, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought sharp focus to this reality.  From working from home to schooling from home, the Internet has enabled us to weather this pandemic in ways that have surprised us all.  While the Internet has had a broadly positive impact, there are risks, however, especially to children.  Some of these risks are online extensions of existing problems, such as bullying.  Others represent new challenges in our digital age, such as image-based abuse.  While we have updated our criminal law for the online age, there has not yet been a way to hold online services to account.  These are key matters this Bill will begin to tackle for the first time.  As such, the Bill's scope is ambitious and includes updates to the regulation of broadcasting services, including radio, television and streaming services.  It also provides for the creation of a new regulatory framework for online safety to tackle the availability of the most serious forms of harmful online content.  This will be done by providing for risk-based regulation of services that facilitate access to user-generated content.  In doing this, the Bill also provides for the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive into Irish law.<\/p><p>The foundations for achieving this ambition are those elements of the Bill that provide for the creation of a new regulatory body, coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, the media commission, which will implement and enforce these new and updated rules.  In order to do so, an coimisi&uacute;n will have a robust and modern suite of regulatory functions and powers and, in line with EU law and best practice, will be wholly independent in its exercise of those functions and powers.  Regulatory independence is key to effective regulation, especially for content regulation, where fundamental rights are so important.  In some parts of Europe, this independence is being eroded.  It is vital that Ireland leads on this issue.<\/p><p>The powers of an coimisi&uacute;n include the power to fund its operations by levying the services it regulates; to create legally binding regulatory codes; to gather information and appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations; and to seek the imposition of sanctions for failures of compliance, including financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is higher.  In the most serious cases, an coimisi&uacute;n may seek criminal prosecution of senior executives of non-compliant services and seek court orders to block access to a service in Ireland.  In respect of broadcasters, an coimisi&uacute;n will retain the power to revoke broadcasting contracts for serious breaches.<\/p><p>An coimisi&uacute;n will also take over the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  The staff of the BAI, approximately 40 people, will transfer to an coimisi&uacute;n.  I envisage that an coimisi&uacute;n will need to scale quickly up to a staffing level of at least 160 and in the longer term may require staffing of up to 300.  The Government has approved the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n on an administrative basis, including recruitment of key personnel, prior to the enactment of this Bill.  Work on this is ongoing between my officials, the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>While the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n primarily relate to the regulation of services, it will also have wider roles relating to the protection of children, research, education, media literacy, and journalistic and creative supports.  In carrying out these roles, an coimisi&uacute;n will support and promote an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment.  There is a widespread problem with the availability of harmful and criminal content on widely used online services.  It is clear that self-regulation in online safety is not working and that oversight and accountability is required.  As regards online safety, the Bill requires an coimisi&uacute;n to regulate video-sharing platform services in line with the directive.  In addition, the Bill provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to designate further online services for regulation from a pool of relevant online services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Catherine Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In this context, an online service is relevant if it facilitates access to user-generated content.  This covers a very wide range of services, including social media services, many gaming services and online messaging and storage services.  In order to designate an online service, an coimisi&uacute;n is required to conduct a risk assessment of the service, including regarding the prevalence of harmful online content available through the service and the nature and scale of the service.  This approach will enable an coimisi&uacute;n to direct its energies to the areas where they are most needed.<\/p><p>Once an online service is designated, an coimisi&uacute;n can require it to comply with binding online safety codes.  These codes can require online services to adapt their systems and processes in three key areas which are rules for content moderation and complaints handling; rules regarding the design of the service and how and why it displays certain content to users; and rules about advertising.<\/p><p>With regard to video-sharing platform services, an coimisi&uacute;n is required to apply the provisions of the directive to those services through these codes. The main aim of the online safety codes is to tackle and progressively reduce the availability of harmful online content on designated online services.  In this regard, the Bill clearly defines harmful online content.  Online content is harmful where it either relates to one of 40 criminal offences listed in the Bill, or is cyberbullying, the promotion or encouragement of eating disorders, self-harm or suicide, or makes available knowledge of methods of self-harm or suicide.<\/p><p>The schedule of criminal offences includes the offences under Coco's Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, with regard to image-based abuse, abusive communications and harassment.  For harmful online content which is not criminal in nature, a risk test must be met for it to be considered harmful.  This includes whether the online content gives rise to any risk to a person's life or a reasonably-foreseeable risk to a person's mental or physical health.  The Bill also provides for a mechanism for future categories of harmful online content, both criminal and non-criminal, to be added to this list, subject to Oireachtas oversight.<\/p><p>The Bill also requires an coimisi&uacute;n to create a super-complaints scheme, under which nominated bodies such as expert NGOs can formally notify an coimisi&uacute;n of a range of online safety issues.  In addition, the Bill empowers an coimisi&uacute;n to audit the handling of complaints by designated online services.<\/p><p>In summary, the online safety elements of this Bill will ensure that an individual person will be exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made.  In this regard, an coimisi&uacute;n will have significant powers of compliance and sanction to hold these services to account.<\/p><p>As the Members will be aware, I have established an expert group to examine providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill.  The role of the expert group is to examine whether it is practicable to do this and, if so, how it may be done.  The group has 90 days from the date of its first meeting, which was on 31 January 2022, to examine this matter and to report back to me with its recommendations.  Following this, I will then consider tabling an amendment as the Bill passes through the Oireachtas.  If an individual complaints mechanism can be provided for, I would like to ensure that it is.  In this regard, any proposals that I bring forward must be workable and legally robust.<\/p><p>In terms of the regulation of broadcasting and streaming services, this will for the most part be done through media codes and rules.  Media codes are mostly about the content of programming, including rules for programme standards and advertising.  Media rules, on the other hand, are mostly about the presentation and structure of the service, including rules regarding the time given to advertising, accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities and quotas for European works.  In order to ensure the uninterrupted regulation of broadcasters, provision is made for the existing broadcasting codes and rules to be carried over and become media codes and rules.<\/p><p>The Bill also provides for the mandatory registration of streaming services to ensure that, in line with the directive, all streaming services established in Ireland are subject to appropriate regulation.  Broadcasters will remain regulated on a contractual basis.  The Bill also provides for the transposition of an optional provision in the directive to empower an coimisi&uacute;n to levy broadcasters and streaming services, including those established elsewhere in the EU, in respect of any revenues that they may make in Ireland in order to fund the production of European works, including Irish-produced works.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Provision is made so that the money collected could be dispersed by an coimisi&uacute;n through a content production scheme.<\/p><p>The Bill does not set the amounts of any such levy as this would be inflexible but enables an coimisi&uacute;n to design and implement a levy having regard to relevant economic factors.  There are potential risks and benefits to a levy, including for consumers, and it is intended that an coimisi&uacute;n would thoroughly examine these matters before these provisions are commenced.<\/p><p>Turning to a more detailed overview of the provisions of the Bill, it is first important to note that it amends the Broadcasting Act 2009.<\/p><p>Part 1 addresses preliminary and general matters.<\/p><p>Part 2 amends the 2009 Act to insert and amend a number of definitions, including key definitions such as the definition of a \"relevant online service\".  Furthermore, sections 4 and 5 under this part provide for the relevant jurisdiction rules from the directive.<\/p><p>Part 3 amends Part 2 of the 2009 Act to provide for the establishment of Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.  Key provisions under this part include provision for the independence of an coimisi&uacute;n, the appointment of commissioners, including a chairperson, an coimisi&uacute;n to impose levies on regulated services - not including community broadcasters - to fund its operations, an coimisi&uacute;n to report on its operations and the accountability of the chairperson to the Committee of Public Accounts and the chairperson and other commissioners to relevant Oireachtas committees.<\/p><p>Part 3 also provides for the general powers and functions of an coimisi&uacute;n.  It is important to note that this provision does not contain every power and function to be exercised by an coimisi&uacute;n but does set out, at a high-level, certain powers and functions that an coimisi&uacute;n shall exercise and matters that it shall take into account when exercising its powers.  This includes upholding Ireland's democratic values, protecting the interests of the public, in particular children, ensuring the diverse needs of the people of this island are served by our media, stimulating content production, particularly in respect of the Irish language and climate matters and sustaining independent and impartial journalism.  In particular, an coimisi&uacute;n  is provided with a strong education and research role.<\/p><p>Part 4 provides for matters related to the registration of providers of streaming services through the insertion of a new Part 3A into the 2009 Act.<\/p><p>Part 5 concerns the duties, codes and rules applicable to radio and television broadcasters and streaming services and provides for these through the insertion of a new part 3B into the 2009 Act.  Chapter 2 of this new Part concerns duties, including in relation to privacy, news and current affairs and advertising.  Chapters 3 and 5 of this new part concern media codes and rules.  Chapter 3 of this Part also provides that existing broadcasting codes and rules made by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, such as access rules, will continue in force following the enactment of the Bill.<\/p><p>Part 6 amends Part 4 of the 2009 Act and primarily concerns changes to take into account the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n and the statutory regulation of streaming services in respect of redress mechanisms.<\/p><p>Part 9 amends Part 7 of the 2009 Act to take into account the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n in regard to public service broadcasting, allow for the part-funding of the broadcasting functions of an coimisi&uacute;n from television licence receipts, provide for changes to the calculation of total advertising time for broadcasters and insert a new chapter 7 regarding the availability and prominence of public service programmes and services.<\/p><p>Part 11 inserts a new Part 8A into the 2009 Act concerning online safety regulation.  Chapter 1 of this new part concerns the definitions of harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content, which I have already detailed.  Chapter 2 concerns the process for designating relevant online services for regulation.  Chapter 3 concerns the making of online safety codes, the matters which they can address and matters which need to be taken into account when the codes are being drawn up, including the protection of children, fundamental rights, the nature and scale of online services and the impact of automated decision-making or algorithms.  Chapter 4 concerns the making of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices.  Chapter 5 concerns an obligation on an coimisi&uacute;n to establish a super-complaints scheme for nominated bodies, and a number of other matters.  Part 11 also inserts a new Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act containing the list of offence specific categories of harmful online content.<\/p><p>Part 12 inserts a new Part 8B into the 2009 Act concerning investigations and sanctions.  Chapter 2 and of this new Part provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to appoint authorised officers and concerns the procedure for investigations by those officers and decisions by an coimisi&uacute;n following investigations.  Chapter 4 concerns the imposition of administrative financial sanctions.  Chapter 5 of this new Part provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to issue notices to end a contravention and provides for secondary criminal liability for senior executives linked to these.  Chapter 6 provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to seek court orders to block access to non-compliant online services in Ireland.  Chapter 7 provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to issue content limitation notices in respect of individual items of harmful online content.  Chapter 8 provides for three categories of summary offences under the Bill and provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to prosecute these offences.  This part also inserts a new Schedule 4 into the 2009 Act concerning oral hearings.<\/p><p>Parts 7, 8, 10, 13, 15 and 17 amend various Parts of the 2009 Act and other relevant Acts to take into account the dissolution of the BAI and the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n.<\/p><p>Part 14 inserts a new Part 10A in the 2009 Act concerning European works.  This Part provides for the requirements of the directive for European works quotas and prominence and provides an coimisi&uacute;n with the power to introduce a European works levy and European works scheme.<\/p><p>Lastly, Part 16 provides for transitional matters.<\/p><p>As can be seen, given its subject matter, this Bill is necessarily complex and far-reaching.  It deals with a wide range of important issues from modernising media regulation to introducing, for the first time, online safety regulation to tackle the availability of serious forms of harmful online content.<\/p><p>I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work undertaken by the members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media on the general scheme of the Bill as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  The report of the committee demonstrated the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny to the democratic process.  I was pleased to address a significant number of the recommendations made by the joint committee through the Bill.  As we now progress through the next phase of parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill, I look forward to the Senators' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#CC00900","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.

There is much at stake and the Minister and her officials must be commended on the prioritised emphasis she and they have placed on drafting a Bill that is so far-reaching in its scale and ambition.  The Government of this day ought to be commended too on supporting the need for this initiative.<\/p> <p>Undoubtedly, once enacted, the Bill will be very impactful.  I welcome the extent of the pre-legislative scrutiny that colleagues undertook at the Oireachtas committee.  I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the majority of their recommendations within the report.  It is a good example of the vital work Members of the Oireachtas do; often away from the glare of publicity.  They go through legislation word for word, line by line.  At times, I regret that it can be used as a box-ticking exercise but one cannot say that in respect of this Bill, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 and many others.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

I acknowledge some areas are still under consideration by the Minister, in particular the establishment of the working group on an individual complaints mechanism.  Public confidence and trust, which are hugely lacking in the current self-regulatory framework will be essential within this consideration.  Many concerned stakeholders are waiting for years, more than a decade.  I am delighted the Minister, the Department and the Government are moving ahead, as they are today.<br\/><br\/>The technical and operational challenges to individual complaints should be acknowledged.  A potential reach of more than 450 million people across Europe is a vast user base.  It is difficult to comprehend how the Irish regulator might handle such a structure and potential workload, but if there is a way to allow for a process whereby individual complaints can be reviewed, then it would be prudent of the Minister to take time for further analysis of this issue.  I welcome her decision to expedite the work of the group to just 90 days.  I acknowledge that any solutions presented must be legally robust.  I look forward to hearing the recommendations in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Our children and their safety are the driving force and momentum for all of us when considering the Bill.  Evidence, both data-driven and anecdotal, tell us that children are at daily risk of exposure to many types of harmful online material, from criminal harms to other harms such as bullying, harassment, exploitation and content that promotes suicide or eating disorders.  The tech companies make vast sums of money through their products and parents cannot be expected to be singlehandedly responsible and accountable for supervising their children at all times from accessing these platforms whose tentacles reach into almost every aspect of our everyday lives.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the online safety code framework established by the coimisi&uacute;n.  It will ensure that services take appropriate systemic measures to reduce the availability of harmful online content, including cyberbullying.  At long last, the tech companies will be held to tangible account.  The online services will be forced to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made.<br\/><br\/>I recognise that both society and business welcome the important development of this Bill.  Technology companies, many of whom are established in Ireland and have had great positive impact on our lives and have made a contribution to the economy, and employ thousands, will also play their part in putting the legislation into action in its implementation or, if they do not, face unprecedented, tough sanctions from the coimisi&uacute;n.<br\/><br\/>It should be acknowledged that there is a widespread problem with the availability of illegal and harmful content on widely used online services and it is clear that self-regulation is not working.  Today heralds the start of the journey to end the era of self-regulation.  The days of self-regulation are numbered.  They have failed us and our children.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Minister's work on the Bill in transposing the audiovisual media service directive, which places the focus of media regulation on both broadcasters and streaming services.  How audiences consume content at home and on mobile devices has changed dramatically.  I welcome this legislation which moves to adopt structures to recognise the need for expanded oversight.<br\/><br\/>As a firm believer in the power of democracy, disinformation is one of the defining issues of our time.  The spread and amplification of disinformation by social media in global politics is creating a demand for alternative narratives.  The influence of fake news has become an acute threat to democratic societies.  Why has the Bill not addressed this key issue?  Does the Minister have a process in place to tackle this once the online safety commissioner is <i>in situ<\/i>?  The impact of this legislation is to be felt right across the spectrum of society which interacts so frequently with audiovisual content and social media.  It is recognised that further legislation will be required in order to keep pace with the changing landscape of media and technology, but it is vitally important for us to get the foundation right.  The development of this Bill has, understandably, been complex and challenging.  It is evident from the physical weight of the Bill that it is a mammoth project.  It contains much detail.  It should be recognised that Ireland is paving the way for the rest of the world.  The Bill will benefit from its journey through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I look forward to actively partaking in the journey in the Upper House.  The days of self-regulation are numbered and I unequivocally welcome that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#FF00300","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Martin.

The Bill has been in the works for some time and will bring about drastic change for people and companies working in broadcasting and streaming.  It will affect everyone in the country in some way.  It is a large Bill and at times a technical one, but its main effects are laid out in an accessible manner.  It will result in the replacement of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland with the new Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, whose remit will extend beyond that of the BAI into the realm of audiovisual on-demand media services or streaming to the layman, and also into social media, which the Bill calls a relevant online service for the time being.<\/p> <p>I am going to stick to some of the terms that everybody knows.  This Bill comes about because of a debate that has happened in the western hemisphere in recent years.  It was largely kick-started in 2016 by the cultural fallout from Brexit and the presidential election in the United States, the crux of which was that people behaved poorly online and what was to be done about it.  This primarily is a moral issue; someone with no love of neighbour does not care what harm they bring to others, but since we cannot legislate that everyone be moral, then here we are.<\/p> <p>I will take some aspects of the Bill in order of appearance.  Section 35, which amends section 123 of the principal Act, allows the commission to receive funding from the television licence fee, joining RT&Eacute; and TG4 as the recipients of such.  I do not know how TG4 feels about sharing the pie, but RT&Eacute; has spent recent years having a good moan about how the &euro;200 million a year that gets spent from the fee is simply not enough.  It has continually held out the begging bowl to successive Governments.  Most companies, families and individuals might have to look at costs and expenses and engage in a bit of budgeting to make ends meet when times are tough, but then for most companies, it is not illegal to not pay for the service that you did not ask for and do not use.  There was some talk of a broadcasting levy which would be applied to every household, rather than only those with a television.  Let us all be glad that was not the route taken.  Instead, we are going to put a levy on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and Disney Plus - the companies that make the content that people want to pay for - and radio stations and social media companies, which they will pay to the commission for the privilege of being regulated in the hope that some money will be put in their coffers.<\/p> <p>Part 2 of the Bill is where things get more worrying than ridiculous.  It relates to online safety.  Before I talk about harmful online content, I want to mention section 139D, which relates to age-inappropriate online content.  I am so glad that it is in the Bill.  Very few parents have any idea of what children see online.  Children are given a phone, sometimes as young as six or seven, and they are left alone with it day and night with unrestricted Internet access.  That is not okay.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am so sick and tired of the blind eye being turned when it comes to the harm this is doing to the children the length and breadth of this country.  From constant exposure to cyberbullying, to unrealistic body imagery for young girls leading to low self-esteem and eating disorders, to one-click access to hard-core pornography which desensitises, to the oversexualisation of young people, to direct messages from anonymous accounts on TikTok, Instagram and Discord, asking them for photos.  The list goes on and on.  Parents are not doing their job at protecting their children from the Internet.  That is a fact.  This will not be a very popular statement, because we do not like to criticise parents, but this is too important, and we must call it out.  That, of course, is the role of the parent; to raise, nurture and protect their child.  It is less so the relationship between the Government and its citizens and yet, that is what the Government is seeking to do with this Bill.  It is to make the media commission the saviour of grown adults nationwide by saving them from offence.<\/p><p>Alongside the serious issues of self-harm, suicide and eating disorders is the definition of \"harmful online content\" as online content which \"humiliates another person\".  Under this Bill, if someone tweets something which I feel humiliates me, I can ask Twitter to take it down.  If it does not do so, I can go to the media commission, tell the commission that it is negatively impacting my mental health and the commission will order it to be taken down.  This is the teacher making sure that the kids play nice in the yard, scaled up to the entire online presence of everyone in the country.<\/p><p>Bullying is a different story.  It carries with it the idea of behaviour that is targeted and repeated.  There is no such provision in this Bill.  There can be a once-off occasion and, just like that, this organ of the State will swoop in and make sure that no one&rsquo;s feelings ever get hurt.  The role of the State is to protect our rights, not our feelings.  We are in the very early Stages of this Bill.  I welcome the provisions of this Bill, particularly those that protect our children.  However, I also have serious concerns on the possible overreach of the commission in restricting freedom of speech online.  I look forward to working with the proposers on Committee Stage, when I will table amendments to ensure the continued existence of freedom of speech in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#GG00300","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome and all the more so because she is bringing forward one of the most far-reaching and significant pieces of legislation ever seen in these Houses.  It is much needed for the regulation of media in this modern age.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, I was delighted over the last year to have been working on that pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill, along with my colleagues, Senator Malcolm Byrne, and the Chair, Deputy Niamh Smyth.  We addressed the dozens of witnesses from many spheres of society that came before us, from media experts, to health experts, to young students who had been subjected to vile sexual abuse and sexual exploitation online.<\/p> <p>Now, we have a Bill to deal with the robust regulatory framework.  That is so welcome and I commend the Minister.  We now see the benefits of having a Minister with responsibility for the media, as well as of having a Department with responsibility for the media, in bringing forward legislation that is required.  However, here is the rub, which is bit like when Governments in the past took on the big, vested interests in the world, such as the tobacco industry.  We are facing, just like we did with tobacco in the past, tech giants which make profits that would make one's eyes water.  Facebook&rsquo;s profits are &euro;40 billion.  The ball is very much in these companies' court.  They are looking at this Bill very carefully, as we have seen from their appearance before us at the media committee.  The warnings by Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, at the weekend, when she spoke on RT&Eacute;, were that the world is depending on Ireland for a level of robustness that keeps people safe.  This is stark.<\/p> <p>Equally stark is her warning about what an online safety commissioner will need in terms of staff and expertise.  She said that it would need at least 20 algorithm experts with deep product expertise, who understand how small choices make parts of the system interact with each other.  If we do not have these experts, then we do not have a chance of holding these systems accountable.  Here is the problem.  Remember that there is no undergraduate course from which we can obtain these experts.  They exist and are trained only by the very tech giants that we are seeking to regulate.  In effect, we will have to break into Willy Wonka&rsquo;s chocolate factory and steal a couple of Oompa Loompas so that we can get the magic formula and take these guys on at their own game.  If we do not, we will get outflanked at every turn.  Just like Augustus Gloop, we will be stuck in the pipe, only ours will be a huge, high-speed fibre cable one.<\/p> <p>I am very positive about this Bill.  More so, I have been heartened by all those who came before us and spoke to us at the committee.  Not all of the voices were those that predicted doom and gloom.  Many young people and students spoke to us about the dangers of over-regulation.  They said that a process of education and support is needed in our education system.  They nearly half-scolded us.  They said that teachers and parents need to understand the world as it is, as opposed to the world in which we grew up.  This should not be an over-regulated world.<\/p> <p>We also had students before the committee.  One in particular case, Alicia O&rsquo;Sullivan, the law student from UCC, had her image used on a fake Instagram account.  Several of the posts were nude images of girls, without their faces visible.  The account&rsquo;s creators falsely purported that these images were of Alicia.  One of the most frustrating things was her interaction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when she reported it.  Garda&iacute; were kind of looking at her as if to say, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; and they were asking her about what kinds of images she posted herself.  They did not have the expertise.  They were not trained in this whole area and sphere to be able to deal with her complaint properly.  Hence the need for the individual complaints mechanism in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, so that we have a proper area whereby complaints can be dealt with.  <\/p> <p>On the issue of health - and this is such a broad-ranging Bill - we had the Irish Heart Foundation before the committee.  Its representatives described as worrying the absence of a ban on junk food advertisements aimed at children.  Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony, the special rapporteur on child protection, spoke of the dangers of targeted gambling advertisements, which is quite frankly one of the biggest threats in our society today.  They are one of the biggest advertisers in the online world.  Trust me, they have their own batch of Oompa Loompas working in the back offices who are targeting susceptible people and are creating case files on their big clients and big gamblers so that they can keep them hooked.  These people have unlimited resources to make sure that they are using the online world for financial gain. <\/p> <p>We met with Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and Instagram at our hearings.  They were terse exchanges.  They did not come skipping to the table to meet us.  We subsequently met with representatives from Facebook privately online to discuss community standards.  We came away even more despairing after that, given our differences in interpretation of what was regarded as acceptable content, versus what was not.  Hence, it reinforced my backing for, and my belief in, the need for regulation, as well as for a complaints mechanism.  Only 3% to 5% of hate speech on Facebook is picked up through its artificial intelligence filters, and only 1% of violent inciting content.  What was most worrying about comments by Frances Haugen, who will be before the media committee tomorrow, is her claim that Facebook now rewards hate content.  It will target and promote content that elicits reaction when people are thrashing each other, when they are fighting back and forth, when they are getting that engagement and when people are pressing \"like\".  That is very depressing.  <\/p> <p>This Bill obviously has broader implications for the total world of media, because it will dissolve the existing regulator and will provide the commission with the powers and functions to an appropriate apply and enforce review framework.  The issue of the content levy, of which the Minister spoke, under section 157 has, as the Minister says, pros and cons.  However, ensuring that we have a fund for original Irish content is essential, as we discussed at the committee.  I would echo the comments of Screen Producers Ireland which is looking at a definitive start date for that content levy.  We have been discussing this for a very long time.  We need to see progress and a date for that. <\/p> <p>We also had the traditional media providers before us, because their future is under threat.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Shane Cassells:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Content from newsrooms is being used for free online.  Just as Johannes Gutenberg put the monks out of business in 1440 when he invented the printing press, I am not trying to hold back the tide.  I worked in the print industry for 20 years and I can see that the game is changing.  The press needs to try to make people buy newspapers again, but we need to address the future of the media.  Hence, we need the report of the Future of Media Commission so that we can have that debate in tandem with this Bill.  They have a complementary aspect.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well and look forward to the Bill progressing to Committee Stage.  Today is a major step, on which I commend the Minister.  It is important for the future of the media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#HH00200","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I offer my apologies on behalf of Senator Carrigy.  Over the past year and a half, he has worked hard on the committee with colleagues.  Unfortunately, he cannot make it today.  I am happy to fill in for him because this is an issue in which I have taken a personal interest for the past 18 months in terms of big tech and the algorithms that are being used.  I watched Ms Frances Haugen's testimony to the US Congress, the European Parliament and the House of Commons.  Given how big tech has been so beneficial, Ms Haugen going around the world and giving personal testimony to parliaments shows how important this matter is.<\/p><p>I wish to set out the context for why we are introducing legislation like this.  It has to do with the US and section 230 of its Communications Decency Act of 1996.  It was one of the world's first Internet Acts and came about to provide news websites that had comment sections with immunity against libellous comments.  It made sense at the time because we were in a new era and did not know what it was.  Now, big tech companies like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube hide behind that section because they can define themselves as platforms as opposed to publishers.  When they are not treated as publishers, they are not responsible for the content - much of the time, it is hateful content - that is posted on their sites.  The loophole they use is to say that they are only hosting the content and are not responsible for it.  The minute that social media and big tech companies become responsible for the content on their platforms, the sooner they will take greater care towards it.<\/p><p>We have needed to introduce legislation like this because they have failed to self-regulate regardless of all the times they have said they are doing this or that.  It would not make sense for them to self-regulate because doing so would fundamentally alter their business model.  Like any business, their business model is to try to make a profit.  Why on Earth would Mark Zuckerberg or other people in big tech turn around and alter their algorithms to make them safer for people and, in the process, lose money?  It will not happen.  That is why it is so important for governments to step in and legislate.  That is what the Irish Government is doing today and what the EU is doing with the Digital Services Act.  In the US, trying to repeal section 230 was the one thing that the former President, Donald Trump, and Democrats could agree on.  There are moves in the US Congress to do that now.  It would be a decent approach.  That is the context for where we find ourselves today.<\/p><p>Something else that we have to understand and acknowledge is that big tech moves at lightning speed and is changing every week.  It is difficult for the government in any democracy to try to keep pace with that.  We are trying to do so with this Bill, but it is important that we build mechanisms into the legislation so that we can review it every year.  There is no point in just passing it, putting it on the Statute Book and forgetting about it for four or five years.  Since big tech is an ever-evolving system, it will have to be monitored rigorously and continuously.  As my colleague, Senator Cassells, said when referencing Ms Haugen on RT&Eacute; over the weekend, we must have people in the commission who are experts in algorithms and in how big tech works.  We need to pursue big tech employees to work for us and help us shine a light on what these companies are doing.  The commission needs the highest quality personnel.  Otherwise, I fear that it will not be as successful as it could be.<\/p><p>I will turn to a few other aspects.  I welcome the Minister's comments on an individual complaints mechanism and that she will revert to us 90 days after 31 January.  I understand why some people may baulk at the concept of an individual complaints mechanism.  For example, if I fell out with Senator Warfield or Senator Keogan, anyone could report a comment on this and that.  The mechanism will not work if it is being abused by people who are using it just because they do not like what so and so said.  However, it allows for action to be taken where someone has clear evidence of sustained harassment or abuse over a distinct period.  At the moment, what can an individual who is being harangued, abused or harassed online do?  He or she can go to the Garda or take the offenders through a costly, time-consuming and laborious legal process.  However, if someone is able to make a direct complaint to the commission about an individual who is clearly targeting a certain section of society or so on, then that individual can be blocked from a platform or sanctions of some sort can be applied.  Importantly, this would provide people with reassurance that there is an avenue to make such complaints and that they would be backed up in doing so.<\/p><p>We have discussed misinformation.  Last week, I read a good article in <i>The Economist<\/i>about big tech and misinformation.  It had a really good cartoon depicting the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who are traditionally Famine, Death, War and Conquest.  Three of those are matters that previous societies had to contend it, but perhaps the 21st century has to contend with a fifth horseman, namely, misinformation.  Misinformation is being used around the world to try to destabilise economies and democracies and undermine vaccines and Covid responses.  It is being allowed to run amok online.  This was shown a couple of years ago when Facebook's algorithms took people down rabbit holes.  If people searched for a certain thing, it would produce another level of that content and then another level, and they would go further and further down the rabbit hole.  There is an excellent podcast from <i>The New York Times<\/i>called &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot;.  It details exactly how these algorithms worked.  After the lid was blown on the story, Facebook all of a sudden said it needed to do something about it.  This is why we cannot trust big tech companies whatsoever.<\/p><p>I went off on a slight tangent there, so I will return to my point on misinformation.  The Department of Education and the commission could examine a good approach that Finland has been taking since 2014.  That year, Finland came under a large cyberattack from Russia over perceived grievances.  As a result, Finland's department of education introduced misinformation classes in which it showed primary school children what online misinformation was, how to identify it and how to react to it.  If we did something like that to prepare Irish children for the online world, which is different than when some of us were younger, it would go a long way.<\/p><p>The reason we must introduce this legislation is because it would be insane for us to rely on big tech companies to regulate themselves.  It will never happen.  They have tried to do it.  Actually, to be honest, I do not really think that they have tried to do it.  They have only tried after the lid was blown on some of their practices.  They then give mealy-mouthed responses about what they are trying to do.  Until the business model of big tech changes &ndash; the companies will never change it themselves &ndash; governments will have to step in and regulate.  This Bill will be the first such legislation to be introduced and will be followed by other democracies around the world.<\/p><p>It is important that we review the legislation every year.  If we do not, we will not be able to keep up with the lightning speed of big tech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#JJ00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Senator Cassells will shortly take over for me in the Chair.

It is a source of significant frustration that she has yet to publish the Future of Media Commission's report.  The co-operation and synergy between the commission and the new regulator were core issues for the joint committee when debating this Bill.  Here we are discussing the dissolution of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, yet the Parliament does not have to hand a report from the commission, which was set up by the Government at a cost to taxpayers in the State of &euro;400,000.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I asked RT&Eacute; representatives when they were before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media recently how they felt.  They said they were beyond frustrated that the report has not been published yet.  The Press Ombudsman was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Petitions, of which I am a member, and he expressed his concern that it had not been published yet.  The committee pre-legislative scrutiny report noted the notable overlap between the Future of Media Commission and the new regulator.  I urge the Minister to release the report to tell us what the Government's plan is for the future of media in this country. <\/p><p>I will turn to the individual complaints mechanism.  The Internet brings risk.  This Bill has identified the loss of personal data, exposure to harmful content, cyberbullying, negative effects on health and mental health, online grooming and extortion.  There is a scheme in the Bill for nominated bodies that will be able to notify the media commission about harmful content and non-compliance with the online safety codes.  However, that does not go far enough.  The Bill should specifically provide for an individual complaints mechanism to ensure citizens have access to an effective remedy.  When someone's rights are not respected by online providers, and that person has exhausted all appropriate channels with an online platform, the State should then have a mechanism in place to allow an effective remedy for the individual.  I appreciate the Minister has established an expert group to consider the issue.  It will report to her before 90 days at this point, but this work should have been completed in parallel with the pre-legislative scrutiny process.<\/p><p>I hope the Bill will not leave the Seanad before we get access to the advice from the expert group.  It is important for Senators to be able to consider the Bill with the advice from that expert group to hand.  I hope the Bill will not go to the D&aacute;il, be amended there and then return to this House.  While I welcome the piece about nominated bodies, I am not convinced such organisations, for example, NGOs, have the time or resources to do this type of work.  Having super-complainants is a useful provision, and one I understand social media companies have in place, but it is no harm to put that on a legislative footing.<\/p><p>I will refer briefly to public service programming and prominence.  It is something I brought up at the committee at numerous points.  The prominence of our public service broadcasters and public service media must be safeguarded in law.  This is particularly important when it comes to the Irish language.  We used to be able to turn on the television and the public service broadcaster would be right there.  It now takes multiple steps to find public service content.  It is important we maintain prime billing on viewing menus, for example, so the regulator can step in and ensure public service content is easy to find.  As I said, there are multiple steps a viewer has to take to find public service content now, whether that is through a Sky box and so on.  I do not want a situation where public service broadcasters are being drowned out.<\/p><p>The new media commission will have the power to impose financial sanctions on broadcasting services and designated online services.  I am mindful when I read these sanctions that another commissioner, the Data Protection Commissioner, has come in for international criticism for being too soft on big tech companies such as Facebook and Google.  Ms Frances Haugen said that Ireland faces a conflict of interest when regulating these companies.  The Government needs to get tough and this media commission needs to be tough on tech companies.  I am also concerned that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Robert Troy, has given confidentiality to Facebook and other tech companies when they meet that Department. <\/p><p>I would like to raise the issue of the ban on advertising to children.  I remember the Connemara film-maker, Bob Quinn, always fought against advertisements during children's programming when he was on the RT&Eacute; authority.  In 1970, he called for a complete ban on all advertising directed at children.  Recommendation 24 from the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report is a ban on advertising to children online, including, at the very minimum, advertising of junk foods, alcohol, foods high in fat, salt or sugar, and gambling.  There should be an online safety code that addresses this issue.  I believe an explicit reference is required that makes it clear from the outset this will be included in the work of the new regulator because it is in public health interest of children.  The same applies to the content levy.  The media regulator will have the ability to introduce the levy but there is no date for that.  Does the Minister believe it will happen if we leave it and do not make explicit reference to its introduction at the start of the Bill?<\/p><p>My last point relates to public interest research based on the data provided by regulated platforms.  Ms Frances Haugen was a product manager researching misinformation on Facebook's civil integrity team.  She will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media tomorrow.  She disclosed internal documents showing Facebook's internal research teams had evidence of harmful content.  Facebook did not share those findings with the public nor did it give external researchers access to data to confirm their findings.  We need transparent data access.  Researchers can only access what Facebook wants them to see.  Researchers can see patterns on Twitter because its data is public, but Facebook and YouTube do not readily share data with researchers and, therefore, there is a void in research, which is the first step in understanding what is going on under the lid of these platforms.  Recommendation 23 from the committee was that provision be made in legislation to enable public interest research based on data provided by regulated platforms.  Is the Minister satisfied the Bill provides for data to be supplied to independent researchers and academics?  I do not think it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#JJ00400","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I welcome the Bill and when it is enacted, its impact will be groundbreaking.  It is a long overdue development that recognises the multiple media forms that now exist in our lives.  It is important to say the establishment of the new media commission and the three commissioners will be vital in forcing our regulatory system to deal with the enormous challenges posed by online activity and recognising, as many others have said, that for many people on-demand audiovisual services now overtake the main broadcast media in how they consume broadcast content.<\/p> <p>Before I go into the detail of the Bill, it is important to acknowledge the enormous work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  I am not a member of that committee - I have sat in on its meetings a number of times - but I am certainly aware of the extensive number of hearings and the very detailed report and recommendations issued by it.  While some of the committee's recommendations were incorporated into the Bill before us, a number of them were not.  I am also conscious of the commitments to address some of the outstanding concerns, such as the report that has been commissioned into the individual complaints mechanism.  There are also concerns with regard to how much detail in the Bill relates to the online safety commissioner.  These are not peripheral but core issues.  There is a real question about the timing of this Bill coming before the House when these fundamental issues have not yet been fully addressed.  Like others, I would like these issues to be fully addressed and brought back to the House before this Bill is passed.  I hope it is not rushed through this House and into the D&aacute;il before those issues are fully resolved.<\/p> <p>Others have spoken about the issue of the absence of the individual complaints mechanism.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To me there is a real issue about the point of this Bill if it cannot facilitate meaningful and direct recourse for those affected by online safety issues.  We have heard from groups like the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, CyberSafeKids and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, all having concerns that failure to have an individual complaints mechanism will perpetuate the harm online and, in particular, will leave children and other vulnerable persons exposed and unprotected by this Bill.  While I recognise that there is a provision for expert groups and NGOs to report, unless there is a direct recourse for individuals then this Bill will be failing in what it sets out to do, namely provide regulation and support to those affected by harmful online activity.<\/p><p>The following point is important to me.  While regulation and sanction of harmful online content is the most groundbreaking element of this Bill, when I look at the detail there is also a lack of ambition in certain elements of it.  Why has the Government shied away from naming non-criminal, harmful content such as advertising to children of gambling products and of high-fat, high-salt and high-sugar food products?  Instead of being brave and hardwiring a Bill on advertising to children of these products, we are told that responsibility for the regulation of advertising of these products lies with their line Departments, namely the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Justice.  There is an inconsistency at the heart of the Bill because the responsibility for online safety is rightly placed within the media commission; the online safety commissioner will be tasked with regulating content to ensure the online safety of children and adults and when it comes to some of the thorniest and most harmful online exposure, responsibility is sent back to the Departments.  To be fair to the Departments they are looking after the commercial interests of food production companies and other enterprises.  We can hardly expect a Department other than the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to be a neutral arbiter on these issues, whereas we could expect an online safety commissioner and the media commission to have a strong role in this.  It is regrettable that outright bans are not named in this legislation.<\/p><p>The other big issue is the advertising of infant milk formula products.  A key point that has been made by the Baby Feeding Law Group Ireland is that this Bill should seek to protect all children and not just those who are old enough to consume digital or analogue advertising.  When I say all this, I recognise that there will always be demand for infant formula and mothers have a right to decide what is best for themselves and their families.  This is not about stigmatising choices but it is about protecting families from marketing that is purely driven by profit considerations, not by any interest in the advancement of public health.  That is why I strongly feel we should have an outright ban on the advertising of infant formula products for children up to the age of 36 months.  We know Ireland has been found wanting in comprehensively implementing the World Health Organization international code of marketing breastmilk substitutes and that we have had an ambivalent attitude towards the marketing of breast milk, marketing online and within some Irish hospitals.  There is an opportunity to introduce a ban within the legislation, not to commit to something that may be looked at down the road.  We also need to introduce a ban on the profiling or tracking of babies or children&rsquo;s data and anybody who has been pregnant over the last decade will tell you that if you become pregnant after a while your search history will start to throw up all sorts of advertising online.<\/p><p>The online world is only a safer place because of the incredible work of content moderators on various platforms.  Unfortunately we do not have any regulation of their work in this Bill.  While it could be argued that regulation of their work could be dealt with within health and safety legislation, the performance of content moderators is vital in the self-regulation of platforms in this country.  If we do not ensure that we have proper supports in place for self-regulation, that places an enormous pressure on the regulatory infrastructure, namely the media commission.  There is a serious need to look at how this Bill relates to content moderators.<\/p><p>I mention the overdue publication of the report of the Future of Media Commission..  There is a growing frustration that we have not seen that.  In my role as Labour Party spokesperson on media I talk to local and national media and we need to see that vision from Government.  I urge the Minister to press on with that publication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#KK00200","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She can hear the interest in this Bill as it is discussed.  For a long time there was a little bit of complacency among some of the major players in the tech industry around the idea that they would always be slightly ahead of Government and regulation and that this was an area of such complexity.  I remember being in a situation once when I was told that it is maths and that was used to say these areas are not in the scope of appropriate regulation.  We have seen that they are in the scope of appropriate regulation and that they are areas of responsibility for us as national and European legislators.<\/p><p>The online space does not exist separately; it exists in real spaces.  From the issues of data centres and where they are located, through to where and how data is processed, it is in the real world and in real jurisdictions and it is subject to real regulation.  We have instruments and the skills to do that regulation.  We have seen that in the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  We have heard about innovation and the regulatory innovation that Europe showed in GDPR was fundamental and incredibly important.  There is something we got right about that which I hope we can follow through with in how we treat the likes of the audiovisual and media services directive, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, the digital services and the algorithmic legislation when it comes through.  We took an approach with GDPR that avoided the twin dangers of a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach of market self-regulation and an authoritarian approach where the state owned all the data.  It is neither a matter of commercial nor state ownership.  Instead we took up an approach which was rights-based.  It was strong, regulatory, ambitious and also fundamentally rights-based.  We can do that here again and we need to make sure we do so, while improving the one place that GDPR has fallen down and where Ireland has unfortunately fallen down on GDPR, namely in implementation and enforcement.<\/p><p>In that context I will point to some of my recommendations and concerns, which will seem to go to either direction on this.  On the one side we need to be more ambitious in making sure that individuals are able to assert their data rights.  There must be an individual complaints mechanism and that will be core to this legislation, to its effectiveness and meaningfulness and to whether it sits legitimately side-by-side in a complementary way with what we did before.  There has to be an individual mechanism and in that I would suggest that we probably should not be looking at this on Committee Stage in the Seanad until we have that expert online safety group report back.  It was given 90 days from the end of January to report and its brief is to consider: &quot;whether it is practicable to include an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill and, if so, how this may be done.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022022200002#LL00200","speaker":"1662"}]
