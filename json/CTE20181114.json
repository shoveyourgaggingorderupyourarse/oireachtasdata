I will keep my opening comments brief.<\/p> <p>  The recent report published by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, highlighted the magnitude of the global challenge.  Addressing the threat of climate change is a priority for Government as is reflected in the programme for Government.  It is a whole-of-government issue that requires joined-up effort. <\/p> <p>  In her introduction to the Citizens' Assembly's third report, the chairperson acknowledged the topic of climate change is \"incredibly broad, wide-ranging and affects us all in one way or another\".  There is no single solution to addressing the challenge of climate change and a collaborative effort is required across Government involving a range of inter-related actions and actors.  A targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation policies and regulation are necessary to deliver upon our climate change objectives. <\/p> <p>  Tax policy has an important role to play in contributing to our decarbonisation objective but the complexity and need for balance in policy actions was recognised in the assembly&rsquo;s recommendations.  The qualification of recommendation No. 3 on taxes on carbon intensive activities referred to the need to protect the poorest households and a recognition, in ancillary recommendation No. 3, that the impact of the agriculture sector on the economy, particularly the rural economy, has to be taken account of in transitioning that sector towards models of production. <\/p> <p>  Taxation and pricing is a significant aspect of the contribution the Department can make in this regard.  Other issues include our ongoing work with our agencies such as the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign green bond, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, investment supporting green technology and the promotion of the sustainable and green finance sector as part of the work under IFS 2020. <\/p> <p>  Our existing taxation system is positively contributing to climate change.  The extent to which it can, and should, do more is a matter of ongoing policy discussion.  Recommendation No. 3 highlights an acceptance of paying higher taxes on carbon intensive activities, subject to the qualifications such as the spending of the increased revenue on measures to support the low-carbon transition.  The Government is committed, in the national mitigation plan, to carbon pricing as a part of the suite of policy measures to address and reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time. However, we also need to understand its impact on low-income households, on households for whom at present there is no realistic substitute to the consumption of carbon commodities for home heat and transport.  The assembly recognised this challenge for poorer households in its qualifications to the recommendation. <\/p> <p>  Understanding the impact of carbon pricing on emissions is imperative.  In this regard, the Department has worked with the ESRI and published a report in October 2018 that provides a better understanding of the environmental, social and economic impacts of increasing carbon tax rates.  It found that a doubling in carbon tax to &euro;40 per tonne would result in less than a 5% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, which is a positive impact from just one measure.  While this would be a positive contribution to our objective, it also underlines the importance of pursuing complementary policy levers in conjunction with taxation policy to support our transition to a low-carbon economy.<\/p> <p>  To build on this work, the ESRI is currently developing a multi-annual model to better inform our decision-making into the future which will be capable of modelling a carbon tax pathway which captures behavioural change on the part of producers and households alike in response to policy initiatives such as a phased increase in carbon tax rates over time.  On budget day the Government reaffirmed the intention to put in place a long-term trajectory for carbon tax increases out to 2030 in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, and this committee.  This is an explicit acknowledgement that carbon pricing and carbon tax, in particular, has a key role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. <\/p> <p>  In recommendation No. 9 of the report, the vast majority of members of the assembly recommended the State should immediately take steps to support the transition to electric vehicles.  To support the achievement of this goal, a number of tax incentives are in place to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles, EVs, and more carbon-efficient vehicles.  For example, in addition to the vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief of up to &euro;5,000 and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, purchase grant of up to &euro;5,000, which are in place, a 0% rate of benefit-in-kind, BIK, on EVs was introduced this year.  A new accelerated capital allowances scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment is being provided for in Finance Bill 2018, designed to encourage the uptake of gas-propelled commercial vehicles as an economic and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel.  Ireland's CO2 based VRT and motor tax have been redesigned towards incentivising the uptake of lower emissions technology, whereby the higher the emissions, the higher the tax.  This charging system was introduced in 2008.  In January 2013, a revised banding structure was also introduced for both motor tax and VRT to take account of technological differences.  A zero emissions band for electric vehicles was also introduced for motor tax purposes.  The introduction of these measures has been effective in influencing purchasing decisions in favour of more fuel efficient vehicles, with a significant increase in new vehicle purchases in the lower band categories.  In 2009, only 13% of vehicles registered were in the 0g to 120g band; it has not increased to 77%.  From virtually none, there are now approximately 4,000 electric vehicles on Irish roads.<\/p> <p>  The launch of Ireland&rsquo;s first sovereign green bond for &euro;3 billion by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, on 10 October is a significant development, as it will assist in funding the Exchequer investment committed.  While the proceeds of the bond are remitted like all other issues to the central fund, the yields will be channelled to projects with environmental benefits.  Eligible green project categories for the first Irish green bond issue include sustainable water and waste management, clean transportation, environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land use, renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate change adaptation projects.  The issuance of the bond was met with strong demand with a total order book of more than &euro;11 billion. <\/p> <p>  With regard to the imperative of mobilising private sector capital, I note the important work of IFS2020, which has included green and sustainable finance as a strategic priority in the 2018 action plan.  Last week, Sustainable Nation Ireland, which has a role under the IFS2020 strategy to support and promote Ireland as a green and sustainable finance hub, co-hosted this year&rsquo;s EU annual climate innovation summit.  The summit was held on 6 to 8 November and attended by more than 600 decision-makers from Ireland and Europe. <\/p> <p>  Officials from the Department have also worked closely with Deputy Pringle on the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016, which was passed by the D&aacute;il in July and which I believe is before the Seanad this week.  The Bill requires the NTMA, as custodian of the ISIF, to endeavour to ensure it does not directly invest in a fossil fuel undertaking and to divest from an investment which is or becomes a fossil fuel undertaking.<\/p><p>At a micro level but in keeping with recommendation No. 2 of the report on retrofitting and regeneration of public buildings, the recent renovation of the Department's offices in Government Buildings has resulted in annual electricity bill savings in the region of &euro;60,000 per annum.  In this redevelopment we were aware of the need to significantly reduce our energy footprint. <\/p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, which is an important aspect of the national dialogue on climate action.  Progress is being made, but we still have a long way to go with significant challenges ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":26,"content":"<p>It is a pleasure to be here.  As the committee will be aware, we have a significant challenge in respect of climate policy.  I will set out why we think this is, what we can do about it and the specific actions that are relevant to our Department.  The climate is a public good.  The story of modern humanity is one of its ability to conquer the elements but it is hard for us to conceive of a world radically altered by rising temperatures.  This perception gap collides with our well-known bias towards the immediate.  In general, we are bad at sacrificing now to benefit later.  This effect is compounded when it comes to climate change because we have never previously had to deal with a situation where the consequences of a problem are so far removed from the actions we must take to deal with it.  The price that will be paid for the emissions we release into the atmosphere today will be borne by our children and their children.  Naturally, Departments focus on the interests of the public and society.  The determination of the public interest is filtered through the views expressed by their stakeholders and, ultimately, the political system.  Due to our biases, we underestimate the impact of our current behaviour on the climate, and continue doing business as usual.  This <i>status quo<\/i>bias is reflected in our approach to climate policies.<br\/><br\/>The actions we have been pursuing to date have evolved to be compatible with existing policy priorities in a variety of areas rather than specifically aimed at delivering the change we need at the scale required.  We have pushed open doors in respect of certain policies where the evidence suggests that reductions in emissions on the scale required will involve significant winners and losses and have significant consequences for society.  I have described a well-recognised problem.  The adverse effects of emissions fall on society collectively rather than on those individually responsible for their emission.  They are external to the market or externalities.  There is not enough incentive for individuals, whether businesses or consumers, to reduce emissions.  The best way to address these externalities is to place a price on them.  The Europe-wide emissions trading scheme, ETS, is an attempt to do this for emissions in sectors, such as electricity generation and other high emitting sectors.  Given that every installation has to pay a price for every tonne of emissions it releases, it bears a direct cost for its emissions and is incentivised to find new and creative ways of reducing them.  Even with the flaws of the ETS, the impact of pricing carbon in power generation has seen emissions from that sector consistently decline across Europe.<br\/><br\/>With an effective mechanism in place for the ETS, the primary focus of policy is to reduce emissions in the non-ETS sectors where the liability for not compliance rests with the State.  Do we have enough least cost abatement options in the policy system?  The biases I have outlined translate into a basic principal-agent problem, which is significant in this area because responsibility for climate action rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, but responsibility for policies to reduce non-ETS emissions fall across many Departments and agencies.  Like other countries, we have structures in place to try to address this problem but we should consider whether these structures are likely to be sufficient or if they need to be complemented by more stringent central mandates or perhaps, even replaced by mechanisms such as making individual Departments or Ministers more directly responsible for specific emission reductions targets in their sectors.<br\/><br\/>Irrespective of the type of structures we have in place, we need to develop new climate policies and measures and we need methodologies to assess options across sectors.  There is no easy way of deciding whether we should prioritise actions in any one given sector.  That is why the first question that we should ask of any proposal is how does this initiative help us meet our climate targets and at what cost does it do so.  We need to know the marginal cost of abatement for potential options.  The committee has been discussing this in recent months.  Once we know where the economic opportunities are, we can have a proper discussion about the policy trade-offs and make progress in respect of the options we face.  As Mr. Moran outlined, carbon pricing through the ETS or taxation allows market discovery.  This mechanism allows market agents to establish least cost opportunities and provides them with the incentives to take appropriate action.  These market mechanisms may need to be supported by expenditure measures to encourage, for example, early adopters.  It may also be underpinned by regulations that can provide investment certainty to private consumers and businesses.  A tangible example in this area is Government policy on EVs.  There are generous supports available for such vehicles at the moment, both expenditure and taxation.  As the technology advances and the cost of an electric vehicle becomes competitive with that of a fossil fuel vehicle, it will no longer be appropriate to reward early adopters.  Instead, the role of Government will be to ensure that the regulatory environment supports EV drivers, ensuring that there is a sufficient supply of charging points available for example and there is competition in the supply of electricity through these charging.  In the interim, until there is a critical mass sufficient that the market can provide this EV infrastructure, its development will be funded by Government.<br\/><br\/>Regarding investments funded by the taxpayers, decision-makers need to reflect a realistic estimated shadow price of carbon to ensure decisions reflect the future costs of emissions and, of course, the benefits of abatement.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is contributing to this policy work with the levers at our disposal.  The mission of the Department is to serve the public interest by supporting the delivery of well-managed, well-targeted and sustainable public spending.  When it comes to climate change, this means public spending that supports the achievement of Ireland's low carbon transition in the most cost effective manner.  It means targeted expenditure while allowing market mechanisms to deliver carbon reductions in the most efficient manner.  With regard to project appraisal, we have published some significant proposed reforms to the public spending code.  In a major departure, we will now require all Government investment projects to price any future greenhouse gas emissions at the estimated cost that society will have to bear in reaching our climate targets.  In effect, this triples the cost of greenhouse gas emissions that applies today, with the price reaching &euro;32 a tonne by 2020, &euro;100 a tonne by 2030 and &euro;265 a tonne by 2050.  This responds to a criticism that has been made of the public sector code for some time, which is it is underpricing the future cost of carbon and needs to reflect a much higher price in decision-making, and we have taken steps to address that concern.  These moves will reduce the economic viability of certain projects that produce emissions and critically place a high value on projects that cut or abate emissions.  We are also lowering the discount rate that applies to Government investment appraisal from 5% to 4% and for long-term projects, this discount rate will decline over time.  These reforms mean that investment decisions must fully reflect the climate consequences.  Finally, the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service, IGEES, was created to enhance the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policymaking.  IGEES has conducted reviews of areas of climate-related expenditure and will continue to do so in the future.  This is a major task for the system in our Department and others to assemble the evidence required to inform Government of the decisions taken.  Significant work is required to consider options, how much they cost and what will be the emissions reductions from these options.  <br\/><br\/>In summary, we are supporting policies to price carbon.  We believe incentives matter and the best way of encouraging behavioural change is to place a price on the behaviour that we want to change and encourage people towards the alternatives.  Applying a trivial charge per plastic bag, for example, lowered plastic bag use by 95%.  I know in that case there was a clear significant alternative so the elasticity of demand was high in terms of the response to any price change and that is not exactly analogous or comparable to climate, depending on the type of change we are considering.  It shows, however, how price changes can affect behaviour depending on the availability of substitutes and alternatives.  On a larger scale, in the UK as recently as 2012, 40% of electricity came from coal.  This year, up to the middle of the year at least, just 6% of their electricity came from coal.  That is a significant change in fuel mix in the electricity sector.<br\/><br\/>The second action is having a shadow price for carbon for Government decisions that properly reflects the cost of emissions.  Just as prices matter to the individual, so too they matter for Government decision-makers.  We are now pricing the carbon emissions of any new Government investment at the price it will cost us to eliminate those emissions at a later date.  This raises the bar and will help to avoid investments which may lock us in to high carbon patterns of living.  Third, developing least cost options by estimating the marginal abatement cost of options and making effective climate policies will involve hard choices and trade-offs.  To enable these choices to be made, we must provide Government with the evidence that allows it to compare and contrast climate measures from across a wide variety of sectors.  This means examining the progress each measure will make towards our targets and the potential cost associated with them.  We are working with other Departments to ensure that when the Government is considering climate policy, it has the necessary information to make decisions.  Fourth, we are examining structures to ensure that we address the principal-agent problem and the Department is working through the existing climate structures established at Government level.  We need to ensure that we have the necessary structures to drive this change across Government, reflecting the scale and urgency of this challenge.<\/p><p> Our Department leads in a number of areas on climate change.  The Office of Government Procurement is actively working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to update our procurement guidelines to ensure that we can source goods, services or works within the public sector, with a reduced environmental impact.<\/p><p> Project Ireland 2040 contains a commitment to the effect that every building in the public stock will achieve an energy efficiency rating of at least B by 2030.  To realise this commitment, the OPW is working with the Department and the SEAI on a pilot scheme.  In 2012, 12 buildings, including our building on Merrion Street, underwent significant energy efficiency upgrades.  A further 50 buildings were upgraded this year and it is planned to upgrade another 40 in 2019.  The evidence from the pilot is that this will allow us to develop a programme sufficient to reach the target set out in Project Ireland 2040.  These initiatives are primarily financed by the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Ireland cannot solve this problem on its own, particularly in view of our scale and our contribution to global emissions.  However, we must show that as a developed country we are capable of making the necessary changes.<\/p><p> Overcoming the various biases that relate to our society and the other societies to which I referred earlier will require the kind of commitment that cross-party committees can deliver.  I do not believe this committee should underplay the challenges we face.  Addressing our emissions will mean short-term challenges and pain for individuals and groups but it will benefit us in the long term.  I have a concern that if we promise a society, people or individual groups that this will be easy or cheap, we will not build the kind of support necessary to deal with the difficult decisions ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I have one question on the national development plan, NDP, before I hand over to my colleagues.

As the Chairman is aware, Project Ireland 2040 brought together the NDP - the traditional capital plan for Governments - along with the national spatial planning framework that we devised.  We believe this is a very important change.  For the first time, we have a spatial plan for the country which sets out where we hope new homes will be built and where people will live in the future, along with a capital plan.  They reinforce each other so that the decision-making relating to the spatial dimensions of our planning are reflected in capital spending and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I set up this group, which in effect has the main Departments and delivery bodies that are responsible for delivering the plan.  We have met four or five times so far where we discussed the challenges relating to delivering the plan.  We have had presentations from each of the Departments and agencies setting out what they are doing and the challenges and timeframes involved.  Currently, we are focusing on issues such as those relating to value for money, construction inflation, planning and how to ensure that we can deliver on the targets set out for Government.<br\/><br\/>That is separate from specific issues relating to climate.  There are separate structures within Government in terms of climate.  Our focus is on delivering the overall plan of &euro;116 billion.  Within that, there are issues relating to climate.  There is the energy efficiency measures in terms of the retrofitting scheme.  We receive updates on that from the Department and the SEAI.  There are other investments relating to public transport, the metro, buses and other matters which fall within that remit.  The board is focused on delivering on the plan.<br\/><br\/>When it comes to all the dimensions of climate action, there is a separate committee which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, at assistant secretary level.  It is a senior officials group that is charged with co-ordination and delivery of climate action across the main Departments of Government.  They feed into each other in that progress with Project Ireland 2040 has an impact on our various targets.  Their view on the evolution of climate policy will have an impact on the way we deliver Project Ireland 2040 in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":30,"content":"<p>How does the Department prioritise expenditure relating to climate action?

It is fair to say that a good deal of work needs to be done to establish across the system the initiative that will give the greatest bang for our buck, which will reduce emissions and at what cost?  A good deal of work needs to be done within individual Departments.  For example, within the retrofitting space, what types of initiatives will move us forward in terms of improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock?  It is not a straightforward issue.  It is a question of financing and whether households have the ability to raise the money required.  Are they motivated?  Do they see the benefit of retrofitting?

My first question is for Mr. Moran.  What is his view of the taxation system?  Does he believe there are environmental goals attached to it?  Do we have the vision to move to a low-carbon economy?  In other words, what major changes are required in current policy to ensure we can make it more proactive?  Do we have that vision in the Department and Government to work towards those issues?<\/p> <p>  Carbon will be one of the main issues we will discuss at these hearings in the coming weeks and months.  The Climate Change Advisory Council made a submission on the price of carbon per tonne.<\/p><p>It was hoped it would come in at approximately &euro;30 per tonne in the budget.  It did not change, unfortunately.  What will be the trend for carbon pricing in the next decade?  There is talk of an increase to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  Will there be a yearly increase in the price or will it occur only on the final day?  Do people believe it will increase to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030?  How do our guests envisage the gradual increases in the carbon price being made?  How will we deal with fuel poverty and meet the concerns of people of economic need who, unfortunately, require fossil fuels at present?  There are two elements to be balanced.  This will be important so we can take society with us.  I am concerned about how we can move to a low-carbon economy while offering support to those who need it.  In the context of the price of carbon increasing to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, what timeline is the Department considering with a view to having a vision to drive forward?  These are questions on which the Department needs to give us guidance.<\/p><p> Procurement is a major issue in the context of public expenditure.  It has been a major issue across all Departments for a long time.  The lowest-price principle is one we have discussed at several committees with a view to determining how to achieve the best value for money.  Where will the environmental factors come into the schedule?  The Chairman mentioned schools.  The schools we built in the past decade all had oil burners, reflecting the lowest-cost syndrome we promoted in our economy.  What will be the guidelines on this?  Renewables are more expensive on the first day but there will be a long-term benefit for everyone.  Even turning to a gas boiler rather than an oil boiler is significant.  This all falls under Government procurement.  From where will the vision come?  From where will the review and changes come?  The Chairman mentioned oil boilers being installed in schools in the past seven or eight years.  Do we lack vision in this regard?  Do we need to move to a different model of procurement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#DD01300","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Going back as far as 2008 and 2009, we have taxed motor vehicles on the basis of carbon emissions.  We introduced a carbon tax in 2010 and 2011.  We saw progression in both of these areas until approximately 2012.  The carbon tax increased from &euro;15 initially to &euro;20, but it has been flat ever since.  With regard to motor vehicles, excise duty and so on, the rates increased but they have been unchanged since 2012.  With regard to using fiscal instruments and taxation for the purpose in question, there has not been any change over time.<br\/><br\/>The speed at which the carbon price will rise over the next ten years will ultimately be a policy matter for the Government.  There are examples of where governments have set out a trajectory for a carbon tax.  In France, for example, there is to be a rise from approximately &euro;30 to &euro;85 over a period of five or six years.  The fuel poverty implications for the French are quite different because it does not affect households as much.  This is because 75% of French energy is derived from nuclear power.  It is much less fossil-fuel intense.  The reality is that if one increases the carbon tax, one generates revenue.  By generating revenue, there is revenue to recycle to mitigate some parts of the problem.  One cannot mitigate all parts but where there are fuel poverty issues one can address the points where the pressure is greatest, including through the winter fuel scheme, for example.<br\/><br\/>Some of the important work we have done is reflected in the report.  I would recommend it.  We worked jointly with the ESRI and we published the report in October.  For the first time, for any given increase in carbon tax, we can calculate the likely impact on emissions.  For a &euro;20 impact, a doubling of the carbon tax, there would be a reduction in emissions of about 4.7% in emissions.  That is very significant in light of the overall target of a 30% reduction over the next decade or so.  The Climate Change Advisory Council talks about achieving a figure three times that.  The likelihood is that it will not be linear.  We are doing some work over the next 12 months as a priority considering the multi-annual impact and how it will be phased.  Even if it is not linear, and if it is not a case of three times 4.7% but somewhere between 10% and 15%, it would be a very significant contribution to meeting the decarbonisation goals.  I view those points as important.  The work will inform how we map out the trajectory over the coming period.  Mapping out a set of steps over the next ten years will be important.  If if is not done, the chances are that if one picks off issues on an annual basis, with an annual budgetary cycle, one will not make a huge amount of progress.<br\/><br\/>On vehicle taxation, there are fairly fundamental changes happening over the next 12 months.  The emissions measurement for new vehicles is changing.  According to the EU Commission, if we move to the<font color=\"#4F4F4F\"> worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure<\/font>, on which Mr. Kenny can provide detail, a much more realistic measurement of the actual emissions from vehicles would be given.  One would see the emissions measurement going up by 20%, on average.  That will result in a significant behavioural change.  We already saw that with the changes we made in 2008.<br\/><br\/>It is a question of having a plan and marking it over time and of the recycling of revenue to the pressure points.  The interesting piece concerning the work done with the ESRI concerns a 20% increase.  Its overall impact on the economy was not that significant, it is fair to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":42,"content":"<p>It was very trivial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":43,"content":"<p>It was very trivial.<\/p> <p>  On the impact on households, the energy costs for the lowest-income households went up by about 2.9%, and by about 4.5% for the highest-income households.

It is important because it creates certainty.  It means economic agents do not lock into expensive systems right now.  It creates certainty regarding what the future price will be, which will help reduce emissions directly, but it will also signal to economic agents that it will be increasingly profitable to invest in low-carbon and zero-carbon alternatives, and that it will be profitable to invest in carbon capture, carbon storage and so forth.

We have in the public expenditure code new estimates for the future costs that will incentivise renewables and more efficient forms by comparison with those of the past.  That will send a price signal to decision makers.<\/p> <p>  The use of heating oil in schools raises an issue.  If ten years ago a school decided on a much more expensive option, based on a given view on energy costs, another committee of this House would have criticised the Secretary General in the Department of Education and Skills for allowing schools to misspend public funds.  Heat pumps and the renewable alternatives would have been much more expensive.  If, however, one has a different view on emissions and energy costs, one does not just calculate the cost of heating for the first few years but also for the next 20.  That requires the wider system, not just ours, to reflect upon the cost of each choice.<\/p><p>We might be saying that in the short run, we will have school buildings that are more expensive but will lead to more efficient use over their life cycle.  That comes down to difficult choices.  In the short run, other measures will have to be foregone in the education system to afford such buildings.  We have to face the policy decisions and choices that are raised in that context.  Our approach involves the accommodation of regulations.  All public buildings will have to adhere to the standards of the near-zero emissions directive from 1 January next.

I will begin by asking Mr. Watt about the potential for the State to be fined if it does not reach its targets by 2020 and the impact of that if it happens.  We have heard about different costs.  This is something that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is good at.  It is not about spending money.  The Department is good at planning and estimating what certain costs will be.  I hope it can identify its best guesstimate at this stage.  If we recognise that the cost is X, we have to move along from there by accepting that we have slipped in the areas of heat and transport.  We have had our own interactions with various Departments.  Perhaps some Departments are better than others at addressing the climate change element of their work.  What role does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform play in encouraging other Departments to assist it in saving the State from having to pay these fines?  I appreciate that the Department's overall role from a budgetary point of view involves making the most of loaves and fishes and identifying the projects that will give the best bang for their buck.  In the absence of such projects coming forward, can Mr. Watt give us an insight into the role played by the Department in trying to get the Government as a whole to try to move this agenda forward?<\/p> <p>  My questions for Mr. Moran relate to taxation.  He has covered the carbon tax, which is well recognised.  At the time of last year's budget, I was vocal about the one-year benefit-in-kind exemption.  The Minister indicated in his Budget Statement that it was more than likely that there would be a review, that everything would be fine on the night and that the exemption would probably be extended for two years.  That happened and was accounted for this year.  When measures like that are not sufficiently concrete at an initial stage, it does not instil confidence in the sector to invest.  People will not change from petrol or diesel vehicles to EVs unless there is certainty.  If there is one thing the officials before us know about, it is the importance of certainty.  I thought at the time that it was remiss of the Government not to nail it down clearly in the Finance Bill that this would be a five-year project.  I do not know how companies do it, but most people try to see what value their cars have after three years, or perhaps five or seven years if they are not doing a great deal of mileage.  We need to be upfront about measures that are important signals.  Does Mr. Moran have any other ideas about how we can use taxation to improve the uptake of EVs?  It has been mentioned that we now have more than 4,000 vehicles, having come from a relatively low base.  When Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party were in government, it was projected that the figure would reach 50,000.  I accept that many things have happened since then.  We are a long way short of the critical point where second-hand cars are coming on the market.  Cars need to be rolling over in the marketplace.  There is no way we could suggest that 4,000 or 5,000 vehicles make much of a difference in the marketplace.  If the witnesses have any other ideas, I would be interested to hear them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#FF00400","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.

I will address my first question on governance to Mr. Watt.  It has been good to read Mr. Watt's presentation to see how he identifies and addresses the attitudes that have led Ireland to be known as the climate laggard.  That is where we are at present.  The Oireachtas considered the best legislative approach to ensuring the Government and Civil Service gave the necessary priority to climate change and so enacted the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  However, the legislation has not put us on the path of transition in line with the national transition objective and the Taoiseach has acknowledged this.  NGOs have said that we are second worst in Europe and the Climate Change Advisory Council states we are going completely in the wrong direction and the State is facing legal action because we are not meeting our obligations.  Some 97% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly recommended that there would be some kind of governance body set up and that we would look at specific functions, including the setting of a body of five year targets and a function of pursuing the State in legal proceedings to ensure legal obligations would be met.  In the course of his opening address Mr. Watt referred to some of these issues and I would like him to go into more detail on governance and how he sees a governance mechanism as supporting Ireland in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The Climate Change Advisory Council has been modelled in part on the UK climate change committee and in part it was modelled on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and both of these bodies have been far more successful in getting the British Government to take advice.  Has Mr. Watt any insight as to why they are making more progress than we in Ireland are making?<\/p> <p>  On Project Ireland 2040, Mr. Watt's statement emphasises the importance of public spending that supports the achievement of Ireland's low carbon transition.  Did the Department produce an analysis of the climate impact of Project Ireland 2040 in order to enable the Government to ensure its decisions in that major plan will support the achievement of the low carbon transition?  None of us has seen an analysis and we have been told that 20% of the plan will support low carbon transition but, of course, if much of the remaining 80% of the plan is undermining transition, it will not work.  Does Mr. Watt have an analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions which will result from the implementation of project Ireland 2040?  If not, is the Department prepared to do a retrospective review so that we can see what the impact of Project 2040 will be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#GG01600","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#GG01700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":91,"content":"<p>To respond to the Senator's first point, I do not agree with the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.  I do not know if we are allowed to say that, but I do not agree with the proposal for an independent body.  That is a bit of a cop out.  It is for the Government and the Oireachtas to decide what decisions will be taken because the decisions have significant implications for society and citizens.  The notion of an independent body that will suggest that to an official such as Mr. Derek Moran or to the Minister for Finance that a carbon tax will be &euro;200 by 2030, or whatever, will not work.  These involve political decisions that have to be decided by the Oireachtas and the Government in the normal course.  This comes to the essence of public policy and politics.  I do not agree with the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.  We already have an independent body the Climate Change Advisory Council which has many good things to say, but this involves having to make difficult decisions.  Whether we can change the structures in the system to help us make difficult decisions is something we can do and it comes down to the issue of how we are organised in the system and the relationship between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the other Departments.  I mentioned the difficulty that whereas the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is responsible for the targets, it is not responsible for the levers.  How does one have proper structures in Government, Cabinet committees or the structures to ensure that the genuine responsibility is taken here?  I think it is about different options.  In my statement I set out some options about ascribing target savings to sectors that are responsible for them, for example that one says to the agricultural sector that it must deliver \"X\" and that transport needs to deliver \"Y\".  The challenge with that approach is that flat rate reductions across each sector, reflecting their contribution does not necessarily reflect the marginal cost of different options.  That might be an inefficient way of doing it and might lead to higher costs than we have to incur.  We need to look at different ways to ensure the system is galvanised to deliver on this.<\/p><p>It is within the Government and not externally that we need to look at the governance.

This reflects the fact we have an agricultural sector that takes a significant share of the non-ETS.  We have homes that are bigger than in other countries and per home they produce 58% higher emissions than other countries.  We have a spatial structure that is different from other countries where we have more reliance on private cars.  It is a function of the nature of our economy, society and emissions.  It is not because other countries are doing more; it is because it is easier for them to do more relative to us because of the particular challenges we face.  Agriculture accounts for two thirds of the non-ETS.  The herd has increased by 22% over the past three years and milk production has increased by 27%.  There are very clear decisions and consequences.  The fact that the UK or another country is doing better than us reflects the different structure we have compared to them.  It is not because they are being braver, doing more or taking more action; I have not seen this in any event but I am happy to be contradicted.  I do not necessarily believe it is because they have an independent body that is forcing their system to act in a different way.  Our performance reflects the difficult structures and emissions nature of how agriculture has evolved.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Project Ireland 2040 I stated it has not been gone through in detail with all of the options being examined.  This work must be done.  We need to go through all of the options.  Project Ireland 2040 includes spending that would have an impact on emissions.  The challenge is to ensure this spending reflects the cost of future emissions.  There will be a lot of school building and renovation of the school stock.  None of this is earmarked as related to climate but how we build schools in the future will be very important in terms of ensuring they are energy efficient and minimise the impact on emissions.  There is a lot of work to be done in all of these policy areas to ensure we take decisions that will not make the problem any worse and will reduce emissions.

I presume when it comes to heating residential buildings that the price of heat pumps will have to reduce with a combination of renewables.  It will be done through technology over the coming years if we have the right structures in place and the right pricing.  I do not know about heat pumps but certainly the price of batteries is falling quite dramatically.  If we can store all of this cheap electricity in batteries it will have a transformative effect when it comes to climate and society.  The big change will be falls in the price of batteries and the extent to which devolved electricity networks can ensure we decarbonise.  Then we will have the electrification of the heat and transport systems.  It will look very different in the coming 20 or 30 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#HH01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1542203940,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I have some questions for Mr. Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#HH01300","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to be very brief because she has gone over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#HH01400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1542203940,"counter":106,"content":"<p>It is deeply frustrating that nine years after a previous Government introduced the carbon tax we have issues including ensuring low-income households benefit rather than lose from the carbon tax and that the carbon tax is complemented.  Other policies are still being treated as conundrums to be solved or works in progress.  Two decades ago, Feasta, the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, developed its proposal for cap and share and has repeatedly brought it to the attention of policy makers ever since.  In essence, it proposes that the revenue from carbon be returned to people on an individual basis.  As low-income households use far fewer fossil fuels they would be net beneficiaries of cap and share.  In 2008, Comhar Sustainable Development Council commissioned a study on cap and share proposals.  Similar initiatives, such as cap and dividend, are prominent in policy discussions in the US.  All of this is in a situation where the carbon price needs to go well beyond the &euro;40 per tonne to which the Department referred.

We have tax credits in a number of areas throughout the system.<\/p><p>Has the idea of a tax credit for doing X, Y or Z been looked at as an incentive in that regard?  There has been a lot of talk in different areas of late about low-cost loans.  The cost of refurbishing a house to bring it up to whatever standard is required is going to cost a lot of money.  If an analysis on the figures was done, it might cost &euro;50 billion over a period of time to bring the entire housing stock in the country up to a standard that would be required to be carbon-efficient, which is a lot of money.  The State is never going to be in a position to do this for everybody.  We have had low-cost loans from a Brexit point of view and in different sectors in recent times.  Has that been looked at?<\/p><p> In general, there must be more carrot than stick in the whole debate.  That has to be the whole selling point.  The communications strategy in both Departments is crucial.  In terms of selling the message of what is coming down the line, the consequences and implications of it and what it is going to cost - Mr. Watt referenced earlier the costs, differences and so on - this has to be done in a language that everybody understands.  If we do not do that, we are losing the battle straight away.  It would seem that most of the time, we are playing catch-up and it is a fire-fighting process.

If one thinks about the retrofitting challenge for a moment, one needs a combination of policies.  On average it costs about &euro;1,000 per year to heat a home with gas.  With larger homes, the cost is obviously greater.  In terms of retrofitting, heat pumps cost &euro;8,000 to &euro;9,000.  Significant retrofitting can cost &euro;10,000, &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000, which can be significant.  There is a variety of different elements.  One has to have the incentive.  If it is more expensive, ultimately, people will look over time about making savings.  If there is an incentive, they will not have to endure the hassle.  Can they access the finance?  There might be an issue then for low-cost loans.  Who is subsidising the loans?  Ultimately, we are talking about the State doing this, which is a cost to the generality of taxpayers.<\/p> <p>  There are distributional issues as well.  If one is talking about providing subsidies for better off households to insulate larger homes, that has a negative redistribution effect since the rest of are paying for higher income groups.  There has been a lot of work done in the UK on why people do not retrofit.  When it comes to attics, for example, this work suggests that the major challenge is people could not be bothered cleaning out their attics.  They decided to give grants to declutter attics.  This is what the nudge unit came up with.  Rather than giving very elaborate grants to retrofit, they gave a grant for someone to declutter one's attic, which was much more effective.  There are a variety of different instruments here, including nudges, regulations, taxes and financing instruments.  The State, as the Deputy said, through general taxation or Exchequer funding cannot do this job.  It is just not possible.  It is too expensive and it would also be wrong from a distributional aspect to try to do so.<\/p> <p>  On a communications strategy, if any society is going to engage in this type of enormous change, it requires a wider political consensus, which has other implications which are not my business.  I do not think it makes sense to think about a particular part of a State talking about a communications strategy because the changes that are required are so enormous that there has to be consensus among political groupings and other civic society groupings, like trades unions, about how we do this.  This change can take place incrementally without that wider support.<\/p> <p>  On winners and losers, we do not know all of the policy instruments.

The sectors that drive Irish exports, including the high-technology multinational sector, would not be affected greatly.  As such, the overall competitiveness of the economy is unaffected.  To come back to the Deputy's earlier point and something Mr. Watt was discussing, the ESRI looks at the impact on not only the productive sectors of the economy but on households in the ten different deciles from poorest to second poorest and on to the richest.

I heard the officials mention the Citizens' Assembly recommendation and their views on whether there should be a separate body.  Does the Department have a view on the type of leadership required?

Having a Department responsible for climate action is important but I would be interested to hear from the political side what the view is.  It is a good change to bring together within one Department.  Of course, that Department does not have responsibility for agriculture, transport, housing stock and other issues we are talking about.  It is about a combination of making that work effectively.  There are different options in the UK, including centrally-mandated targets from the Prime Minister's office.  Other countries have that too.  There might be a combination of a climate Department plus more centrally-mandated targets from central Government.  The UK allocates sectoral targets to different sectors and Ministers and their departments are responsible for delivering them.  There is merit in looking at all of those options and we have an open mind in doing so.  While I do not know what the best approach is, we have an open mind about the structures we have and need to be honest about whether they are working and whether they can deliver on a challenge of this scale.  Ultimately, it is a political question of the interaction between Departments.  That is a matter for the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>  I have already spoken about the appraisal.  We published the revised appraisal of public expenditure setting out the revised price of carbon, increasing that price into the future compared to where we are.  That will feed into the final issue raised on assessing priorities and strategic investments.  An appropriate carbon price will ensure Departments face the right incentives and costs when they evaluate a variety of potential projects.  A lot of work has to be done to look at the best options for the future.  A more realistic price of carbon will help us get to the right decisions.  The two questions are interlinked.

I remind everybody that we are talking about climate change.  Has the Department studied the recent IPCC report?  This conversation does nothing to deal with the urgency of the situation we are facing.  That report warned us that within the next dozen years or so, we are in danger of overheating the planet to a degree where we will put species and human life in danger.  We have done enough damage.  My first question is on the carbon tax because Mr. Moran said that the ESRI study demonstrates that even if we double the tax to &euro;40 per tonne, it would only result in a 5% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, which, while welcome, goes nowhere near dealing with the challenges we face.<\/p> <p>  Later he said that he does not agree with the Citizens' Assembly's recommendation regarding an independent body.  Yet there is a joke around this building that this is the committee on climate inaction.  That is often said to me.  This committee is getting that name because the Government's inaction on dealing with climate change is apparent.  If I was Mr. Watt in his Department, I would seriously examine what I do to double or treble public transport provision to get cars off the road and to end that culture that he talked about of us driving everywhere and to get rid of the idea that fuel poverty is acceptable.  MABS conducted a study recently on the constituency I live in, and one quarter of households live in fuel poverty.  They spend more money trying to keep themselves warm than they do on food.  In doing so, they are burning more gas and coal.  These are the issues that his Department should be tackling.

They are not doing enough to address the urgency of the situation and we have to start tackling climate change in a different way.  Mr. Watt quoted the Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change, which states, \"Climate change is the greatest market failure the world has ever seen\".  Yet at no stage does his briefing document move outside the parameters of the free market and market mechanisms.  He referred to cost abatement, carbon pricing, market discovery but presents no idea about how to tackle this except within the parameters of the market that has failed us, in the first instance.  The fact that their submissions arrived late made it difficult for me and my staff to challenge them in a more comprehensive way.

I thank the witnesses for their time and for the documents they provided for us.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt stated that we should not underplay the challenges that we face.  We require changes to society on a scale not seen since the Industrial Revolution.  We need buy-in across all sectors - political, departmental and throughout the country.  The committee has previously raised concerns that there is a patchwork approach to climate actions across many groups and bodies working away in their area.  A more unified and co-operative approach is obviously required to deal with these issues.  Is this an issue that the Departments are looking at and have they looked at examples from other states that are meeting their climate change targets to see what improvements we could make?<\/p> <p>  We had the ESRI in here at previous meetings.  They informed us that 88% of houses were constructed before energy efficiency measures were put in place.  We spent a lot of time teasing out the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, better energy home grants and we learned from the statistics provided that the cavity insulation grant is the most popular grant, followed by the grants for the boiler, the heating control and finally solar panels.  Dealing with constituents week on week, I put that down to the cost associated with solar panels or heating controls whereas most people can make up the difference when it comes to cavity insulation, or even if they have to change their boiler.  The other heating measures are a step too far for many people.  I ask the witnesses to discuss that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#MM03200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542203940,"counter":181,"content":"<p>We have discussed some of these issues already so I apologise if I go over old ground again.<\/p> <p>  On insulation, there is a big question over whether people have the right incentives to insulate.  There is also a lot of hassle involved in doing it and then there is the financial issue.  A household might think it has a strong incentive to retrofit but it might not have access to the financing.  SEAI could play a role there and we mentioned the potential for low cost loans earlier.  The incentives, the hassle factor and the funding are different issues which might prevent people from insulating.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it is an enormous challenge and it will take a generation to retrofit homes.  It is interesting to see the different types of options that people go with.  I know that SEAI is doing a lot of work to try to figure out what is working and what is not, why is there a variability in take-up among different income groups and what is causing that.  There is much work to be done there which will feed into policy in the future.<\/p> <p>  On climate change, we set out that there are governance challenges and a principal agent problem that we face and that other countries face.  The problem is that the Minister is responsible for delivering the targets but the levers are with a whole variety of other Departments and agencies.  Trying to have that co-ordinated approach is the job of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but there is an issue over which mechanism that should happen through.  There is a Cabinet committee on climate change and there is a senior officials' group but are they operating to the best of their capabilities and there is the question of whether it could be done differently.  We have an open mind on that.  I mentioned in my remarks that some countries have mandated targets.  For example, sector X would be mandated to deliver on a certain target and that would then be driven from the centre.  This is something that we must look at and there are certainly ways that we can improve the co-ordination challenge that exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018111400002#MM03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1542203940,"counter":182,"content":"<p>On Wednesdays we flit in and out of committee meetings so I apologise if I repeat anything that was said or asked previously.<\/p> <p>  This is all about behavioural change and one of the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations sought the establishment of an independent oversight body.

We need that level of ambition and heroic endeavour here so that by 30 November - in advance of Christmas because it is not that far away - we can look at some of the options.  Could we commit to that?<\/p> <p>  We know from the modelling that has been done that the national development plan does not close the gap.  Much of what it does takes us in the wrong direction or does not take us far enough.  I will provide a number of examples.  We have heard here about the importance of retrofitting.  It is a brilliant investment.  It is the lowest cost abatement curve.  I can say that in advance.  There is an endless number of reports that I could wheel out to show that retrofitting of energy efficiency buildings is the lowest cost carbon.  We have &euro;4 billion in the budget for that.  Andrew McDowell, the head of the EIB, was in Dublin last week and stated that we need a budget of &euro;50 billion.  John FitzGerald stated that for social housing alone we need a budget of &euro;5 billion.  The OPW has stated that we are nowhere near meeting our energy efficiency targets in respect of public buildings.

Mr. Watt correctly stated that the big problem is the sprawl model.  The national planning framework said the right thing, which is that we were going to move away from it.  The national development plan forgot that and threw it out.  The only thing we are building this year is roads.  We have no public transport projects in train.  There is not a single cycling project under construction.  It is the same again next year.  That has to change.

There are significant investments planned in BusConnects, the cycleways and the metro.  As the Deputy knows, in Dublin it is about the future planning of the city.  We have a model of development of unplanned urban sprawl which is not sustainable.  It is not sustainable from a congestion or climate perspective.  That needs to change.  A significant development in recent months is the Land Development Agency whereby the Government sets out its plans to enable much more compact development.  A key part of Project Ireland 2040 is that there is alignment between a spatial view, which is a land view, of the country and the capital plan.  They are aligned.  We can do more and we will see as the plan is being implemented how we can support the objectives of having a much more compact city.<\/p> <p>  On retrofitting, the plan sets out a significant investment programme, which is a start.  It is on its way.  We will see.  Nobody would underestimate or downplay the enormous challenge we have in retrofitting because 88% of our houses were built before we had the energy rating system in place.  We have significant challenges.  We have discussed the costs already today of different insulations and options.  We will fund it through a mix of tax incentives, tax increases to incentivise people to take the retrofitting, direct Exchequer grants, loan guarantees, low-cost funding and a variety of different options.

I note that the national development plan has a &euro;116 billion programme underpinning that.  There is &euro;7.6  million Exchequer and &euro;14.2 billion non-Exchequer funding.

Is it possible within the rules of the Department and European Union for that or part of that to be used to help assist with that transition?

I am accompanied by my fellow Irish members of the delegation, including Ms Freehill, Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Murray, Ms Forde and Mr. Lundy.  We have apologies from Mr. Hughie McGrath, Mr. Enda Stenson and Ms Kate Feeney, who could not be with us today.  I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Jim Conway, director of the eastern and midlands assembly; Ms Sarah Holden, the national co-ordinator for the delegation; and Dr. Michael Brennan, our EU affairs officer.  Without their support we could not work effectively as a unit.<\/p> <p>  I will share the opening statement with two of my colleagues.  I will provide an overview of the current mandate of the Committee of the Regions, the work that has been undertaken by the Irish delegation and the priority issues for our regions.  My colleagues, Mr. McCarthy and Ms Freehill, will then speak about two of the current priorities for the Committee of the Regions and their relevance for Ireland, the future of regional policy and funding in the post-2020 period and the findings of the Report of the Task Force on Subsidiarity, Proportionality and \"Doing Less More Efficiently\".<\/p> <p>  At the outset of its current mandate the Committee of the Regions identified five political priorities to guide its work.  These priorities include recovery following the financial crisis and ensuring that growth is spread evenly across regions and developing trust in the EU at the local level and in supporting a dialogue between the European institutions, citizens and local and regional authorities.  Events of the past four years, including the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union, the rise of populism, and the continuing concern regarding the lag in public investment illustrate that these priorities remain very relevant today.  Irish regions share the same concerns as our European neighbours, whether it is access to broadband, support for new businesses and small and medium enterprises or the question of how regions can retain young people and develop sustainable communities, whether in busy urban areas or in rural and peripheral regions.  However, with these challenges come opportunities to develop new responses and better ways of working.  In seeking to engage local communicates in the debate around the future of Europe, the Committee of the Regions has organised more than 180 citizens' debates at the local and regional level.  The delegation was proud to support one of the first of these debates in Cork in 2016 and members of the delegation have since taken part in similar local discussions with Committee of the Regions colleagues in France, Lithuania and Germany.  I am due in Germany again before the end of this month.  One common message that has emerged repeatedly is the need to improve our communication about the work and the opportunities of the EU but also how the EU and member states can better include the local and regional level in the policymaking process.  Ms Freehill will touch on that also in her intervention.<\/p> <p>  Currently, the Committee of the Regions agenda is focused on the proposals for the multi-annual financial framework and in articulating the needs of regions for the next financial period of 2021 to 2027.  The Committee of the Regions is working with regions from across Europe, including our own regional assemblies, in demanding that Cohesion Fund policy, including the European Regional Development Fund, is stronger, visible and available to every region in the EU in the next funding period.  I recently had the pleasure to serve on the jury for the European broadband awards, which will be presented later this month.  In assessing the applications, it was clear that in many cases EU regional funding and support was a key driver in increasing access to broadband in rural and peripheral regions and it is important that this support remains available.  In Ireland, we now have a unique opportunity to consider how this support at the European level can also be aligned with the development of the regional, spatial and economic strategies.<\/p> <p>  All this future planning must be seen against the background of UK decision to leave the EU and its possible impact.  Within the Committee of the Regions, the Irish delegation has been vocal on the challenges this poses for our local communities and the need to ensure that adequate planning and support measures are in place.  As the committee saw itself with the visit of the Committee of the Regions conference of presidents, it is recognised that our regions will face the biggest impact outside of the UK.  The delegation continues to work with other Irish representatives in Brussels to present a co-ordinated position and to emphasise the difficulties that Brexit poses at the local level and the need to ensure that co-operation with Northern Ireland and UK regions continues in the future.<\/p> <p>  As members may be aware, the Committee of the Regions mainly presents its views as detailed written opinions in response to legislative and other proposals from the European Commission or from requests from the Council and Parliament.  To date, Irish delegation members have completed seven opinions, with an eighth by my colleague, Ms Forde, scheduled for adoption in December.<\/p><p>In line with the priorities outlined above, our members have focused on issues of interest for Ireland&rsquo;s regional development and our local communities.  Councillor Enda Stenson&rsquo;s work on the smart villages initiative promotes the opportunities for creating sustainable and digitally connected rural communities.  Councillor Jerry Lundy&rsquo;s opinion on the action plan for a maritime strategy in the Atlantic area focuses on how we can best support our maritime communities to maximise the opportunities of the blue economy.  Councillor McCarthy has concentrated on the potential of both the digital agenda and the urban agenda to support the development of our towns and cities, while Councillor Forde&rsquo;s opinion on the proposed single market programme considers how the EU can best support our SMEs in the future.  My own opinion has considered the impact of the EU&rsquo;s competition policy on our regions.  Of course, I cannot forget our first opinion of this mandate on trade policy, which was completed by Senator Richmond, the then-head of the Irish delegation.  My delegation colleagues will be happy to speak on any of these topics in more detail as part of our general discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542204000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>As Councillor Murphy has noted, we as a delegation and as members of our regional assemblies - I am a member of the southern regional assembly - are fully supportive of the Committee of the Regions's campaign to ensure that regional development funding remains available to all regions in the EU.  I will focus particularly on the proposals for the future of European territorial co-operation, ETC, better known as INTERREG.  As a key support for European regional development, INTERREG continues to open vast possibilities to forge beneficial links across Europe and allows the free flow of knowledge and experience between regions and cities to the profit of all.  For the current funding period INTERREG has been allocated &euro;10.1 billion, distributed across all 28 member states and several non-EU countries.  Ireland is involved in nine co-operation programmes, three transnational programmes, three cross-border programmes and two co-operation programmes.   INTERREG programmes have directed hundreds of millions of euro to Ireland.  In the current period ETC funding has reached approximately &euro;169 million, which is an enormous amount of money.  Funds are applied to a huge range of areas, including innovation, entrepreneurship, environment, education, skills, urban regeneration, cultural heritage and rural development.  Significantly, INTERREG funds are available to all types of stakeholders, from city councils to community groups, and is one of the most accessible EU funding streams.<\/p> <p>  The Irish regions have had a key role in terms of INTERREG.  Our regional assemblies are contact points, advising on application for ETC funds, and assessing project proposals to ensure high project standards.  Additionally, the regional assemblies facilitate access to ETC funds by aligning their regional spatial and economic strategies, RSES, which align to the broader national planning framework which has progressed through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann over the last few months.  <\/p> <p>  The uncertainty around future UK participation in INTERREG threatens to undermine the current range of programmes in which Irish regions and local authorities are involved.  This is a major concern as we look to the post-2020 period.  We know that it is proposed that PEACE, the Northern Ireland reconciliation programme, will continue as PEACE+, expanding its remit to incorporate some of the Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland programme.  Beyond this, the questions around the future programmes are more concerning.  We do not yet know what impact Brexit will have in our regions.  We appreciate the support of the various committees we are involved with in seeking to ensure that Irish regions and local authorities continue to have access to programmes that relate to our geographic and economic priorities.  <\/p> <p>  More broadly, post-Brexit it is imperative that funding be made available so that all county councils and local authorities can recruit and expand EU funding teams.  There should be an EU funding officer in every local authority.  We have heritage officers and arts officers, so there should be an EU funding officer.  It will also be even more important to maximise the potential of the Committee of the Regions, in terms of the opinion documents it produces, to access best practice solutions and increase awareness of the Irish Regions in Europe. <\/p> <p>  Councillor Freehill will now speak about the outcomes of the recent task force report on subsidiarity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542204000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The recent Task Force Report on Subsidiarity, Proportionality and \"Doing Less More Efficiently\" emerged as part of the debate around the future of Europe.  One of the three questions posed by President Juncker at the outset of the workforce&rsquo;s work was to consider the involvement of local and regional authorities in the preparation and follow up of Union policies.  Councillors Murphy and McCarthy have mentioned the importance of communication, both in communicating the opportunities of the EU but also in ensuring that there is a mechanism to feed back the perspectives of local communities via the local and regional authorities.  This is a key message emerging from the report, in terms of the development and preparation of legislation and in assessing the impact of this legislation at the local level.  This is not just a challenge for the EU institutions, but also at the national level in member states.  Surveys of the Irish population show a high level of positivity towards the European Union, but this is not something that should be taken for granted.  Ireland&rsquo;s role within the EU will also continue to develop and change as we face into a new budget period as a net contributor, and in a European Union without the UK as a member.<\/p> <p>  At the local level we are aware of how certain legislative measures can prove contentious.  In this context, the report&rsquo;s recommendation that the European co-legislators host hearings with local and regional authorities as part of the legislative process is to be welcomed.  Similarly, the delegation welcomes the aim of improving the flow of feedback and viewpoints from local and regional authorities through public consultation questionnaires, and the role that the Committee of the Regions can play in supporting this.  The report is sensitive to the fact that different governance structures exist across the member states.  It is important to focus on what is possible within our own local regional government structures in Ireland.  As such, I would like to draw the attention of the committee to the report&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to the European semester and the need for both the European Commission and the member states to engage meaningfully with local and regional authorities in this process.  At present the delegation is consulted in the preparation of the national reform programme, but we would argue that there is considerable scope to intensify this engagement.  As mentioned previously, the three regional assemblies are currently developing their regional spatial and economic strategies.  These strategies will provide the link between our national planning framework and county-level planning.  Members of the committee will be aware, and recent EUROSTAT research confirms, that disparities continue to exist at the regional level in Ireland.  This regional structure provides a new opportunity for Ireland to more actively involve our regional and local authorities in the preparation of the national reform programmes.  Such engagement would also present an opportunity to increase awareness around the importance of the European semester process more widely throughout the country.  Our attendance here today is a positive example of how we can share information and experience, and the delegation hopes that we can continue to build on this in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Freehill"},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank Councillors Murphy, McCarthy and Freehill for their opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#C00100","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome the delegation back to Leinster House.  I appreciate the three councillors' contributions on a series of key areas.<\/p> <p>  Given the day it is, I wish to pick up on a topic Councillor McCarthy raised.  Almost all of the delegates are members of the Brexit interregional group in the Committee of the Regions, which doubtless has a vital role to play.  I appreciate from experience the strong relationship between members of the Committee of the Regions from Northern Ireland and the delegation from Ireland.  It is a powerful relationship, especially as the two who tend to attend the most are from unionist communities.  <\/p> <p>  Regardless of what happens today or whatever deal happens, we must look towards the future and see the potential for the Committee of the Regions to push the agenda of furthering Ireland's ties with the rest of Europe.  It will become increasingly important, and we have seen this in areas such as logistics, where we are opening up new shipping lanes to Santander, Rotterdam, Zeebrugge and Duisburg, as well as energy connectivity with the Celtic interconnector between France and Cork.  <\/p> <p>  We must consider the issue on a local and regional level.  Once upon a time on county councils, we talked about twinning but during the austerity years, that developed a bad reputation.  It is important, however, and it has potential.  There were many historical reasons for my old local authority being twinned with Holyhead and Cherbourg in France, which made sense when a ferry used to depart from D&uacute;n Laoghaire but it does not do so anymore.  There is no active twinning in progress with any other EU member states despite the fact that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is not only an historic area but also a major commercial hub for the Sandyford business district as well as Dundrum Town Centre.  How can the Committee of the Regions best encourage local authorities in Ireland to engage with the other 26 member states to develop new twinning associations for our towns and our counties, as well as a regional link?  Some of the relationships we have with American cities and so on make a great deal of sense, but much more needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  Councillor Murphy described the travelling he has done, and I know it is the same for every one of the nine full members and nine alternate members.  Twinning is important and full of potential.  Europe is so much closer than we think.  If we take Horizon 2020 and ERASMUS Plus as examples, the deep roots of future relationships between our third level institutions and our civic society with European partners can, and will, come from our local authorities.  It will not come from central government or the agencies such as L&eacute;argas which implement these programmes.  Rather, it must come from the European officers that Councillor McCarthy mentioned.  I hope that the local authorities in turn put resources behind the European engagement officers at a local authority level.  I am not just saying that somebody should be designated as a European engagement officer even though he or she has 17 million other jobs to be doing.  <\/p> <p>  There is great potential in this regard.  Will the delegates tease it out for the committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#C00200","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I extend a warm welcome to our colleagues on the Committee of the Regions and thank them for their work.  As this meeting is being live-streamed and they can obtain copies of their contributions to the meeting, it is a great opportunity for them to show what they are doing in Europe.  As they will know, it is hard to get that message across in the media.  So many things are happening that it is hard for the media to concentrate on the councillors' work as well as other issues.<\/p> <p>  We are in a vacuum of sorts today because it is an historic day.  As we speak, the British Cabinet is meeting at 10 Downing Street, and its decision is vital to the Brexit discussions.  I am optimistic that the cabinet will agree to these terms, which are good from the United Kingdom's point of view.  What is good for the UK will be good for us too, and it is vital the UK gets a good deal.  All of our diplomats and the Government are working hard, and there is a total united approach to the talks in Ireland, or at least in the Republic of Ireland.  The Government has the full support of all the Opposition parties, Independents and everyone else that we get the best deal.  We are singing from the one hymn sheet and we have the green jersey on.  Given their work in Europe, the councillors will recognise the diplomatic support that represents Ireland.  The top diplomats, from the ambassador to all his staff in Brussels, have worked closely with Mr. Michel Barnier to get the best deal.  I am conscious of that and we are fortunate to have that type of relationship.  <\/p> <p>  From the point of view of the Committee of the Regions, there will be a change from the end of March one way or another, when the UK leaves the European Union.  There is no likelihood of another referendum.  We in the committee have travelled extensively, for example with the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, and the signs suggest that the UK will try to make the best of its current situation, which the people decided.  Going back would be fraught with danger and I do not see it happening.  The next step will be the British Government putting it to the parliament.  The Taoiseach announced earlier that the D&aacute;il will also have a say on the final agreement, but it will be guided by the recommendations of the diplomats and the Government.<\/p> <p>  When these negotiations are completed, it is important that we have direct access to the land bridge through the United Kingdom into mainland Europe because it is the fastest way to mainland Europe, aside from direct links.  The use of the tunnel and land bridge is the quickest way to get our product onto the markets in Europe.  I have been involved with the National College of Ireland to devise technologies that could allow for a seamless transfer of goods from the Republic through Britain without obstruction.  We are working on it and we are meeting the Customs and Excise tomorrow to put forward a proposal.  I am sure other people are also working on it, and the more people who work on these solutions, the better.  There are technological solutions, through knowing what goods are on the trucks going through the land bridge, and they will prevent delays.  It cannot be that fresh meat from Kepak in Athleague will be held up in Dover before it is sent abroad.  Much work, therefore, needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  The councillors' work will now intensify to a degree.  The committee has a particular interest in Northern Ireland because it is in Europe to represent Northern Ireland's views.  There will be no representatives from Northern Ireland because its equivalent committee will be gone, as will its MEPs.  The work of the Committee of the Regions based in the Republic, therefore, will be extended.  I hope its activities in Europe will be fully funded for the future because of the additional responsibilities it will have.<\/p> <p>  Councillor Murphy said support is forthcoming for regional funding for broadband in rural areas.  Will he elaborate briefly on that?  A report on the ongoing negotiations for the extension of broadband in rural areas is anticipated.  The best people to carry out the extension are the ESB and, possibly, Eir and Bord na M&oacute;na.  State agencies are required.  I greatly regret that Eircom was sold to the private sector, and we have never needed it more than we do now, but that is life.  If I was in a position of power, I would buy the company back and take over its infrastructure.  In the long term, it would be the best approach because it has the infrastructure to provide broadband in rural areas, as does the ESB.  Technology has improved.  Previously, one could not put broadband wiring on the ESB lines but circumstances have changed slightly in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending.  We have had regular meetings with the Committee of the Regions and I hope they will continue to take place more often in the discussions that will follow the outcome of the Brexit discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#C00300","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Mattie McGrath, who was chairing another meeting.

There is much to learn from Europe.  As councillors, we have been put in a position where we have had to learn about European policy.  We have been projected, as it were, from the ground to the top.  We are trying to develop a bottom-up process in that it cannot all be top-down thinking from the European Commissioners.  Many opportunities come to mind.  I mentioned only an EU funding officer and INTERREG.<\/p> <p> I and many of the members of the delegation represent the Committee of the Regions.  We deputise for the Committee of the Regions in cities and regions across Europe.  Suddenly, we have to put on an EU hat but I cannot put on a Cork City Council hat.  I am a member of the e-government steering board, which is engaged in developing a smart Europe, smart cities and digital devices.  We are also examining broadband issues and cities also require the necessary infrastructure and g-technology.  Apart from INTERREG, we have Horizon 2020, and Ireland has one of the most successful rates of acquiring Horizon 2020 funding in the EU.  The success rate is of the order of 6% and Ireland is well ahead in that respect.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in the European entrepreneurial region award I know the people from Tralee, from the Chairman's neck of the words, were involved in developing the INTERREG programme.  They were very successful and were part of the secretariat driving the INTERREG programme.  <\/p> <p>  I am also involved in the EU urban agenda in respect of which I am involved in overseeing 12 actions plan.  They are trying to develop action plans covering everything from employment action plans to housing action plans.  Recently, I brought a delegation from my city council to the European Parliament.  We met representatives of the European Investment Bank, EIB, and they outlined what they could and could not do for our council.  I am aware that certain bodies in my city have drawn down funding from the EIB because of our interaction with the EIB, and that also applies to other cities, including Limerick.  We are involved in the new skills agenda, which is discussed in other committees of these Houses.  In terms of the European capital programme, I am a member of the jury on the European volunteering capital.  There are also the areas of sports and youth.  Galway will be the European Capital of Culture in two years time.  There is also the European capital of innovation award.  It involves more than merely twinning.  There are many opportunities into which we are deeply diving.  The opinions in this context are major toolkits for how we can advance our cities and regions.  From a rural development perspective, we are championing the Cork 2.0 Declaration 2016: A Better Life in Rural Areas.  We try to make sure that our rural regions are looked after.  We are not only examining one or two elements but are deep diving into 14 or 15 elements at any one time and trying to get the best out of that.  We are doing a good job but we need more support to get the message across that all these opportunities are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542204000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Leyden and Richmond for their interventions.  I commend Senator Richmond on the excellent work he is doing as chair of the Oireachtas Brexit committee.  I also commend this committee on its work, which has been part of a co-ordinated approach taken particularly in terms of the first phase, which involved creating an awareness throughout the EU 27 of the unique challenges Ireland faces.  That co-ordinated approach was taken by the Heads of State, this committee, our members of the European Parliament, MEPs, our national Government, and by us as members of the Committee of the Regions at sub-national level.  It is important to highlight the incredible work being done by our permanent representation in Brussels in keeping us all very well briefed.  I assure this committee that, as members of the Committee of the Regions, we are very active within our political groups, commissions and the wider committee.  We have adopted a number of resolutions and, thanks to the members of the Irish delegation, the Irish concerns around protecting the Good Friday Agreement in terms of the challenges we face from a trade perspective, given the level of trade intensity many of our regions have with the UK, are at the front and centre of those resolutions.<\/p> <p> As the committee will know, I was here for the Conference of Presidents in May of this year.  As a delegation, we have engaged directly with Michel Barnier.  We have been very active in creating such awareness.  We have moved beyond that now and the focus is on finding solutions, notwithstanding the fluid nature of where we are at currently in terms of developments in the past 24 hours.  As members of the Committee of the Regions, we have brought our knowledge back to our local authorities.  We have introduced debate within our county councils around Brexit and not only by way of notice of motions around the normal day to day challenges we face at local level in terms of investment, roads and water services.  We have brought the debate on Brexit into the chambers of our local authorities and they have reacted.  I am aware Tipperary County Council is very active in having Brexit seminars and working closely with the local enterprise offices.  I highlighted on the last occasion I was here the key role our local enterprise offices have to play and the supports national Government has provided them with.  It is extremely important that as many businesses and small and medium enterprises, SMEs, as possible are aware of and use those supports to improve their competitiveness, finance, attendance at trade shows and online presence because that is as much as we can do at present.  I had a Brexit dialogue in Clonmel in the past two months.  It was organised in collaboration with the local chamber of commerce and attended by 300 representatives from business and the agri sector.  We are very active in bringing that debate at European level back into the chambers of our local authorities.  At the Committee of the Regions level, we prepared a territorial impact assessment, which very much mirrored the Copenhagen Economics report commissioned by our Government.  Irish regions will be the those most impacted by Brexit as well as our agrifood machinery, wholesale, medical device and pharma sectors.  A great deal of good work is being done.  Currently, it is about creating that awareness and highlighting the important role our local enterprise offices have to play.<\/p> <p>  A good question was asked about broadband.  There has been much talk of it and everybody in this room is well aware of high-speed sustainable broadband being a driver of economic growth in rural and peripheral regions and an enabler of distance working, with people being able to work at home rather than commuting to our large urban centres.  A significant portion of ERDF moneys have been promised for the national broadband plan.  I thought the figure was &euro;75 million but my colleague has advised me it could be more than that.  There has been much delay in the implementation of the national broadband plan.  As I highlighted in an opinion on competition policy, we need greater flexibility in state aid rules when it comes to the roll-out of broadband.  When the national broadband plan was launched in 2012 it was very difficult to define an intervention map on the one hand and at the same time technological advances are very fluid.  We need greater flexibility in the application of State aid rules and, hopefully, that is a lesson that has been learned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the delegation and compliment them on the work they are doing in liaising with their colleagues in Europe.  The importance of that work needs to be emphasised.  It is extremely important for parliamentarians and local authority members across Europe to interact with each other in order to be up to speed on what affects them in their own place.  That gives them an opportunity to draw comparisons, and I know the members of the delegation are doing that.  Instead of isolating themselves from the rest of Europe and withdrawing into their respective corners, they have done the opposite.  The Committee of the Regions, in general, has done tremendous work in bringing to the attention of all the authorities the importance of equal participation and co-operation.<\/p><p>The benefits of remaining in the EU have been well and truly discussed here and elsewhere.  I am sure they have been discussed among the various council groups as well.  Maybe we have come to realise the importance of what we have.  Possibly we have also come to recognise the cost of achieving what we have achieved.  It did not happen overnight.  It was not simple.  It happened over many years and with substantial costs.  The Europe that is presented to us today is a far cry from the Europe of 1945, when previous experiments had gone wrong and a price had needed to be paid by millions of people.  It is no harm to reflect on that now.<\/p><p> In the context of the debate we have had over the past couple of years, it is no harm to reflect on the importance of the North of Ireland and the South of Ireland to each other.  I am not talking about the North or the South overcoming the other or subsuming the other.  I am talking about the North and the South co-operating in joint activity and trade and commerce and moving as a single unit.  As the witnesses will be aware, that has been a feature of the debate to date.  I hope that will continue to be the case.   If we are to be truly representative of the island of Ireland, those of us on this part of the island must be absolutely familiar with the concerns of our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  We must be equally committed to ensuring the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement continues in place without interruption.<\/p><p> This is a time for reflection on the degree to which we have co-operated in the past with our colleagues across the Irish Sea.  We should also bear in mind the importance of the single economic entity that exists and the common travel area.  We hope that as a result of recent discussions, the future in that area will be guaranteed.  We sincerely hope so.  I believe that even if there is a temporary hiccup, eventually wiser heads will prevail and we will reap the rewards of the foresight and thinking of those who foresaw the development of Europe from the ashes of the past, who looked into the future and who made the necessary sacrifices and commitments.<\/p><p> There are challenges all over the globe now.  I have always had a feeling that every 100 years or so, people across the globe become restive, begin to covet what others have and wonder how better they can get on at the expense of others.  These discordant notes are arising throughout Europe and throughout the world at the present time.  They are not consistent with peace, co-operation and peaceful coexistence.  On every occasion in the past when this kind of discordant activity arose, there was a huge price for everybody to pay.  We know the witnesses have been doing their part to ensure discordant and unhelpful voices are addressed, if not necessarily confronted, in a way that makes them hesitate and ponder where they might go next.  We compliment them on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#D00700","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and salute the work they are doing.

I would be interested to hear how the witnesses have noticed this in their communities.  Is it a matter with which they will individually have to deal in next year's elections?<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to villages.  We have some beautiful villages, but I often think we are generally lacking in this regard compared to villages in places like the Cotswolds and parts of France.

It is great to have a two-way flow of communication.  The importance of being able to counteract negativity in relation to the EU, even at local level, has been mentioned.  Deirdre Clune, MEP, and I had a grassroots engagement in Cork in July of this year.  Unfortunately, it was the hottest time of the year.  It is not easy to bring people to public meetings in such circumstances.  It struck me that people were delighted to be asked for their opinions on what they like and do not like about the EU.  Everyone who spoke wanted stability, which is fine.  Obviously, everyone was concerned about Brexit, justice and social cohesion.  I was able to relay that back to the EU.  As a result, I was asked to speak in Helsinki a week ago.  Those involved wanted to know what specifically we are doing in Cork and across the country about climate action, and what we need from the EU to help us.  It is very significant that we can hone in on specific issues of concern to us.  Some local authorities are starting to communicate what supports are available from the EU in this area, whereas others have a little homework to do.  That is where we come in.  We are now discussing the RACSs with the regional authority.  We can articulate that the Government and the EU are making a lot of funding available and that such supports should be disseminated through the regional assemblies down into the local authorities.  If we are not at the starting gate, we will lose out because the money will follow the policy.<\/p> <p>  In short, I think we should be having more dialogue with people because they teach us.  They learn from us and we learn from them, and barriers are broken down.  In my experience since becoming a member of the Committee of the Regions, small business people, teachers and garda&iacute; are the same in every country.  They want peace, stability and jobs.

We are working with the Committee of the Regions to address many of the issues that have already been mentioned, including broadband and Brexit.  The committee is working as an Irish team at EU level to represent our country and speak on behalf of regional assemblies and local county councils on issues that are relevant to local and regional authorities.  We give regular updates on the work we are doing.<\/p> <p>  I would like to comment on some of the issues that have been raised by Senator Leyden.  Broadband is a significant issue in rural areas.  I had the great opportunity of bringing in an opinion on the mid-term review of the Atlantic strategy, which involves creating sustainable jobs in coastal regions.  Young people in coastal regions in Ireland and throughout Europe are drifting into major urban areas.  It was discovered during the course of the research I was doing that every year, 50 million people move from rural areas to urban areas.<\/p><p>The effect is that, by 2050, the United Nations predicts that 68% of the world population will live in cities.  That is unsustainable.  Through the Committee of the Regions and my opinion which has been adopted by it, we are trying to create sustainable communities in coastal, island and outermost regions.  If, owing to the lack of broadband and good infrastructure, young people continue to drift into urban areas and cities, we will lose heritage in these coastal regions.  We will lose our folklore and possibly our language and skills and, if that happens, all of the other services that are available such as schools, football clubs and post offices will close and we will have an entire generation that will have been removed from these areas.  It is not just happening in my home area of County Sligo, it is also affecting regions in France, Spain, Portugal, Scotland and Wales.  Of course, we are going to lose the United Kingdom, one of the great maritime nations.  We will lose its skills in boat building from the European Union, which will create problems for us.  I see the problems Brexit will cause in County Sligo, a Border county from which so many cross the Border into Enniskillen to work.  People from Enniskillen come to Sligo and Manorhamilton to work and there are also cross-Border health issues.  I live in Tubbercurry which is exactly halfway between Enniskillen and Galway.  So many people are going to the new hospital in Enniskillen to access health services, which will create problems.<\/p><p> I thank members for their comments.  As an island nation, North and South, we must work together in friendship.

It is important that we have this dialogue and I thank the delegates for the work they are doing in pushing forward the Irish issues in the context of Brexit and with the people they meet in the course of their work.  I thank them for the reports they have outlined for us.  They will probably agree that the Committee of the Regions is the institution about which citizens know the least of all of the European institutions; therefore, we need to gain more recognition for the important work it does.<\/p> <p>  On the Multi-annual Financial Framework which was mentioned in the presentations, unless I am mistaken, there was no reference to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  I would have thought that the future of the CAP was extremely important for the regions and this country, in particular.

Immigration is one of the big issues facing the European Union, not so much this state but other nation states.  As a result, there is populism and the rise of the far right and so on and a decline in European liberal democratic values.  That is one of the biggest threats to the European Union at this time.

I know that all councillors and members have done huge work, but I compliment my local man in Clonmel, Councillor Murphy, on the leading role he has played and the work he does on a continuous basis in the county council on behalf of his constituents and also at the Committee of the Regions.  I compliment him on the valuable work he has done and the wonderful seminar he organised.  Councillor Forde said it had been held in Cork.  He waited until the weather was a little cooler, but there was a full house and he had the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney as a guest.  I know from the Chamber of Commerce in Clonmel that there was very positive feedback from it.  Many of us have been preaching and talking about Brexit for so long, but it was consultative engagement with the very people who would be affected, namely, business people.  They were asked how they might be affected and in what way they felt Brexit would impact on them.  I know that the seminar was very beneficial and I received excellent feedback from it, even though I was not able to attend.  It is important that we talk about this issue and take notice of the bottom up approach taken in consulting and sitting down with the Minister who was dealing with it, on a 24-hour basis at this stage.  There has been great feedback and only time will tell what will happen.  I know that these are anxious times and look forward to meeting the Taoiseach later this evening on behalf of our group for a briefing.<\/p> <p>  Councillor Murphy also mentioned the Competition Authority in the report of the Committee of the Regions.  Perhaps he might expand on what he meant when he said he felt a lot of things could change and that there could be a better appreciation of how quickly things had evolved with the Internet and social media.  Perhaps he might expand on how he thinks we are in a sticky wicket in the provision of broadband and ten to 15 years too late.  As he obviously has an insight into the matter, he might expand on his views and explain what he meant.<\/p> <p>  The Committee of the Regions has been very beneficial.

Sometimes we think we are living in isolation in rural Ireland, but, in fact, many regions throughout Europe are facing greater and bigger challenges than we are.  Entire towns and villages have emptied in Spain, France, Bulgaria, etc.  We have met people and officials from these communities and they just say it was a litany of small cuts, with police stations, post offices, banks and shops being closed.  It then comes to a tipping point which one official described as \"a run on the banks.\"  It is hard to imagine a vibrant community could die so quickly, but that is what is happening.  For example, post-2020, in the north-west region, huge tracts of rural France and Spain will be in transition.  That means that all of the statistics are indicating that all of these rural regions are not progressing and that they are moving backwards.<\/p><p>The only thing preventing the north-west region from going back to objective 1 status is the repatriated profits of some of the multinational companies, which are overinflating the gross domestic product, GDP, <i>per capita<\/i>in the region.  Without these, we would have objective 1 status again.  We have a serious crisis in rural Ireland.  As Councillor Lundy noted, the demographic is changing dramatically.  There is a major flight from the land and a low number of young farmers taking on their family homesteads and continuing the tradition of farming.  As Deputy Haughey said, the CAP is crucial in respect of all of those issues.  <br\/><br\/>The feedback from the rural regions of Europe is that tourism, the Common Agricultural Policy, the LEADER programme and various other initiatives are not sufficient to reverse the decline.  What these regions need is a front-loading of infrastructure to attract investment and employment.  Tourism, to a large degree, is the icing on the cake but only accounts for 5% of GDP in Ireland.We need to ensure policy addresses the other 95%.A problem we have encountered in meetings with officials in Brussels is that they are quite happy to front-load money into the regions but only in circumstances where the respective nation states are prepared to match it.  Unfortunately, many European states are not prepared to step up to the plate with matching funding.  Perhaps members could deal with that issue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Leyden referred to a land bridge to the United Kingdom.  In the west, half of the western rail corridor is open and the other half is closed.  This is a low carbon, tariff-free and low cost route into Waterford Port and out to the European mainland with its market of 500 million people.  The route was nominated for trans-European transport network, TEN-T, funding in 2011.  The Government took it off the agenda in 2014, despite Europe making available 50% or 60% grant aid for the initiative.  I hope that when the review of TEN-T starts in 2020, Oireachtas Members will lobby to ensure this section of the western rail corridor is put back on the agenda for TEN-T funding.  That funding is available because rail transport is regarded as a low carbon transport initiative and ties into climate change, etc.  As the UK will no longer be a common transit area post-Brexit, many multinational companies in Mayo and Galway are looking at alternative routes to the European market.  The western rail corridor, from Sligo to Waterford and Cork ports, is an obvious alternative.  However, it needs funding, which requires the State to nominate the project as part of TEN-T.  Oireachtas Members could lobby to have the project put back into the TEN-T for funding in 2020 given that 50% of the funding would come from Europe, with Ireland providing matching funding.<br\/><br\/>The other major issue is broadband.  There is a serious deficit of broadband in rural Ireland.  Councillor Murphy referred to the various state aid regulations that are impeding the roll-out of broadband.  It is hard for private utilities to embark on a major roll-out of broadband in circumstances where the economies of scale are acutely low.  We are sometimes told at briefings of the Committee of the Regions that the Luxembourg Government or other governments are actively engaged in rolling out broadband.  They do not seem to be impeded either by competition law or state aid law.  The Committee of the Regions will examine the reasons local and national governments in some countries can show such latitude in rolling out broadband fibre, whereas we are told that there is an impediment.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons, it is important that we have this engagement as it allows Members of the Oireachtas to find out what impediments we are facing in Europe.  It is also important that Members, irrespective of which party is in government, can bring pressure to bear to ensure major infrastructural projects are nominated in the regions to achieve balanced regional development.  In circumstances where there is significant matching funding from Europe, there is no excuse for the State failing to nominate major critical infrastructure in the rural regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542204000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity for regional and local government to interact with this committee.  Many questions, particularly from Deputies Haughey and Durkan, were about our experiences in respect of comparing of local and regional government in Ireland with the rest of Europe.  When I first became involved in the Committee of the Regions in the 1990s, it was an eye-opener to realise that Ireland, below the level of the Oireachtas, has the lowest level of participation in the democratic world.  The reason is that regional and local government structures are extremely weak.<\/p> <p>  To give an example, we spend about 7.5% of gross national product, GNP, at local government level.  In Scandinavia, the figure is 33%.  That demonstrates the difference.  As members of the Committee of the Regions, we are participating in opinions on areas on which local government in Ireland does not even have a competency, for example, education, policing, health, social welfare, water and major funding for local government infrastructural projects.  These areas are all under the administration of local and regional governments in the rest of Europe.  Regional assemblies in Ireland only have the power to comment and do not have power to make decisions.  To some extent, therefore, the power lies in the hands of Members of Oireachtas.  It would a pity and remiss of us to not make that point today.<\/p> <p>  The current discord in Europe was raised by a number of speakers and it is an issue that concerns all of us greatly.  Subsidiarity is, however, bottom up and top down.  The best way to keep and maintain peace is to involve citizens and make sure they know what is going on.  Citizens probably do not know all that much about what is going on in Europe because information does not permeate down to them.  There are many initiatives that could be taken to strengthen local government in Ireland.  It would make for a much better society if citizens and local government had an opportunity to be involved.  Perhaps the Seanad could play a big role in this regard in the sense that it is always open to considering opportunities.  I am well aware that Leinster House is a busy place and Members have a heavy workload and little time.  However, I am perfectly sure that the Seanad could be given the power of initiative in many areas, such as waste management, noise, estate management and so forth.  In every other country, it is the local authorities that have competencies in these areas.  Ireland is way behind with that aspect of democracy.  It would be a pity not to use today's visit to highlight that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Freehill"},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I have one quick point on the relationship between the work of the Committee of the Regions and the assemblies, of which most of the witnesses are members.

This stems from economics.  The economic experts will tell us that we can provide services for 100,000 people in a very small space, but not in a widely spread rural area.  That is not necessarily true because packing a population into too small a space has other consequence with which we unfortunately have to deal.<\/p> <p>  Professor Caulfield in Galway was a great supporter of the concept of retaining a population in rural Ireland.  Those of us who served our time as members of local authorities know that it is becoming more and more difficult to retain the population of rural Ireland because of policies at local authority level.  Again, these spring from economics.  All local authorities should play a role in that respect.  Once the population of a rural area dwindles, services go, whether schools, police stations, post offices or banks.  It is essential that we retain an upcoming young population in rural Ireland.  Modern technology, such as broadband, are required to assist in this.  They can be complementary to give to people living in rural Ireland a quality of life equal to or better than that of those living in the centre of New York.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#H00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1542204000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I ask each of the witnesses to make some final comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#H00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542204000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I will address a couple of points, specifically Senator Coghlan's comments on the rise of populism and the disconnect between the citizen and the European Union.  I try to knock on doors as often as I can and when I do so I find that citizens are always preoccupied with what they perceive as national issues, job security and infrastructural deficits, for example, in broadband or roads.  The irony is that the European Union plays such a key role in addressing those concerns.  The issue, therefore, is to convince citizens and communicate to them at every opportunity about this important role, for example, with regard to funding for broadband from the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.  I met the Commissioner on Monday and we spoke about LEADER funding.  If we had here ten organisations that had received funding from LEADER, very few of them would be aware of the origin of LEADER funding.  I am often critical of local authorities because while they are well able to hand out LEADER funding, they rarely make the link between the European Union and the LEADER programme.  It is incumbent on all of us at subnational level, particularly on us as members of the Committee of the Regions, to communicate to citizens a positive message about the role the European Union plays in addressing concerns that they perceive only national governments can address.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to competition policy, which is a bit of a hobby-horse of mine.  This comes back again to the citizen.  One of the benefits of Ireland's EU membership has been access to the Single Market.  The Directorate General for Competition has been highly effective in ensuring fair and effective competition.  When it comes to addressing the infrastructural deficit that has arisen as a consequence of the financial crisis, I am often critical.  We have a big gap to bridge in the coming years and we need greater flexibility in the application of state aid rules.  I believe there are solutions to the crisis with the national broadband plan, but they will require greater flexibility in state aid rules and by the Commission for Communications Regulation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, there is a real challenge and debate to be had on the multi-annual financial framework.  There is a challenge insofar as there will no longer be a contribution from the UK.  Other challenges are migration and security.  The Irish delegation has been consistent in calling for the maintenance and preservation of the CAP budget.  I acknowledge there has been 6% cut in CAP, but there are some good measures within CAP around greater flexibility for member states and for young farmers.  My co-ordinator has just reminded me that we are due to debate the CAP at our plenary session in December.   I assure Deputy Haughey that we will be very active in that debate and we will call for the CAP to be maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018111400002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542204000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy stole my thunder in telling the committee that we will debate CAP at the next plenary session.

Communication could be improved in promoting the Your Europe and SOLVIT portals, which any citizen can access and have a question answered immediately.  The chain between the EU and national, regional and local governments is rusty in places.  Meetings between the committee and members of the regional assemblies would be extremely beneficial in helping the committee see how the local authorities could do more.  Hitherto, the local authorities seem to only be about delivering services but we are moving into the area of economic development and we have a larger role to play in responding to citizens' needs and hosting different forums that could debate issues such as climate action and what people want from their regions.

This is enough to all the council to consider refurbishing one of our heritage assets, an Elizabethan fort.

I do not see a crisis.  In Greece and Italy I have heard personal accounts of local councillors picking refugees up from beaches and burying them with their own money and ward funding.  It is heartbreaking to hear those stories.  All the Irish delegation can do is call for funding for migrant integration.<\/p> <p>  We have healthy competition between Cork and Kerry, Cork and Dublin, Cork and Galway and Cork and Waterford, but there are some 500 cities in Atlantic Europe that are hunting for opportunities.

One of the proposals is that the polluter pays principle applied to waste and water services be applied to road freight.  Essentially, the European Union intends to tax road freight off the road onto rail.  That is why there is significant grant aid for low-carbon transport initiatives such as rail services.  The European Union is moving towards being a low-carbon economy by 2050.  We also need to make sure we will be there.  Every product we buy has a carbon footprint.  Climate change is kicking in.  It is not abstract; it is going to impact on us in the coming decades and we need to be ready to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  On populism, I note that people in this country do not even know the fundamentals of local and national government.  Civics was once taught in the classroom and people knew how government worked or did not work.  When they went into a polling booth, they could make an informed and enlightened decision.  I meet third level graduates whose lack of knowledge of the fundamentals of local and national government might appal committee members.  Last week I encountered a third level graduate who was very annoyed about a county development plan that was up for review.  His group made 300 submissions, while the opposing group sent four.  He thought it was like a game of football and that his team had won 300:4.  I could not explain to him statutory obligations under government and EU policy, etc.  That shows a lack of information, from which populism grows.  I could not convince him that it did not work that way.  There is a job of work to be done in the education system across Europe.  We are facing a very serious and significant crisis because a lot of these things are thrashed out on social media and Facebook.  Unfortunately, that is what is informing people.

On behalf of the people I represent, during the course of that engagement I outlined the effect decisions made in the European Union had on how we operated in Ireland.

I do not care who was in power or who made the decision; I would have been critical of it regardless.  I would have been critical of it if I had been part of the organisation that made it quite simply because I believe the work town councillors, city councillors and county councillors do is invaluable.  Where I come from, town councils that were abolished such as Killarney Town Council were doing invaluable work that has not been replaced.  The funny thing about the make-up of a council is that there are different people with their own life experiences and expertise.  A typical example was Killarney Town Council, in which we had councillors who were specialists in one field or another.  They used to come together at and bring that knowledge to their monthly meetings.  It was like a group of experts coming together.  They had a connection with the county council and their Oireachtas Members.  They formed different tiers of support for communities.

The gross current budget for the health sector for 2019 is &euro;16.36 billion.  This is equivalent to an increase of &euro;1.521 billion or 10.2% compared to the 2018 original allocation of &euro;14.839 billion.  I am also pleased to announce a capital budget of &euro;667 million, which is an increase of &euro;174 million on last year's capital budget.  This brings the total gross health budget for 2019 to more than &euro;17 billion.<\/p> <p>  For the immediate future, the next significant step is the agreement of the national service plan.  The service plan for 2019 will set out the type and volume of services the HSE will provide in respect of the significant budget of more than &euro;16 billion it has received for next year.  The HSE must ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources is made when planning the services to be provided in 2019.  On budget day the Minister stated we are now firmly in the era of Sl&aacute;intecare and, for the first time, 2019 will see the HSE's national service plan based and developed on the framework of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, which sets out the Government's plan for delivering a high quality, sustainable and equitable health and social care service over the next decade.  The national service plan will set out the details on how the totality of health service resources will be made to advance Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is now in discussion with the Department on developing the service plan for 2019 with the goal of delivering a plan that makes progress on meeting priority health and social care needs and clearly allows the executive to operate within its notified resources.  The Minister expects to receive a draft service plan submitted for his approval from the HSE in the coming weeks.  The focus on Sl&aacute;intecare in this process is an important element of the strategic transformation of our health service but, of course, we must also focus on the here and now and the immediate challenges we face.<\/p> <p>  As we head into a period of pressure in our health service, I acknowledge the ongoing commitment, dedication and co-operation of people working in our health services.  This is something of which the Minister and we in Ireland can be very proud.  I know that on a daily basis our doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals make personal sacrifices in the interests of putting patients first.  However, we have learned lessons from previous winter seasons.  Consideration of staff management issues is just one element of a planning process to ensure that we prepare for the winter period in the best way we can.  The Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure the most effective response to this winter within current capacity and resources.  A total of &euro;10 million in additional funding has been allocated in 2018, primarily for provision of supports to get patients home from hospital, where appropriate, before the end of the year, with a focus on supporting patients in the over-75 age group.  The core objective of this measure is to ease congestion in hospitals as far as possible before the end of the year, to prepare for the expected peak in demand in the new year.  In addition, the Minister has requested, in the context of the national service plan, that the HSE plans activity in 2019 to manage critical demand pressures, most particularly in respect of increased attendance at emergency departments.  This planning will include activity in hospitals, primary care and community care to ensure the system is working at full capacity throughout busy periods.  This request provides clarity to the HSE on the level of funding available in 2019 to meet winter pressures.<\/p> <p>  The challenges evident in hospital emergency departments are a symptom of broader challenges within the hospital itself and across the wider health service.  Increasing capacity and efficiency throughout the hospital, improving services in the community to provide care for patients outside of the emergency departments and supporting the discharge of patients home or into other community services are all part of the solution.  The national development plan provides for a major increase of 2,600 in bed capacity, as identified in the health service capacity review, and this will remain a priority in 2019.  Over the past 12 months, an additional 240 beds have been opened and a further 79 additional beds are planned for the fourth quarter of 2018 and early 2019.  Next year, a further &euro;10 million will be invested to enable additional beds to be opened to alleviate pressure on emergency departments for this winter and the years ahead, on foot of the recommendations in the health service capacity review.  The Department is in discussion with the HSE, in the context of the national service plan for 2019, to identify sites for investment and the associated number of beds, as part of an agreed capacity programme for 2019.<\/p> <p>  Increasing capacity and access go hand in hand with reducing waiting lists.  A significant investment of &euro;55 million was made in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, this year and ambitious targets were set to reduce the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure to below 70,000.  I am pleased to report that as a result of the activity of the HSE and the NTPF we are on track to meet this target, with the number of patients at the end of October at 72,000, down from a peak of just over 86,000 in July 2017.  The improvement has been delivered against a backdrop of increased demand for services and a very challenging start to the year that saw elective activity curtailed as a result of emergency department pressures and severe weather events.  Building on this progress, in budget 2019 the Government further increased investment in this area, with funding to the NTPF rising to &euro;75 million in 2019.  The NTPF plans to reduce further the number of patients waiting to below 59,000 by year end.  While significant progress has been made on inpatient and day case procedures, the number of patients waiting for their first outpatient appointment continues to be a challenge.  The Minister has asked the HSE and the NTPF to bring a renewed focus to outpatient activity in 2019.  Arising from the increased investment, the NTPF plans to arrange at least 40,000 first outpatient appointments in 2019.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, the Minister approved the establishment of a central waiting list validation function within the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Validation has many benefits, including the identification of patients on waiting lists who are ready, willing and available to proceed with hospital care, a reduction in the rate of those who do not attend and an improvement in information for managing waiting lists.  It is worth noting that each year more than 500,000 patients do not attend their appointments.  Validation has been under way for a number of years at a local level and the NTPF estimates that next year more than 30,000 patients who no longer require an outpatient appointment will come off the outpatient waiting list as a result of this activity.<\/p> <p>  I will now update members on matters related to CervicalCheck.  In September, as committee members know, Dr. Gabriel Scally provided the final report of his scoping inquiry into issues relating to CervicalCheck.  His report provided welcome reassurance about the laboratories currently contracted by CervicalCheck.<\/p><p>He is satisfied with the quality management processes in these labs.  It is very important to say that Dr. Scally confirmed that he found no reason the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new human papillomavirus, HPV, regime is introduced.<\/p><p> He also stated that continuation of screening in the coming months is of crucial importance.<\/p><p> The Government fully agrees with this as screening saves lives.  CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland.  As stated in the Scally report, the lifetime risk of a woman getting cervical cancer was one in 135 in 2015, significantly lower than the lifetime risk in 2007 of one in 96.  This represents a substantial improvement.  The Government has accepted all 50 of Dr. Scally's recommendations.  The Minister has committed to returning to Government within three months, as recommended by Dr. Scally, with a full plan for the implementation of these recommendations.<\/p><p> In June 2018, the Minister established a national cervical steering committee, that is co-chaired by the chief medical officer and the assistant secretary for acute hospitals in the Department and includes senior management of the Department, the HSE, clinicians and patient advocates.<\/p><p> It provides oversight and assurance on managing the response to the CervicalCheck issues, and ensuring the implementation of the key decisions taken by Government.  The minutes and agenda for each meeting are published on the Department&rsquo;s website, to allow for full transparency and for members of the public to be updated on the committee&rsquo;s activities.  The Minister is updated weekly, receiving updates on the progress of the steering committee and these are also published.<\/p><p> The committee has had 12 meetings to date since it was established on 21 June last.  The most recent meeting was on 8 November.  The committee will meet twice more before the end of the year.<\/p><p> Separate to the work carried out by Dr. Scally, the independent clinical expert panel review, which is being led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, is under way.  This review is examining the results of screening tests of all women who have developed cervical cancer who participated in the screening programme since it was established.<\/p><p> The review will provide independent clinical assurances to women about the timing of their diagnosis, and any issues relating to their treatment and outcome.  The Minister would also like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for its time and engagement in recent days as they discussed the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.  In addition, preparations are ongoing for the implementation of the service as soon as possible.  The Department and the HSE are at an advanced stage of drafting contractual proposals for the provision of termination of pregnancy services in the community setting.<\/p><p> In parallel with service planning and expansion, clinical guidelines for medical practitioners are in preparation by the medical colleges and the Department has provided a grant to support their development.<\/p><p> The Minister is conscious that women are continuing to travel every day to access services abroad and in some cases to order medication over the Internet.<\/p><p> He wants to stress again that it is this Government&rsquo;s priority to have a medically delivered, safe and regulated service for the termination of pregnancy for all those who require it, based on the huge mandate that the Irish people have given for this work.<\/p><p> There is also significant work being done to implement the national maternity strategy.  Ireland&rsquo;s national maternity strategy was published in 2016.  The national women and infant&rsquo;s health programme, NWIHP, has been established within the HSE and is driving the strategy&rsquo;s implementation.  A key aim of the strategy is to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place so that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  The strategy&rsquo;s three care pathways &ndash; supported, assisted and specialised &ndash; will deliver maternity care in a manner that is both appropriate and woman-centred.<\/p><p> A detailed implementation plan for the strategy was published in October 2017, providing a clear roadmap for the development of maternity services into the future and, in 2018, the Government provided additional development funding of &euro;4.55 million to progress the strategy and to improve waiting times for gynaecology services.<\/p><p> The national women and infants health programme highlighted a number of priorities which this funding has continued to address over the course of 2018.  These include the development of community midwifery teams, the development of quality and safety frameworks and the improvement of access to anomaly scanning services.  This year, 2018, has seen the continued expansion of anomaly scanning services in maternity hospitals and units across the country and the development of critical quality and safety initiatives.  The development of the supported care pathway and of community midwifery teams to deliver care in line with the recommendations of the strategy is also ongoing and a multidisciplinary steering group has been established by the NWIHP to oversee the implementation of the strategy&rsquo;s model of care.  This year has also seen the continued roll-out of the very successful maternal and newborn clinical management system, with phase 1 completed and implemented across 4 sites: Cork University Maternity Hospital, University Hospital Kerry, the Rotunda Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital.<\/p><p> Looking ahead, it is important to ensure that we build on developments to date and the Department will be engaging closely with the programme to ensure this progress continues into the coming year.<\/p><p> To conclude, planning for the weeks and months ahead now that we are in the winter period is of course the top priority.  Yes, we face challenges.  However, we now have a long-term plan for healthcare and as I have just outlined, we are making progress this year, and we will each and every year.  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to brief it on developments.  I am interested in hearing members' views and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#F00300","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today's meeting.  I am joined by my colleagues as previously introduced by the Chairman.  In preparation for the meeting, committee members requested information and replies to a number of specific questions and they will by now have received the written response to them.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks to the following issues.<\/p> <p>  First, I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, that it is intended to allocate an additional &euro;700 million to the health service in 2018 by way of Supplementary Estimate, which now brings the 2018 net revenue budget of the HSE to &euro;15.2 billion.  I know that this was the subject of the Joint Committee on Health meeting of 24 October so I will confine my remarks to welcoming the fact that this will be included in the base funding of 2019.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is currently finalising an implementation delivery plan in response to the Scally review recommendations.  This is a considerable piece of work ranging from procurement to open disclosure and from governance to risk management.  While our focus will be on early implementation, our concern will be to ensure that plans are solid and sustainable in the future.<\/p> <p>  We are continuing to support the international expert panel RCOG review, which was commissioned by the Minister for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  This work will continue through 2018 and into 2019.<\/p> <p>  A key risk to enable cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.  We have secured agreements to enable continuity of the service and are currently finalising contracts with service providers.  The new model will ultimately see a more balanced model of public and private provision in Ireland.  We are also carrying out an extensive worldwide exercise to secure additional capacity, given current demands leading to extended reporting time for women.<\/p> <p>  We are progressing plans to introduce primary HPV screening, with a focus on international best practice to ensure we have a successful deployment.  At the present moment, until we complete our planning work and finalise on current laboratory provision, we are not in a position to provide a critical path or timetable for the introduction of HPV testing.<\/p> <p>  We are continuing to provide supports to the women and their families impacted by the crisis.  We are also strengthening the role of patients in the CervicalCheck programme with the establishment of a public patient involvement panel and patient representation on key groups.<\/p> <p>  Turning to other matters , I advise the committee that planning for winter 2018-19 is well advanced in respect of planning and escalation, the operational management of patient flow and maintaining public health in place at hospital group and community healthcare organisation, CHO, level.  There are five priorities for this winter in the following broad categories: ensuring integrated working between acute hospitals and the community; ensuring robust preparedness plans that optimise our existing resource; ensuring de-escalation pre-Christmas, maintaining demand and capacity balance between Christmas and the new year and ensuring the provision of enhanced measures for the new year surge; a focus on ambulatory patients and on older persons with emphasis on admission avoidance, enablement and community supports; and strengthened working arrangements with GPs, nursing homes and the HSE.  We can provide more detail on this as we carry out this engagement with the committee.<\/p> <p>  We are grateful for the &euro;10 million once-off funding allocated by the Department of Health for winter.  It is intended to utilise this additional funding to increase the provision of community supports pre-Christmas and open additional capacity in January.<\/p> <p>  Since the last Joint Committee on Health update, we have made some progress on key performance indicators such as trolley count, with each month since the end of quarter one 2018 recording a decrease over the same period in 2017.  Inpatient and day case waiting lists have decreased by over 5,000, from 78,000 in June to 72,700 in September 2018.  That is down from a peak a year ago of 86,000.<\/p> <p>  In the national ambulance service, incidents responded to by patient-carrying vehicles in 18 minutes and 59 seconds or less is above target at 81%, noting a performance improvement month on month in the last quarter.<\/p> <p>  On our community services, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has advised the HSE that all 1,149 disability centres are now registered as of 31 October 2018 under the national standards for residential services for children and adults with disabilities.  This has been a substantial achievement for the sector.  It is a very positive indication regarding our investment in quality improvement through dedicated professional programmes and additional financial resources for providers.<\/p> <p>  However, notwithstanding all of the above, we still have significant pressure on acute, community and social care services.  There are too many people waiting on outpatient waiting lists and there is also a significant increase in the numbers of people attending emergency departments and increasing unmet demand for home care support with over 6,000 people now awaiting home support across the nine community healthcare organisations.  All of these are the subject of detailed planning in our national service plan for 2019.<\/p> <p>  As we move into 2019 we also need to prepare for the introduction of a board to the HSE.  This is a welcome and necessary step for the appropriate governance of the largest organisation in Ireland.  I would particularly like to welcome Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane to the post of chairman.  I know from my early discussions with Mr. Devane that a focus on patient safety and quality and culture and values will be early agenda items for the board.<\/p><p>Consideration of how the HSE responds to recommendations on audit, risk, governance and accountability arising from the Scally report will also be an important aspect of the early work of the board.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to look forward into 2019 and highlight some of the HSE's other key strategic objectives.  Sl&aacute;intecare has provided a framework within which the HSE will focus on transforming healthcare services over the coming decades.  New services will be progressed in line with Government policy and care closer to home will be improved through further investments in primary care services, including GP services, the extension of eligibility and reductions in prescription charges and drug payment scheme limits.  The HSE will also focus on a number of key organisational objectives in 2019, including a designation of the major trauma centre and trauma units in Dublin, commencement of the nine learning sites focused on a new networked operating model for community health networks, which will lead to a full-scale national implementation, further development of maternity services and continued investment in ehealth with a specific focus on electronic health records.

I start with performance and accountability.  In Ireland, we spend more on healthcare than almost any other country on earth.  Budgets over the last number of years have been the highest in our history.  Commensurately, the overruns have been the most extensive we have ever had.  At the same time, we have more people waiting on trolleys than ever and while there have been improvements in some areas, the total number of men, women and children on waiting lists is higher than it has ever been.  Children with special needs are waiting three years to get help, which deprives them of the future they could have.  There are chronic waiting lists on multiple surgical lists and surgeries will have been cancelled across the country this morning because our hospitals are overcrowded.  It is accepted that a safe and good level for hospitals is approximately 85% whereas ours are between 97% and 104%.<\/p> <p>  Certain specialties have particular problems.  Children with scoliosis, for example, are waiting more than three years for operations in Crumlin and, as a result, are having their internal organs crushed by their rib cages as their spines curve to over 100%.  Routine appointments for urology at St. James's involve waiting lists of over six years.  As the Minister knows well, many of our mental health services have become so fractured that people are terrified of children and young persons being referred from early intervention to CAMHS where services basically do not exist.  Government figures released in reply to a parliamentary question recently indicate that we have only one tenth of the staff we need in mental health.  Diagnostics are being cut off for GPs.  I had a letter this week from Navan Hospital to say that due to a shortage of radiographers, GPs can no longer refer for DEXA scanning.  The list goes on and on.<\/p> <p>  In spite of the best efforts of many doctors, nurses and, I am sure, officials, and in spite of the spending of more money than ever before over many years in a row, many parts of the system are in crisis.  There is a level of suffering and a lack of access that we have never seen before.  Given all of that, my question goes to accountability.  Has anyone lost his or her job at a political level, within the Department or anywhere across the HSE?  Has anyone been fired for the catastrophic failures we are seeing across the system notwithstanding the vast amounts of money being spent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#H00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The Deputy's diagnosis, for want of a better term, is one with which I could not agree more.

Into 2019, as the service plan is developed, there will be more emphasis on lowering the intervention and bringing services closer to home.  The Deputy referred to scoliosis and so on in that context.  His question about accountability is one I will refer to the HSE in a minute as it is not in the Minister's gift to fire anyone.  That is a point made to one of my predecessors previously by the head of the HSE.  It is not a hiring and firing role and a matter for any Minister to comment on.

I do not mean to be disrespectful to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I thank him for coming before the committee.  It is regrettable that the Minister is not present.  It is a long time since we have had a quarterly meeting and we are hoping to be able to rectify that.  I fully understand the reason that he is not here this morning, but it is regrettable.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach recently made a statement on annual leave in the hospital service and the difficulties he alleges it creates particularly around Christmas time.  This statement was grossly offensive to men and women, many of whom will work hard right over the Christmas period.  I wonder where that assertion came from.  Does Mr. Connaghan know of a particular problem in January?  How is it accounted for<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>and will he shed some light as to why the Taoiseach said that?  I heard a radio DJ say that he went into a hospital at Christmas and he formed the opinion that there was not much going on.  I do not think that is the truth.  I think a lot goes on over Christmas but perhaps Mr. Connaghan can enlighten us on that.<\/p><p>With regard to recruitment and retention, it is my understanding that we now have 259 fewer staff nurses than we had in December 2017.  I have spoken to nurses and they are telling me that the manner in which the recruitment is taking place is acting as an effective moratorium because it takes so long from the decision to recruit to actually finding oneself in employment on the wards.  Is that being analysed?  Is anyone looking at that and can we get an estimation of where they think the blockages are and how they are manifesting themselves and if there are any plans to tackle them will the witnesses share those plans with us?<\/p><p>If the allocation of &euro;10 million for the winter plan is not spent by the end of the year is it rolled over into next year?  I know it is additional funding but I wonder how it works.  Winter will not be confined to 2018 and it will continue into 2019, is there a plan?  We know that the NHS publishes its winter initiative in September, but we have not seen the winter initiative.  I note what Mr. Connaghan has said but he is listing services that should be happening anyway.  The idea that this is an extraordinary intervention because of winter is a bit much.  What is on the list is the normal day to day activity that should be really happening in our health service.  It would be extraordinary that it does not happen every day of the week.  Will he comment on whether the money will be spent in 2019, and on the funded workforce plan?  Mr. Mulvany and I have spoken about that previously.  As I understand it, there is no funded workforce plan and the matter was referred to a third party for negotiations; will he share with us what stage it is at?<\/p><p>I have more questions, which I will save until afterward, but my final question in this round relates to CervicalCheck.  We were all touched and saddened to read about the case of Ms Julie O'Reilly in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>at the weekend.  She was tested four times and the diagnosis was not given to her each time.  There were pre-cancerous cells present but four times they were missed.  I know that Cian O'Carroll has written in the newspaper that there still has not been an on-site audit of the testing laboratories in the US.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment on that and give us an update as to whether all of the laboratories - I am referring to the laboratories in Honolulu from which initially the referral was made to Texas and there was a further outsourcing of the outsourcing.  I do not want to get into a debate on outsourcing because everybody knows my views on that.  Has there been any on-site testing of every laboratory to which the samples were sent for testing?  Has there been any on-site testing because from my read of what was reported in the newspaper there has been no on-site testing of the laboratories where the tests were analysed?  Will the witness confirm whether there has been on-site testing of laboratories engaged in the analysis of test, and share the results with members?  During the course of one committee hearing we asked officials if they could give us a breakdown of the results between each laboratory, including the outsourced and re-outsourced and we were told months ago that it would be no bother to get the information to the committee, but we still have not got it.  It appears every time we ask a question and it becomes more and more complex.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#J01000","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly.

Many staff slept overnight and did not go home, they stayed to fill the next shift.  I think we owe all the staff in the Irish health service a debt of gratitude for all that service.  Staff go beyond what is in their normal day to day job description when it is needed.  <\/p> <p>  I am not sure where the Taoiseach got the impression he did; one of the things we do - and perhaps it is a matter that we need to explain better - during the course of the last part of December and the early part of January, is suppress electives.

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, who is a friend of mine, but I am very disappointed that the senior Minister, Deputy Harris, is unable to attend this morning.  Obviously, Brexit and the Cabinet meeting in that regard are very important but I note that the committee's quarterly meeting with him has been postponed once already.  It is important that he appear before the year is out.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement the Minister of State acknowledged the dedication of the health service workers.  I was very disappointed by the very unhelpful comments of the Taoiseach regarding health service workers and the Christmas period. <\/p> <p>  I wish to stress the importance of winter planning.  It amazes me that every year it seems to be a surprise that more people need to go to hospital during the winter.  It seems to be an emergency or a surprise every year, but it is quite obvious that it is going to happen.  Ms O'Connor outlined the detail in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  The increase in beds proposed in the national development plan seems very aspirational.  I hope it happens but I do not see how the HSE thinks it can increase bed capacity by 2,600 when there is a maximum potential increase of 319 beds this year and early next year.  The target seems somewhat aspirational.<\/p> <p>  On the first outpatient appointments, it is great that they will try to put a dent in the backlog but what about those who will be coming on stream seeking first-time appointments?<\/p><p>Are people and GPs still being written to, texted or phoned to ask if they want to attend their first appointment?  This puts undue pressure on GPs and patients.<br\/><br\/>I would also like the Minister of State's view on the Ombudsman's comments this morning regarding his disappointment that the HSE has not fully implemented the recommendations in his 2015 report, Learning to Get Better.  At the time, the HSE accepted the 36 of the recommendations in the report but only ten have been fully implemented, 17 have been partially implemented and nine have either not been implemented or are still being considered.  After the Ombudsman went to the trouble of compiling the report, I wonder why all of the 36 recommendations have not been implemented.<br\/><br\/>As this is the Minister of State's quarterly visit to the committee, I have just a few questions for him.  The first concerns the mental health services - which come under the remit of the Minister for Health - at Bantry General Hospital, which is in the constituency the Minister of State and I represent.  I have submitted numerous parliamentary questions and I cannot get answers.  Perhaps the Minister of State can provide answers now or else get back to me.  Is there a dietician <i>in situ<\/i>to speak to people who present with eating disorders? What consultation facilities are available to those presenting with mental health issues?  What are the staffing levels?  As late as yesterday, I received a reply to a simple question on the staffing levels but I did not get an answer.  There are either ten or 20 staff or none.  I would like an answer please.  Lisheens House is a facility in our constituency that does not receive any section 39 funding.  Why is that?  Why did the facility have to wait until October for a decision that was due in March and which turned out to be a refusal?  I asked this of the Taoiseach yesterday, but he said to ask the Minister of State.  I am doing so now.<br\/><br\/>I have a few more questions for the Minister because as I could not expect the Minister of State to know the answers.  I will wait for our meeting with the Minister to ask those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#K04600","speaker":"1262","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Not every Minister has quarterly meetings with their corresponding committee.  The Minister has always prioritised and tried to attend these meetings as a priority.  I know that I catch the flak more often than not when he cannot make it, but it is certainly not due to lack on interest on his part.  I am aware the members are not suggesting that but I just wanted to make the point that he has always tried to prioritise his attendance at these quarterly meetings.<\/p> <p>  I wish to correct what the Deputy said.  The Taoiseach did not criticise front-line workers.  There is a political attraction for all of us in interpreting what the Taoiseach said.  To be fair, he referred to workforce planning and the availability of staff.  Deputy O'Reilly touched on that issue in the context of diagnostic staff.  I am not speaking for the Taoiseach; he is a very articulate man and well able to outline his views.  I do not wish to interpret what he said.  There is a point to be made, however, which a lot of people accept - regardless of whether we like it  - that some steps can be taken to improve workflow and patient flow at different times.  I refer, for example, to circumstances where a lot of people might come into an acute hospital and diagnostic services might not be available because they only operate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  If diagnostic services were available for longer, more procedures could be performed.  There is merit to that and a bit of focus on it would be welcome.  The Taoiseach was certainly not criticising front-line staff.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy inquired about bed capacity.  The bed capacity is to be achieved over ten years.  The figure of 319 is for one year.  The question that arises relates to how to get to 3,200 beds over a period of ten years.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to outpatient appointments and new people coming in.  The do-not-shows constitute only one part of that.  We hope that 30,000 will be eliminated from that list when it is tidied up.  We are working towards the Sl&aacute;intecare plan to bring the care to the lower level whereby people can be treated at primary care centres.  That is probably the answer to the Deputy's question on how we intend to deal with the new clients who will come onto the list, as well as those who have been waiting a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#L00700","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#L00800","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":437,"content":"<p>This is part of the overall reform that is very much at the heart of Sl&aacute;intecare, namely, changing where certain people are treated and giving them appointments closer to home.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony spoke about letters to patients.

Contrary to popular belief locally, section 39 funding is administered by the HSE, not by me.  The people at Lisheens House were certainly of that view.  I allocate to the HSE and it allocates to organisations.  When I looked at the number of organisations that are availing of funding for mental health, the heading under which Lisheens House comes, there are 1,050 different organisations in receipt of funding from the HSE.  Ultimately, that funding comes from the Department's budget.  There is no question about the number of organisations - 1,050 in total - that are in receipt of this money.  We have to have corporate governance and clinical governance.  I have explained this to the people at Lisheens House.

Before I go to Deputy Durkan, I have a number of questions, the first of which is directed to Mr. Breslin and Mr. Connaghan.<\/p><p>Invariably, the HSE service plan, which will be produced in the next several weeks, will not deliver because of budget overruns of up to &euro;700 million like this year.  What guarantee can be given that the service plan will come in on target next year?  Several weeks ago, Mr. Stephen Mulvany explained to the committee the various components of the overrun, such as demographics, unforeseen events, etc.  Surely these events are factored into the service plan.<\/p><p> I understand the planning for the winter initiative is well under way.  Surely, the plan should be well advanced by, if not delivered prior to, 1 December.  I take it the HSE anticipates the winter coming and the plan should be developed long before the period it will cover.  Why has it taken so long this year to develop the winter initiative, as opposed to other years?<\/p><p> Mr. John Connaghan said the trolley numbers have been decreasing from the first quarter of this year compared to those for last year.  That is not the case with the figures I have been calculating.  The trolley count has gone up month on month, year on year.  There is no reduction in the number of people on trolleys month on month since the beginning of this year.  Is the HSE using different figures to those produced by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, in its trolley watch?<\/p><p> The number of people waiting for inpatient treatment has fallen from 86,000 to 72,000.  How many of those have been actual treatments as opposed to validating people who no longer require treatment?<\/p><p> We have discussed Sl&aacute;intecare time out of number here.  There seems to be a significant lack of urgency with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  One aspect specifically is the 2,600 beds which are to come on stream over the next ten years through the national development plan.  Those beds are also identified in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will be 2021 before there is any move in building new beds.  There are 240 beds, plus 79 more, coming on stream in the next number of months.  These will be so far down the line that it seems inconceivable that our demographics will be able to be accommodated within the current bed structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#L02900","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>It is regrettable the Supplementary Estimate is the size it is this year.  I would not accept, however, that it is &euro;700 million every year.  We were here last year with a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;195 million.  In fairness to the HSE, significant parts of that were due to centrally made decisions.  For example, &euro;75 million of the figure from last year's Supplementary Estimate involved bringing forward the national pay agreement.  There will be times the Government makes a decision to take a policy initiative or on pay which imposes costs on the HSE.  The Government then proposes to the Oireachtas that such decisions must be funded.<\/p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate is not unique to the HSE.  It happens across the public service.  The HSE is the largest funded organisation in the State.  When it has those issues, it involves hundreds of millions of euro when for other Departments it may involve tens of millions of euro.<\/p> <p>  That does not take away from the regret that I have about the &euro;700 million this year.  That is substantially beyond any type of margin around the Government making decisions over and above what is in the service plan.  Some of that is due to subsequent decisions made by the Government.  The slippage this year is beyond what we had planned for and what we expected.  We are advanced in the process with the HSE of developing the service plan for next year.  The objective is that we develop a service plan that is fully funded, not one that is partially funded.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to the Chairman before about Sl&aacute;intecare.  From where he is sitting, it might look like a lack of urgency.  From where I sit, I see people running to get Sl&aacute;intecare implemented.  I see the executive director for Sl&aacute;intecare putting a significant focus on it.  I see the teams across the Department and the HSE putting a significant focus into getting Sl&aacute;intecare done.  The implementation plan for next year, which will be developed next month, will show in a practical way what the milestones are.  I am confident that we will have significant milestones delivered next year.  One of the areas we will be able to show form on is one that the Chair has always raised when we have been before the committee, namely putting a framework in place for general practice which will start to modernise it, make it more sustainable and attract people to work in that area.  I am confident that this will start to bear fruit.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the 240 and the other 79 beds.  We will make decisions with the HSE on further bed capacity to be introduced in 2019-2020 over and above that.  There will be further beds to be introduced.  It is worth reflecting on the fact that the bed capacity report stated that without reform, we will need more than 7,000 beds.  It is not a bed capacity report which is about 260 beds.  It is a bed capacity report which references 2,600 beds but with significant reform as to how we are currently organised and how resources are distributed to clients.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to what Deputy Donnelly asked earlier, this is not the most effective and efficient way to organise a health service.  Sl&aacute;intecare shows us how we not only right-size the health service but how we change how it is organised.  Significant change is required.  We will have to shift our health service away from acute-focused and episodic service into one that is preventive and works with people on diseases to avoid acute presentations.  If we do not get that right, we will not be able to tackle the demographic challenges we face.  We will have plans for further bed capacity.  Like the GP framework, we also have to strongly support and plan the shift in resources that we will need to ensure more integrated care with less focus on beds as the only part of the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>It is important to consider that the introduction of new capacity in line with Sl&aacute;intecare ambitions needs to consider not just infrastructure, which is required in terms of new physical beds, but also workforce.

It is important we understand that it accounts for whole system planning around this.<\/p> <p>  As regards trolley counts, the INMO calculates things differently.

I worry about the deployment of personnel, an issue I have raised on many occasions in the past.  <\/p> <p>  To what extent does the deployment of staff, resources and equipment within the health services in general and in public hospitals have an impact on the delivery of services?  Second, the structures for the delivery of services are wrong.  I have also raised this issue on numerous occasions.  This has not been addressed and I hope it will be.  For example, if there are 20,000 on the waiting lists, what do we do about it?  Do we start by doing a calculation of how long it will take to clear the waiting list?  How many more people will have joined the waiting list in the intervening period?  Do we decide on a strategy to clear the 20,000 independently of whatever else is happening and deal with the cohort of patients as they arrive on the scene?  I have said many times previously that there is no need for waiting listing at all, other than minimum waiting lists.  There is no basis for having a two, three, four, five or six-month waiting list.  We rely on the long list and how it will take to deal with it.  One can do a calculation at any time and say it will take five years before that patient will be dealt with or six years, depending on the emergency cases that come through in the meantime.  That is the problem.  Has an audit been done to identify the deficiencies in the system that slow down the throughflow of patients?

That was a mantra up to seven or eight years ago.  I do not know why that was the case, but it was.  The needs of people would be addressed in a different way so fewer beds were required.  That did not work.  In the case of crowded corridors and patients on trolleys in the reception areas of hospitals, can we be assured that there is no vacant space in decommissioned wards in the same hospitals and-or can we ascertain at this stage the extent to which plans are afoot to provide accommodation adjacent to those hospitals, having regard to the experience in the past number of years, particularly in regard to the winter initiative?

I have some questions for Mr. Connaghan and others relating to the CervicalCheck issue which could be answered by Mr. McCallion or Mr. Connaghan.  This will be a quick-fire round because we only have a certain amount of time for questions.<\/p> <p>  Is Mr. Connaghan considering any structural changes of the directorates under him in the HSE?  If so, what are they?  My question on winter planning has been addressed so I do not wish to spend time on it except to say that the fact we do not have a plan is crazy.  What is the timeline for the development of the new rapid-build units in Limerick and Clonmel?<\/p> <p>  When will the agreement be signed with the relevant drug company in regard to Respreeza?  This matter has been going on for over a year.  I have spoken publicly about a neighbour of mine named Marian Kelly - no relation - who died after being taken off the drug.   Last week her daughter met the Minister, Deputy Harris, in Nenagh when he was opening a facility there.  I understand a deal is very close.  Her children wish to honour their mother by ensuring that every person who needs this drug will receive it.  When will the agreement be signed?  The response from the HSE on this issue has not been very good in terms of communication.<\/p> <p>  Will the HSE consider decentralising recruitment for 2019?  The centralisation of recruitment up to a certain level is taking too long and is not a good idea.  I have been contacted by qualified people seeking nursing jobs who want to work and stay in Ireland but cannot work for the HSE because the process takes too long.  In one case of which I am aware a person who wishes to work in a region has been waiting six months for a post.  I have also had this verified in other ways.  Could recruitment up to a certain level be decentralised in the regions?  It would work better and I ask the witnesses to consider it.<\/p> <p>  I asked Mr. McCallion some brief questions on cervical screening in another forum last week.  On the 20-week wait for screening, It was confirmed to me that women triaged as requiring screening possibly within six months are in the same boat as women seeking a triennial check-up and the HSE cannot distinguish between the two groups.  That could have a negative medical impact on women's lives.  A person for whom a check-up within six months has been recommended and another who is seeking a three-yearly smear test will both experience a 20-week delay.  The different categories should be distinguished and prioritised according to need.  I raised this issue last week and received a very honest response which was one of the best I have received at a committee.  However, the issue must be dealt with and I ask Mr. Connaghan to confirm that the HSE is doing so.<\/p> <p>  I seek some basic facts regarding the 221 women.  How many are, unfortunately, deceased; how many are in the middle of treatment; and how many are post-cancer?  I am seeking a breakdown of the total number of smears those women had and the labs in which those smears were read.  The fact that we have been waiting over six months for this information is unacceptable and does not breed confidence.  When will the audit recommence?  It is not good enough that it has stopped.  All the variables have stayed the same.<\/p><p>From 1 January onwards, with all the variables staying the same and with no audit, it means that <i>pro rata<\/i>, more women are being affected in some way.  When will it commence again and how will the HSE deal with that?<br\/><br\/>I appreciate that Mr. McCallion gave me information last week and he may have an update this week on why it is taking so long.  I do not want to misquote him and am open to correction but I believe he said it was 22 days on average.  It turns out that many women are waiting three to four months to get their slides.  There is a breakdown here somewhere.  What is it and why are women waiting so long?<br\/><br\/>With regard to the impact of the Scally report, what action has Mr. Connaghan taken outside of the recommendations made by Dr. Scally?  I understand the HSE will implement all the recommendations.  I refer to issues concerning the burden of duty in the laboratories and note that cases are being settled by the laboratories because there was a burden of duty.  I asked the State Claims Agency a question last week about how many cases involved negligence.  In cases where we are aware of an issue with the laboratory, why are the laboratories not being inspected by the HSE?  Under any other normal contractual relationship, in cases where there was a known issue with a laboratory, it would be inspected.  Those are my questions and I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#O02000","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>As time is short, I will make \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers to this.

We have spoken to them and we intend to get one of our healthcare audit team members to undertake the clinical status and the factual position.

Obviously it will anonymised when feeding it back.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's last point was about the breakdown of the figures in respect of the 221 women.  I had mentioned this previously in response to an earlier question.  One of the challenges for us is we have not had a cytopathologist in the programme.  This issue was recognised by Dr. Scally as a deficit.  We saw this ourselves and the HSE tried to recruit for that position even prior to Dr. Scally's report.  We have been unsuccessful in that and we have gone twice to recruit.  I am now in discussions with a person overseas about coming to Ireland and taking up a contract here.  That is crucial in getting the breakdown because, for example, within the 221 women who have been impacted, many had multiple smear tests that went to multiple laboratories over different time periods.  The laboratories that were used in Ireland in the earlier stages would have detected higher rates of abnormalities because they were detecting more cervical cancers in the early stage of the programme.  We need a cytopathologist to do that work.  While I am trying to conclude recruiting a person on a full-time basis this is an ongoing need and not just for the audit issue.  I have also managed to source a person, again from outside the State, who will undertake that specific piece of work over the next four or five weeks.  We intend to conclude that work separately over the next four to five weeks.

I also thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for attending to deal with our questions.<\/p> <p>  A new acute hospital for Cork is proposed in the national development plan.  A committee was set up to help identify a site but my understanding is that it has not yet met.  Even to identify a site is going to take some time.  I am concerned about the growth of population in Cork.  It has gone up by over 130,000 people in a short time.  Even if we start a new hospital in the morning, the population increase in Cork will be between 160,000 and 170,000 people.  This will put significant pressure on Cork's existing hospitals.  Can we be provided with a timeline for the hospital's construction?  From the initial identifying of a suitable site to the planning process thereafter could take up to two to three years.  I want this to be moved on.  Nothing seems to have happened on this issue so far.<\/p> <p>  On staffing numbers in the HSE, the number of nurses in real terms from December 2014 to December 2018 will have increased by 629.  At the same time, the number of nurse managers has increased by 1,093, going from 6,602 to 7,695.  The number of whole-time equivalent consultants has increased by 397.  Is there a detailed plan as regards recruitment in the HSE and strategy?  I am concerned that management and administration has gone from 15,112 to 18,131, an increase of 3,019.  This is now higher than it ever was prior to the cutbacks.  We do not seem to be able to get people on the front line, however.<\/p> <p>  Agency doctors have cost &euro;110 million in the past 12 months.  We could actually recruit 500 additional consultants at a higher pay than what is being offered at the moment.  Using &euro;110 million to pay 500 consultants would mean a salary of &euro;220,000 per consultant.  We have a figure where it is not attractive for people to come back, in particular to Dublin with the cost of housing.  Will we review this?  If so, when?  When will a package be provided that will have a far better return as regards having permanent people employed rather than agency staff members who we do not know from one month to the next if they will be there or not?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jim Breslin said we need to move away from an over-reliance on the hospital system.  Part of the solution to that relates to GP services.  Where are we with the GP contracts issue?  It is a concern among general practitioners, particularly regarding how they do not know how to plan the development of their practice over the next three to four years.  These contract negotiations have been going on for quite a long time.  I pulled out one of my press releases recently, dated August 2016, in which I was looking for the contract negotiations to be fast-tracked.  Two years later, we do not seem to have made progress.  I am concerned that, on the one hand, we do not burden the hospitals but, on the other, when we need people on the front line, we do not encourage them to provide the service we require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#Q00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to the committee.

The population of Cork, as Senator Colm Burke outlined, has grown significantly but the health service has not grown in the region to meet its needs, most certainly from an acute hospital bed point of view.  We have secured funding in the national development plan to develop to deliver a new acute hospital for Cork but also elective-only hospitals for Cork, Galway and Dublin.  This will have a significant transformational effect on the delivery of scheduled care and improvements to our waiting lists.  The director general of the HSE recently brought me to Scotland  where we looked at how its elective-only model has transformed its waiting lists.  This was part of the process for developing our elective-only models here.<\/p> <p>  Once we have finalised the capital plan with the HSE in the coming weeks, I will work with the Department to put a structure in place to advance the preparatory work that the Senator identified needs to be done.  I hope by year end that we could have a clear outline as to what that preparatory work looks like, who will do it, as well as what responsibility lies with the Department in terms of policy formation and with the HSE and the hospital groups in terms of delivering it on the ground.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the GP contract, we are not talking about this in an abstract concept.  Negotiations are going on every week.  There are GP contract negotiations taking place in my Department with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  Both sides have said publicly that they want these talks to conclude by the end of this year.  I expect that they will.  We have a sizeable sum of money to invest in general practice on a multi-annual basis, agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, myself and the Taoiseach.  This is a level of investment which will enable us to make general practice sustainable.  General practice has rightly said that it has suffered cuts, FEMPI cuts and so forth, through successive Governments during the economic recession.  We need to move beyond that and address it in terms of sustainability.  Second, we must examine how general practitioners, if resourced to do so, can do more procedures which are currently done in hospital settings, specifically around the whole area of chronic disease management.  Third, there is the whole area of access.  The Oireachtas signed off on the Sl&aacute;intecare plan, which wants to see many more people access GP care either for free or at low cost.<\/p><p>How can we do more to improve on access, chronic disease management and sustainability?  I hear people misrepresent my position on this regularly, suggesting that my officials and I are only talking to general practitioners about doing more and giving them more resources to do more.  People who make that argument intentionally ignore what I have just said, that a very important part of that conversation is about the sustainability of the existing services and the resources that are required to do fulfil the role.  I expect those discussions to conclude by the end of the year.  It is a very exciting piece of work and has taken far longer anybody than would have wanted, particularly far longer than GPs would have wanted.  This significant piece of work is potentially transformational for the health service and is very much in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and I look forward to it concluding.<\/p><p> I will ask Mr. Connaghan to deal with the staff recruitment measures.  Senator Colm Burke and I engage on issues regularly enough at this committee, but I need to make this point.  Sometimes when our discussions on managers and administrators are reported there is a suggestion that such staff bring no added value to the health service.  Of course, that is not the case.  Many of the questions, such as parliamentary questions, and the issues raised in Topical Issue and Commencement matter debates are about how we manage our outpatient clinic appointment.  When we put more staff into outpatient clinics, they might be counted as administrative staff but they are very much helping to play a front-line role.  We should do further work on explaining the value individuals who work very hard add to our health service.  I will now pass over to Mr. Connaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#Q00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The Senator is correct that we should be prudent about spending any money that takes away from front-line services.  Let me make members aware that we have a business case process for the appointment of any senior executive or manager and such appointments are the subject of a very vigorous business case and the approval process is shared with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Members have commented on the growth in staff numbers in recent years.  We have created delegated units in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and in hospital groups and it is important that we staff these appropriately in terms of governance.<\/p> <p>  It is useful to refer to other countries in terms of a comparison with where we are.  The experience in the NHS in England is that the senior management cohort is about 5% of senior and middle management and that compares exactly with the current Irish figure.  The percentage of very senior managers in the HSE is less than 1%.<\/p> <p>  I will take up the point the Minister just raised about where administrative and clerical staff take on tasks that used to be done by clinicians.  There is a scarcity in some clinical specialties and it makes sense to try to divert some of the non-direct clinical services task to the administrative and clerical function.  That is a good thing because it allows clinicians to run at the top of their licence.<\/p> <p>  Let us look into the future.  We have just been allocated &euro;250 million from the European Investment Bank to bring forward our plans to create more in the way of electronic healthcare records.  In order to bring that forward, we will have to add some of the specialists, the programmers, the system developers and the support staff.  That might be for a transitory period but as I look into 2019 and through to 2021, I anticipate some growth in the management posts to enable that to happen.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Colm Henry to say a brief word on recruitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Like many other European countries, we face significant challenges with medical recruitment.

There can be no break in unscheduled care once we have announced we have unscheduled care, be it in obstetrics, paediatrics, medicine, surgery or anaesthetics, and there has to be staff ready to see and care for patients.  That explains to some degree our dependency on agency and locums because such a service by definition is unbroken.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made a point earlier about the way people work.  Sl&aacute;intecare is a critical enabler.  We are changing the way people work now.  The deputy director general of operations and I attended a meeting earlier this week, a conference of health and social care professionals who demonstrated how innovative staff are.  They are not just hard working but they brought in initiatives in Beaumont Hospital, in Kilkenny and in the community where they are working, outside their traditional boundaries and bringing Sl&aacute;intecare into practice before it is being implemented.

I want to discuss the recruitment and retention crisis and his views on what is happening.  Let me start with consultants.  We know one in five consultant posts is currently vacant and that a very small number of consultants are applying for vacant posts relative to ten years ago.  We know that in many hospitals it is becoming impossible to hire-in consultants particularly when more experienced consultants are needed.  We know there has been an increased use of locums, which has risen by one third between May and October of this year.  There are allegations that some of these locums are not as well qualified as consultants would be and obviously they can cost more money.  We know that several areas are now losing specialist services.  Let me give examples.  Kerry University Hospital is about to lose its only histopathologist, which puts cancer screening services, including CervicalCheck and many other surgical services, at risk.  My understanding is that Cork is not hiring additional resource and there is no plan in place yet to deal with this.  Tralee has recently lost its rheumatologist.  Patients are now being referred to Cork but at present there is a two year waiting list with 1,500 patients already waiting to be seen.  I am told that unless somebody has an extremely urgent case, there is no realistic plan to ever see them.  This week the hospital in Tralee lost its urologist and we are told that in Kerry, they are now struggling to get the locums for these posts.<\/p><p>We have discussed the situation in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children.  Children with scoliosis are waiting more than three years for operations.  In the urology department in St James's Hospital,  the waiting list for a routine appointment is now more than six years.  The list goes on and on.  We can talk about hospitals all over the country.  The scarcity of qualified consultants has now become so acute that they are beginning to shut down services for patients.  <\/p><p>There are also serious issues when it comes to nurses and midwives.  The INMO told me recently that it estimates that the services are now short approximately 175 midwives, which is a very large number.  Galway University Hospital has 16 operating theatres, five of which, that is, one third of the region's entire surgical throughput capacity for the only level four hospital in the area, are permanently closed.  The reason given to me for these closed surgical theatres is that they are not able to hire a relatively small number of theatre nurses.  We know agencies are paying nurses on the fifth point on the scale and an additional 20% on top of that.  Agencies are paying nurses 50% more, relative to a new entrant nurse in the public system.  The INMO, as I am sure the witnesses are acutely aware, is balloting for strike action, to include work stoppages, on Monday.  The INMO understands that a <i>de facto<\/i>moratorium on recruitment is now in place for the rest of this year due to budget constraints.  It told me that 57 nurses were meant to be hired to help support patients on trolleys in the upcoming winter crisis but they are now not being hired.<\/p><p>Does the Minister accept there is a crisis in recruitment and retention both for consultant posts and for nurses and midwives?  Does he accept that the new entrant pay equality discrepancy is a major driver of that crisis?  Why have talks not started with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, which represents more than 90% of the consultants in the system?  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association says it has tried to meet the Minister and has been trying to meet officials for a year but cannot get any meaningful engagement.  Nurses and midwives have not gone on strike in nearly 20 years.<\/p><p>In the context of us spending more money on the health service than ever before, with considerable overruns, how has it been allowed to get so bad for nurses that they have got to the point where they feel they must ballot for strike action?  Will the Minister confirm whether there is a de facto moratorium on hiring for the rest of this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#R00500","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I fully accept that the recruitment environment in the health service is challenging, and that we operate within a global labour market for many of these consultancy positions but also for nursing positions.  Highly educated consultants, nurses and midwives from Ireland are sought after in other countries and we operate very much in a global environment.  I do not accept the comments without a degree of context, however, because if I was take them without context it would suggest fewer consultants are working in the health service but that is not true.  An additional 115 consultants are working in the Irish health service compared with 12 months ago.  While I take the Deputy's point about there being much more to do despite the large number of vacant posts, which is a statement of fact beyond dispute, there were 115 more consultants working in the public health service in September 2018 than in September 2017.  Similarly, there are 523 more consultants working in the health service than five years ago.  Nonetheless, I accept there are challenges with the number of doctors working in the health service, as there are with nurses.<\/p> <p>  The issue of new entrant pay must be examined, just as it was examined within other elements of the public service.  The Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC is a structure we set up to examine the issue of recruitment and retention, and, in fairness, it was supported by the Deputy's party.  It made a number of suggestions, all of which were accepted by Government but it also found a further process should be considered as to how the State and consultants could engage on the issue of new entrant pay.  That decision is not one for me exclusively but rather for me with colleagues across Government, although I would like to see the issue advanced.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of consultants in Crumlin hospital which the Deputy raised, I would be happy to send some information on the matter to him and the committee.  The information suggests, as the Deputy also did, that pay is an issue but not the sole issue.  I recently met the Children's hospital group, which was able to tell me there has been a significant increase in the number of people who want to work as clinicians in our children's hospitals, which the group explains is partly because there will be &euro;1 billion in infrastructure that will give our clinicians more theatre space and better, modern facilities and research capacity.  When I meet consultants, as I do, they tell me that while pay is an element, being able to see their patients and ensuring their patients have beds and theatres are also elements.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of non-engagement with the IHCA is not borne out by fact.  My Department was represented at a ministerial level at its conference, at which I know the Deputy was also in attendance.  I am familiar with its issues.<\/p> <p>  On the INMO, there is ongoing engagement.  I hope we can find a way of resolving what is a brewing industrial relations dispute, but parties to the pay agreement undertook not to submit new pay claims during the duration of that agreement.  I do not mean to speak for Fianna F&aacute;il but I think it holds a similar position to the Government on the matter.  Parties to the public service stability agreement signed up to it and, as a result, are subject to the terms and conditions of it.  The PSPC wants to see additional resources put in the pockets of nurses, whether by allowances, resolving the new entrant pay issue or enabling them to become a senior staff nurse at an earlier point in their careers.  <\/p> <p>  While much more must be done to support our nurses, such as increased financial remuneration, we asked the PSPC, rather than a bunch of politicians, to examine how recruitment and retention in nursing can be fixed and it reverted with a series of recommendations.  The Government adopted them in full and wants to deliver on them in 2019.  In the budget architecture, the Deputy's party and mine agreed we have funded that.  I would like to engage with the INMO on other issues in the health service that could assist and support nurses in doing their jobs, as well as on many other matters that would be inappropriate for me to raise in this forum because discussions are ongoing.  There are other approaches, aside from pay, that I am sure could assist our nurses working in a challenging environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#S00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>We have covered much ground but I would like to return to the specific questions.

I am talking about meaningful engagement.

While the overall number may have risen, it is falling relative to the need, in view of the fact that one in five posts are not filled.  What does the Department propose to do as a result?

Regardless of the validity of that pay claim, and it is not for me to assess people's motives, the public service stability agreement is clear on pay claims during its duration.  Nurses believe they have a legitimate pay claim, the State has an infrastructure to deal with these matters and I hope everyone uses the processes available to them.  While there are clear mechanisms in place to resolve this, there are also measures that we want to take to help support our nurses.<\/p> <p>  I fully accept the conclusive and definitive outcome of their ballot, but I also accept that the INMO are members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and public service pay agreements are in place, to which the Deputy's party and mine are subject.  We are committed to supporting these agreements and we need to operate within that infrastructure.  The nurses decided to take the view that their pay should be increased in a sectoral-specific way without considering the rest of the public service and the knock-on effects thereof.  That is their position and I cannot comment on why the nurses decided to take it, but I accept our nurses work in a challenging environment.  I also accept the recommendations of the PSPC, which would benefit many thousands of nurses, should be advanced as a priority, and that there is much more we need to do to help and support our nurses.  As Minister for Health, I would like to engage on what we can do within the health service separate to the process of public service pay agreements.<\/p> <p>  Whether I used the word \"crisis\" or \"challenge\" is somewhat pedantic because whether I call it a crisis will not help or make a difference.  The former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, used to call things an emergency, but did that help or make a difference?  There is a real challenge in recruiting consultants, as there is in the retention of nurses and midwives, which the PSPC found.  As for what we should do, I suggest we adopt in full the findings of the PSPC, as we have done.  It made findings and recommendations which we should get on with implementing.  We committed to doing that and we are funded to do it in 2019.  We must also explore how we establish the process to look at the new entrant pay issue, which is not an issue exclusively in my remit.  I take an active interest in it, however, and I am partly responsible.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we will do to help, and there are other measures we can take.  In addition to what I outlined, we can also increase theatre capacity, build elective-only hospitals and provide more bed capacity, because we have found that when we invest in the physical infrastructure of our health service, and when we provide doctors and nurses with the tools and resources to do their jobs, they respond in kind by wanting jobs in that health service.<\/p><p>We are very much seeing that now in respect of the children's hospital group and I will send information to the committee illustrating that point.<\/p><p> I will return to the issue of engagement with consultant representative bodies, although I will not get into a back-and-forth on it here.  More than one body represents consultants.  Some are members of the IMO while others are members of the IHCA, neither of which is a union, as they remind me, as consultants have individual contracts with our health service.  My Department rightly spent a great deal of time in recent months, along with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, resolving a major issue relating to consultants and the fulfilment of their contracts, which had in their view not been fulfilled or honoured in many years.  Mary Harney was Minister for Health at the time the issue arose and it continued until we resolved it this time.  That resulted in a significant cost to the State but it was the right thing to do.  The notion that there has not been meaningful engagement is not correct.  We took what was probably the most challenging issue being put forward by the IHCA and successfully resolved it in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#S00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I have a quick follow-up question for Mr. Connaghan as acting director general of the HSE.

If we have doctors, whether there are five or 50 of them, in the healthcare system with little knowledge of the basics of medicine, we need to find out who they are.  It is not about attacking them or anything like that but there is a patient protection issue here.  Given such a senior judge has said this, will the Minister undertake to commission an audit?  As a matter of urgency, he needs to find out not only how it is happening but also where these doctors are, if they currently pose a danger, and if we can help them, for example, through additional training.

I received a significant volume of information, which I do not feel is appropriate to share in a public forum, about one individual.  I have been provided with information and assurance of a system that is largely - I want to decouple what I am going to say here - a system that took swift action when an issue came to light.  In respect of a doctor who was working in a hospital for a very short number of days under supervision at all times at a very junior level, the proper procedures were followed very quickly and we know where that case ended up in terms of the Medical Council complaint.<\/p> <p>  I want to say to people watching, to people using our health services and to doctors in our health services that almost 23,000 doctors are registered with the Medical Council.  In 2017, the last year for which figures are available, there were approximately 300 complaints and three doctors were struck off the medical register.  The idea that there is a widespread of issue of doctors, whom I have heard referred to as rogue doctors, wandering around our hospitals is not borne out by evidence.  There is an issue, though, which Mr. Justice Kelly and the Deputy have rightly highlighted, in respect of our recruitment process and making sure there are learnings from this case.  I can assure him that in respect of the composition of the interview board, references and the use of a scoring technique, all the proper procedures were followed.  This doctor was placed on a panel and called to fill a post.  He was supervised at all times and when it became clear that he still lacked the competencies that were required, swift action was taken.<\/p> <p>  I have taken appropriate action.  I have written to the HSE and received correspondence back, which I will consider in full.  I will also consider the process which the HSE might now outline and which they are undergoing in respect of reforming the recruitment model.  I will also meet the Medical Council specifically on this issue.  I am scheduled to meet council representatives shortly; I will confirm the date with the Deputy.  The Medical Council has also highlighted its concerns to the HSE.  There is an issue we need to fix here in respect of the recruitment process, not just in this matter but also in the general streamlining of our recruitment processes.  I very much accept the Deputy's bona fides and do not believe it is what he wished to suggest, but to announce a widespread audit would cause undue concern and it would be disproportionate.  I very much welcome the IMO's comments in this regard last weekend.  The appropriate thing to do is review the case, which I have done, make sure learnings are applied across the HSE and that the recruitment model is reformed, and meet the Medical Council.  If, after that, I believe further action is required, I will take it.  It might be useful to hear from Dr. Colm Henry as the chief clinical officer of the HSE on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#T00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Deputy.  It is important to assure members of the public who might have concerns arising from this case.  Of our complement of junior doctors in the system, approximately half are in training schemes and they are recruited through training colleges.  There is a solid, robust basis for that and they are generally known to our system, having come through our medical schools and worked in our hospital system, and they have references from people we know.  We have a dependency on non-training doctors arising out of Working Time Directive compliance issues some years ago.  All junior doctors - and I say this from personal experience - undergo mentoring and supervision appropriate not just to their level but to their background.  This case, about which we cannot go into too much detail, highlights how effective the mentoring and supervision can be.  The interview is one part of a process.  We cannot validate everybody's background and entire knowledge and experience based on a half-hour interview, no matter how thorough it might be.  If there are concerns and the candidate has come from a medical school with which the recruitment board members are not familiar and has references from people they do not know, he or she will be monitored closely because no senior doctor or consultant can afford to take risks when it comes to patient safety.  This particular case is unusual but it highlights how effective the mentoring and supervision was, in that concerns were brought to light quickly before there was any contact with patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.

The last nurses' strike in which I was involved was in 2009 in Sligo. There one in Limerick that year and an all-out national strike.  I am sitting across from people who I am sure will fondly remember those times.<\/p><p>I love how the national wage agreement is selectively quoted, just as I did when I was a union official.  There is a clause in the agreement of which the Minister will be aware because I have told him about it several times.  Others will be aware of it also.  It states that the parties reserve the right to return to renegotiate the agreement in the event that circumstances change.  When circumstances changed several years ago, nurses, midwives, and every other worker in the health service, including those opposite, those agreements were renegotiated to facilitate a cut in pay.  No agreement is immune to renegotiation as I was often told by those who wanted to do so.<\/p><p>I would like to get some comfort from the witnesses on home care packages.  A lady named Margaret O'Reilly was on the radio yesterday.  She is a double amputee who is waiting on home care and home care support.  She and others, some of whom work in the health service and some who have told us confidentially, assert that the budget has been spent and there is no more money for home care packages between now and the end of the year.  Is this the practice?  People have told us that they not being allocated sufficient hours, and we could argue all day whether we can ever have enough hours.  Some of this information is anecdotal and I have put down parliamentary questions to get to the bottom of the matter but I would like confirmation on whether there has been an effective ban on additional home care packages because the money has run out.<\/p><p>Pay is central to recruitment and retention.  When INMO general secretary, Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, appeared before the committee she disputed something Deputy Donnelly said.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>Irish nurses are not well paid by comparison.  We have international comparisons that are compiled not by us but by the International Council of Nurses, affiliated to the World Health Organization.  They clearly indicate that, out of the nine main countries that are English-speaking with western medical styles, Ireland's pay is the lowest.<\/blockquote> <p>That is borne out by the numbers of nurses who are graduating and leaving the country.  Pay must be central.  Mr. Mulvany and I have spoken previously about the conversion of agency staff into directly employed staff.  Are there targets for this?  If so, are they being reached?  Is there a money-saving target, or does it relate to personnel, that is, how is it being quantified?  What is the figure for targets that have been allocated for this year?  Have these been reached?  What will be allocated for next year?<\/p><p>I refer to consultants who are not on the specialist register but are being paid as consultants, which relates to an issue raised earlier.  I asked Ms Rosarii Mannion about this when she appeared before the committee on a previous occasion.  How many are there?  The witnesses must know.  There are a certain number working as consultants who are not on the specialist register and who are getting closer to a contract of indefinite duration by the day.  What is being done to ensure that they get the qualifications that mean they can be added to the specialist register?<\/p><p>The Taoiseach's comments about holidays were referred to earlier.  There was a specific reference to nurses and doctors which was offensive to them.<\/p><p>On access to diagnostics, is it the case that it is an issue of staff but rather than an unwillingness of staff to work out of hours?  My understanding is that there is an agreement in place going back to Towards 2016, which was in place from 2006, a section of which referred specifically to the operation of out-of-hours.  That was around 13 years ago.  I do not think there is a problem in getting staff to work, but with the actual staff numbers.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p><p>I refer to CervicalCheck.  I may have spoken incorrectly earlier.  What Mr. O&rsquo;Carroll said is that no on-site audit was conducted in the outsourced laboratories.  I do not know what the difference is between a visit and an on-sight audit.  Mr. McCallion will know this.

I must remind the Oireachtas that was my initial starting point when the CervicalCheck debacle began.  I proposed a HIQA statutory investigation, where HIQA would have all the powers required to investigate all these matters.  The Oireachtas quite rightly said that considering the circumstances I should bring in someone external, possibly from outside the jurisdiction.  It was an instance of where engagement really works.  That person was Dr. Scally, and he did the work.  Mr. McCallion will respond to Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question directly but I wanted to take the opportunity to say that.<\/p> <p>  I will bring the committee up-to-date on the nurses&rsquo; dispute as there have been developments in the last few minutes.

When two sides to a dispute have a different view on whether a claim can or cannot be processed, the appropriate thing to do is to refer it to the oversight body that was established to oversee that agreement.  That is what we intend to do.  The oversight body is the appropriate vehicle.  I ask both sides to this dispute to engage fully with that but also that people reflect on the prudence of balloting on industrial action when an oversight body is to consider the matter.  The appropriate thing to do would be to let the oversight body do its job and see what it has to say.<\/p> <p>  I must also make the point that in recent days the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform commented on the cost of funding the claim put forward by the INMO, which it costed at &euro;300 million annually.  We are talking about a sizable sum.  If politicians wish to deviate from the public sector pay agreement, they ought to suggest how they will fund it because &euro;300 million is a substantial sum.  I hope that engagement can take place.  The oversight body is the appropriate body in which to do that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked the HSE to comment on home help and I am happy for it to do so.  However, from a policy perspective, the development of a statutory home care scheme is acutely needed on which we are all agreed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has done significant work with the Department on that.  We are again increasing funding for home help and we are not waiting until budget 2019 delivers a service plan, but will do it as part of our winter plans.

We have spoken about this before.  While the programme for partnership Government proposes that a new GP contract will be negotiated, this is not happening.  There is a huge manpower shortage in general practice as demonstrated by the fact that GPs are now closing their lists to new patients as the only way to control the amount of work they do.  There is new work coming their way, including new work being transferred from hospital services to general practice.  The many vacant posts in general practice are a further illustration of the manpower crisis.  There are not only vacancies in public GMS post contracts, but GPs are finding it difficult to recruit assistants and partners to their practices.  GPs are emigrating because of the quality of the service they are feeding into.  They cannot get access to services for their patients and have great difficulty getting access to diagnostics.  For all of those reasons, there is a huge manpower crisis.<\/p> <p>  The Government has chosen not to reverse the FEMPI legislation as it relates to GPs.  It has chosen instead to go down the route outlined this morning by the Minister involving sustainability, expansion of services and expansion of eligibility which might, at some future date, feed into the negotiations on a new GP contract.  I contend that negotiations on a new GP contract should run parallel to what the Government is doing.  I contend also that the Government should reverse the FEMPI legislation.  However, it has set its direction differently.  How can the Minister implement Sl&aacute;intecare, which is founded on the transfer of services from hospitals to primary and community care if the GP manpower required is not available?  The only way to get the necessary GP manpower is to develop a new contract.  Things can be added to the existing contract, which is the Government's current policy in adding new services and expanding eligibility, but it cannot be done without expanding the manpower in general practice.  The only way to do that is a new GP contract.  When is the Minister going to start negotiations on a new GP contract?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#V02600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  We have discussed this a great deal.  Every element of what we are engaging on with the IMO on now is pointed towards Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is the singular test in all of the asks we on the State side have in the engagement with GPs.  I do not wish to negotiate in public.  I would be in awful trouble if I did.  When I talk about sustainability measures, I am talking about making general practice sustainable so that it can deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am talking about ensuring there will be enough GPs who feel theirs is a challenging but rewarding career in which they wish to continue.  Sustainability, which is one of the three elements of the current talks, refers exactly to what the Chairman says.  It is about how we ensure enough people come into and stay in general practice.  It is a key element.  The other elements are access at eligibility and chronic disease management and they are directly focused on delivering Sl&aacute;intecare by taking services which are currently provided in hospitals and providing them in the community through general practice.<\/p><p>On eligibility, we must recognise that if we do not support general practice they cannot do this, but if we do not do this we will end up in a situation whereby people continue to end up in the hospital setting far too late in the development of their illness because cost might have been a barrier within primary care.  We saw the recent report on primary care, the lack of universal access here and how that compares unfavourably with other countries.<\/p><p> While we will not have a big-bang new contract - and I accept that assertion that the Chairman is making - we will have a framework that will deliver a number of new and exciting services, but will also invest in general practice, recognising that it needs to be sustainable.  The Chairman did not say this but I hear others say that all of the money that the Government wants to invest in general practice is for new services and that is not right.  As a Government, we recognise that before people are asked to take on new services, which the Chairman and I know that GPs want to take on if they are supported in doing so, we have to make sure that the current service is sustainable.  I accept that after years of FEMPI cuts, we have come to a position where general practice needs support to stabilise it.<\/p><p> I concede that there will not be a big bang contract moment by the end of the year.  However, there will be significant investment in general practice and a multi-annual framework for that investment and for the roll-out of services.  That framework will help us to continue to develop, evolve and modernise the GP contract.  This is a period of four years that we are discussing.  I cannot go too far on this in public but we are also trying to make sure that we do not conclude these talks at Christmas and say \"that is it, we are done, we have delivered a GP contract or reformed it.\"  It should be part of an evolution and there will be more issues we want to talk about and more changes we want to bring about in the future.  It is about getting a framework in place and when members of the committee see what we are trying to do, subject to us getting agreement, they will see much in it that they will like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#V02700","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":585,"content":"<p>The point I am making is that if the Minister is building upon the foundation of a contract that is 45 years old, that may make some practices sustainable and allow them to continue to operate but it will not attract any new GPs into the service because the fundamental basis on which the contract is built on is out of date.

I have spent more time with him in the last week than I have with my husband so the Minister might get tongues wagging.  I apologise if some of these points have been covered already but I had to go on the plinth earlier.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister to comment on the Ombudsman's comments this morning on the Learning to Get Better report and the recommendations not being implemented.  As the Minister knows, the HSE accepted 36 recommendations, fully implemented ten, partially implemented 17 and the other nine recommendations were either not implemented or are still being considered.<\/p> <p>  Is there any update on Respreeza?<\/p> <p>  I know that FreeStyle Libre has come up many times before but I have been contacted by people a lot more in recent times on this issue than previously.  If this was reimbursed it would change these people's lives.  Obviously none of us would like to be pricking our finger every day.  Sometimes people must do it up to ten times per day and it is causing much pain.  It would make a difference to these 20,000 adults and it would not be a huge financial cost so I recommend that they be looked after.  I know that four to 21 year olds are covered but when a person reaches 21 years of age will they continue to be covered into the future?  That would be good because obviously then everybody would eventually be covered but at the moment many people are enduring much pain every day.<\/p> <p>  While I know this is the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, unfortunately he is not here today.  I highlight the waiting list for the assessment of need and after that there is also still a large waiting list for the therapies that are recommended in the assessment.  For some reason, Cork seems to be particularly badly hit.  We are finding it hard to get to the cause of that but I highlight the seriousness of that to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018111400002#W00400","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I will share out the questions but I will take two of them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right to highlight the issue of the assessment of need waiting lists and I know she has been highlighting it for quite a period of time.  Ms Anne O'Connor might add further detail but from my perspective, the fact that following negotiation and engagement with Fianna F&aacute;il we have allocated funding for 100 additional therapy posts in 2019, along with some of the work the HSE is doing in reforming the assessment of need processes, will make a real and meaningful difference.  We will obviously be cognisant of allocating them to areas of particular and specific need through the service planning process.  I will not carry out the service plan here but it will obviously look at areas where there are particular acute problems and the Deputy has referenced the area of Cork.  That will be factored in as we work out where to allocate those 100 additional therapy posts in 2019.<\/p> <p>  On Respreeza, I am glad the Deputy brought it up.  Deputy Kelly also brought it up before I arrived and I caught a little bit of what he said.  There are two issues here.  There is the issue of the general reimbursement of the drug, which I will put to one side because it is a matter for the drug company to put in an application and go through the legal reimbursement process for which the HSE has responsibility.  There is another issue that is more acute in my view and is also more of an ethical issue, namely, that there are about 19 patients who are on what was in my view a long-term compassionate access clinical trial-type programme.  That support was pulled from them very quickly.  It was not handled very well by the company and it knows my views on that.  The HSE has been engaging intensively to try to provide a certainty for those 19 people and I am confident that in the next few days the HSE will bring that to a conclusion and I thank the executive for the hard work it has been doing on that.  It has also taken the unusual but appropriate step of providing some of the cost of administering the drug through nurses and the likes in the interim period.  I am hopeful for a resolution for those 19 people in the coming days and I emphasise the word \"days.\"<\/p> <p>  On FreeStyle Libre, as is a matter for the HSE's reimbursement process, its representatives might wish to comment but as the Deputy rightly says, it is available to children in hospitals at the moment.  It is about six months of the way through a 12-month evaluation process so if we do not have the information here we may come back to the Deputy with a note.  A parliamentary question tabled on it is down to be answered today as well.<\/p> <p>  On the Ombudsman, it is appropriate that the director general would respond as it was a report to the HSE.  Like the Deputy, I noted that there were a number of areas where the Ombudsman welcomed significant progress and others where there is still work to do.

As well as pursuing some of the process issues that have been outlined in this latest report, we should also have an ambition to do something to get more upstream of complaints, that is, to stop a complaint happening before it actually turns into something more serious.

Working with the Ombudsman, we developed an e-learning framework to help those who are managing complaints in our community healthcare organisations and hospital groups to manage them more effectively, supporting patients as service users and our staff who are supposed to be listening and responding to complaints.

The number of applications is 700 lower than last year and we expect that figure to increase to approximately 900 by the end of the year.

We looked at a couple of key issues.  In terms of capacity and improvement, in the first half of this year we were focused on developing a three-year plan which would look at improving capacity.  As Deputy Murphy O'Mahony stated, we should not be surprised by winter because we know it is coming every year.  We have to look at how we can develop our capacity in line with that and improve our services.  We have an improvement initiative, the Five Fundamentals, that has been peer reviewed and piloted in the south.  That work has been taking place all year and it led us into September.<\/p> <p>  Another important learning point for us this year was the papal visit.  We examined that in terms of what worked in terms of our response.  That has led us into a slightly different approach this year.  We are working with colleagues around the country who have emergency management experience on national and local co-ordination teams and we are looking at how we can maximise what we have available to us.  As I stated, we have not published the report.  We are in discussions with the Department.  Those discussions have pretty much concluded in terms of our approach and agreement around how we are doing this. However, that has not prevented us from starting the work.  We have been engaging with services since September.  We have integrated plans from all areas and we have agreed a plan.  We are now finalising the areas for investment but many detailed discussions have been going on with services all around the country.<\/p> <p>  Our challenge and focus has been on ensuring an integrated pathway for people throughout winter that begins in primary care and tries to keep as many people away from emergency departments as possible.

Given we are at times challenged to staff the space we have open all of the time, if we add more into the mix, it can create challenges.<\/p> <p>  I note the Deputy's point on home care.

It wrote a letter on 30 September and received a reply on 31 October from the co-chair of the management team advising that its proposals and engagement would be discussed at the meeting in November.  I understand that meeting is set for 26 November next.  One of the issues Nursing Homes Ireland has raised with me - it says this happens every year - is that from 22 December until approximately the third week in January, it has very little engagement with the HSE as regards working with it and helping to relieve the numbers coming out of the hospitals.  It is concerned that it has not been involved in the engagement to date on the winter plan and it is very anxious to be available and to work with the HSE so any issue in regard to numbers in hospitals can be dealt with in an expeditious manner.  I would appreciate any comment on that.  Nursing Homes Ireland certainly wants to work with the HSE in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is the consultant contract and, in particular, trying to make it attractive for people to return to Ireland.  I accept that we have discussed the consultant contract a few times today.

I look forward to the engagement between Nursing Homes Ireland and the HSE.<\/p> <p>  There are two parts to the answer to the question on consultants.  The first involves what I outlined to Deputy Donnelly earlier, namely, that the Public Service Pay Commission suggests that a process on the issue of new entrant pay should be considered at a particular point.  My Department will consider how best to advance that matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The second point is that we also have the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir's group is carrying out a major examination of decoupling private practice in public hospitals in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  At a certain point, this will require contractual engagement with consultants.  There is the monetary piece from the Public Service Pay Commission.

These practices are being heavily advertised in Ireland and there has been considerable growth.  In the UK, it was discovered that four in ten were unsafe or there were fears about their safety.

I joined the NTMA in August of this year.<br\/><br\/>I am accompanied this morning by Paul O&rsquo;Neill, who is a finance sector head at the NDFA and has responsibility for a number of the sectors including housing.<br\/><br\/>The NDFA is the statutory financial adviser to State bodies in respect of all public capital investment projects of scale.  In our advisory role, the NDFA provides a number of services including financial robustness testing, tender assessment and advice on optimum forms of funding.  The NDFA also has a broader responsibility for the procurement and delivery of PPP projects other than those in the transport sector.  We have a mix of skill sets within the team ranging from financial advisory, to construction, engineering, design and project management.  We have built up significant experience over the past 15 years across a range of large-scale infrastructure projects in education, justice, health, tourism, transport and energy.  In addition to project delivery, we also have an active role in monitoring the operations of a significant number of PPP schemes in the State.<br\/><br\/>The committee has asked me to focus on three topics relating to social housing delivery: public private partnerships, PPPs; land initiatives; and enhanced leasing.  <br\/><br\/>On the first of these, PPPs, our role is extensive and includes assisting the Department and the relevant local authorities with planning, design, risk transfer, procurement and delivery.  From the moment the projects are handed over to us by the Secretary General of the Department, we are formally accountable to procure these projects within a defined set of parameters, including budgetary and technical specifications.  Upon completion of construction, the projects are then formally handed back to the Department and-or local authorities.  I should say at the outset that the NDFA has a limited role in respect of the second and third topics that the committee has asked us to comment on, namely land initiatives and enhanced leasing.  I will explain this later but will first focus on PPPs.  The Government has approved three social housing schemes which will provide approximately 1,500 homes.  Two of the three schemes under this initiative are in procurement.  <br\/><br\/>The first scheme, social housing bundle 1, is being co-ordinated by Dublin City Council on behalf of five local authorities, and comprises six sites across counties Louth, Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  In total, this scheme - a summary of which is included in the slides of the supporting document submitted to the Committee - encompasses 534 homes for social housing.  By way of update, following a competitive tender process, a preferred bidder for this scheme, named Comhar, was selected in September 2018 and comprises a consortium of the following companies: Sisk Construction, which will be primarily responsible for the construction work; Oaklee and Choice Housing, which will be responsible for tenancy management and maintaining the homes over the life of the scheme, being 25 years post construction; Macquarie, which is involved as an independent provider of equity to the project; and the debt providers which are expected to include the European Investment Bank and Bank of Ireland.  As is normal in a PPP structure, the State is not required to pay any moneys during construction.  When the homes are delivered and made available to the intended beneficiaries, then the State will make monthly unitary payments over the 25 year life of the project to pay for the upfront cost of the assets and for the ongoing maintenance.  At the end of the 25 year contract, the State fully owns these social homes.  Construction is expected to begin on this scheme in the first quarter of 2019 with all homes to be completed in 2020.<br\/><br\/>The second scheme, social housing bundle 2, is currently being tendered with fully costed bids due to be received on 1 February 2019.  There are four bidders in this process: the three bidders from the first scheme and one additional consortium.  As for bundle 1, all bidding consortia include a mixture of experienced contractors and approved housing bodies.  This scheme is being co-ordinated by Cork County Council and involves eight sites across the six counties of Cork, Galway, Clare, Waterford, Roscommon and Kildare.  In total this scheme involves 465 homes for social housing.  We anticipate that construction will commence in the third quarter of 2019 and all homes will be completed by 2021.<br\/><br\/>The third scheme, social housing bundle 3, is at pre-procurement.  In September, the Department identified a Long List of 14 potential sites.  The NDFA has completed a high-level technical suitability assessment of these sites.  Once the list is finalised by the Department in consultation with the local authorities, the NDFA, along the other partners, will become engaged to help drive design, planning, procurement and delivery.<br\/><br\/>I have provided more detailed information in the supporting documentation on the timelines for bundles 1 and 2.  As with any large scale public infrastructure, the timelines are considerable.  The main reasons for this are that the process of selecting sites and bringing them through site preparation, design and planning takes a significant period of time.  The public procurement process, which can only commence once these processes are completed, also has set timelines which must be adhered to, both for legal reasons and in order to ensure robust competitive proposals are obtained.<font color=\"#FFFFFF\">End<\/font><\/p><p> Equally relevant is that this is the first time the Department and local authorities have been involved in PPPs in the housing sector which has involved significant upfront work by all parties.  However, there is now a good framework in place and in the short term we expect it to create efficiencies in the third bundle and future delivery.  In the longer term this new channel for procuring social housing could run alongside other methods of delivery and provide additionality, something that has not been available to us in the past decade. <\/p><p> I am aware of the ongoing debate about PPPs and value for money.  The submission of robust competitive proposals is paramount in ensuring value for money is delivered to the taxpayer.  Like all PPPs, the NDFA procures on behalf of State bodies and follows Department of Finance and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on value for money.  The private sector tenders must demonstrate value for money against the public sector benchmark, being the estimated cost of undertaking the project in question on a traditional basis.  The guidelines are being followed in the social housing PPP programme.  Best practice and current practice is to disclose further details of value for money at the appropriate time following contract award.  This has happened across the education and transport sectors, as it will in the case of social housing. <\/p><p> The NDFA is working in an advisory capacity with various local authorities throughout the country to assist them in procuring mixed tenure developments on sites that they own.  Our primary role is to provide advice on financial matters and tender assessment.  Local authorities identify suitable sites and specify the tenure mix they require, that is, the breakdown between social, affordable and private homes.  They go to tender in seeking bids for the delivery of housing based on the tenure mix specified.  At the end of construction, the social houses are owned by the local authorities.  A list of schemes on which we are assisting is included in slide No. 4 in the supporting documentation.  The most progressed of the schemes is in Kilcarbery in south county Dublin.  South Dublin County Council has selected a preferred tenderer and expects to sign a development agreement with this party in the next two months.  Once the development agreement is signed, the preferred tenderer will apply for planning permission.  Under the scheme it is envisaged to provide 975 homes, of which 30% will be social housing.  On the basis of sites of which we are aware, the land initiative scheme has the potential to cumulatively deliver 6,500 new homes, of which approximately 1,500 will be social housing.  However, it should be noted that all of the schemes still require planning permission and financing. <\/p><p> As mentioned, the role of the NDFA in enhanced leasing is limited.  Our involvement to date has primarily been in obtaining market soundings on behalf of the Department and providing advice on the form of the lease to be offered.  The scheme is being administered by the Housing Agency on behalf of the Department.  The Housing Agency is responsible for the evaluation of submissions, selection of candidates and evaluation of market rents in conjunction with the local authorities.  Our primary role in social housing provision is in respect of the three PPP bundles, with the first of the schemes expected to start construction in the first quarter of 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Bryce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bryce.

I am the director general of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, a professional body which represents more than 5,000 members in the property, construction and land sectors in Ireland.  I am joined by fellow chartered surveyor Mr. Michael Cleary who works in private practice, specialising in planning and asset and development management.  He co-authored the society&rsquo;s recent report, Real Cost of New Apartment Delivery, and previously served as chairman of our planning and development committee.<br\/><br\/>There are many elements to this discussion, but for the proposes of this opening statement, we will focus on how improvements could be made to increase the delivery of social housing by unlocking the value and benefits of collaborating with the private sector.  Last year the SCSI prepared a report entitled<i>, <\/i>Real Cost of New Apartment Delivery, which followed on from an earlier report entitled, Real Cost of New House Delivery<i>. <\/i>The findings in both reports suggest land and financing costs are crucial market obstacles in the development of apartment and housing schemes aimed at delivering affordable accommodation.  The apartment costs report, in particular, report shows that costs can vary from &euro;293,000 for a low rise suburban Dublin apartment to &euro;578,000 for a medium rise apartment in Dublin city.  Site costs outlined in the report which is now somewhat dated vary from &euro;33,000 per site unit to &euro;125,000.  It can be difficult to justify paying such high land costs in a market with viability challenges.  However, it is well accepted that the high price paid for development land is a symptom of a market starved of well located and serviced development land opportunities. <br\/><br\/>In considering the finance impact on development, it is perhaps not surprising that the Viennese housing model which has been highlighted as a good one by other bodies is successful in having private developers assist with social housing delivery programmes.  The Vienna housing fund, Wohnfonds Wien, attracts developers by providing very low interest funding, currently 1% for 30 years, and actively managing the very limited land available in the city.  Developers make a profit, but with these elements essentially de-risked, the necessary market returns from investments can be lower.  It is essential that the industry as a whole, both private and public, work together to seek to improve the shared approach to the solving the housing challenge. <br\/><br\/>In the context of social housing procured by local authorities, as we are all aware, time delays can have significant repercussions for costs and, ultimately, the overall housing output.  It is not uncommon, whether because of procurement issues or planning and construction problems, for significant delays of between 12 and 18 months to arise.  The average housing development can often lose a monetary value of 10% to 15% of its units because of such delays.  The impact of unforeseen issues can be very costly.  <br\/><br\/>PPPs can be a useful tool for risk and gain sharing.  When used properly, they are a good mechanism for releasing public assets to be developed in collaboration with the private sector, with the private sector providing risk capital, as well as know-how, and the public entity providing the land.  Cities that are addressing their housing needs well are doing so by learning from long experience.  There should be a review of the lessons learned from residential projects that did not deliver the housing mix originally envisaged.  This needs to be fostered across all stakeholders.  It will present an opportunity for the newly established Land Development Agency to engage with sectoral expertise to provide best practice guidance and support in PPP schemes and complex proposals where the critical scheme promoter role is key to a successful outcome.  <br\/><br\/>It is important to support public sector delivery as the use of Part V, while effective in delivering social units in the boom years, led to the privatisation of the knowledge, skills and infrastructure required to deliver social housing.  This has created a skills gap in the public sector, but as internal professional resources are being developed again, there is a real opportunity for local authorities to enhance their project knowledge by taking on the developer\/promoter role for social and affordable housing projects.  These skills will be critically important in times of reduced private supply, as an anti-cyclical counterweight when public housing needs increase.<br\/><br\/>Ireland also needs to de-risk its housing policies by supporting a range of public, private and not-for-profit entities to bring more supply to the market.  To achieve a more robust delivery system, many development entities should be encouraged to take part, including private, for-profit organisations, as well as not-for-profit endeavours that meet set criteria in terms of scale and expertise.  The approved housing body sector should be encouraged to deliver units that can be maintained in public ownership in the long term.  These schemes should focus on cost rental and social rental funding models. <br\/><br\/>The Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, is welcomed by the industry and developers.  The Land Development Agency could prove to be a significant catalyst in freeing up the planning and infrastructure risks and making more State land ready for the PPP process.  The agency could also be used to strategically streamline the procurement routes for residential projects.  Its aim should be to become the specialist in this area and be a key resource for all State bodies and local authorities tasked with delivering the very ambitious national development plan and, in particular, the supply of public housing. <br\/><br\/>The SCSI has been supportive of the announcement that local authorities will once again return to the direct construction of homes.  They must be properly resourced, with access to the right skill sets, professional knowledge and expertise in ordfer that they can put together the best social housing solutions without undue cost or delay.  <br\/><br\/>We look forward to discussing this subject in more detail with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I have a question for Ms Bryce on public private partnerships, PPPs.

The contractor bids in the value of the cost of building the social units.  That is then the payment from the local authority to the contractor.  Separately, the contractor also bids in a land contribution payment which it proposes to make to the council in return for the residual land.  They are both separate payments.  In land swap deals in the past, the payments were more aligned or linked to each other, and when the land values at the time decreased, it had implications for those projects.

One of the things we would say, in general, in respect of social housing is that stop-start is very difficult.  That is also the case in regard to PPPs.  If we were to do these first three bundles and then stop, it would take a great deal of effort to start again.  It is the same with the local authorities and skill sets.  It is important to try to keep some continuity in all of the channels, if at all possible.  The local authorities are building up their skill sets.  We have worked, or I should say that the team has worked, as I am relatively newly joined, with great people in the local authorities on developing these PPP schemes.  We would certainly like to keep that continuity of experience now that it has been acquired after an amount of hard grafting, if I can put it that way.  It is a challenge, overall, for the industry because we are suddenly into this upsurge of construction in all areas and not just in social housing.  I refer to housing in general, offices schemes etc.  My colleagues might comment on that further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Bryce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>That is correct.  As a practitioner, I have been involved for about 25 years on delivering on planning and development.  We have been involved as development managers at the coalface with the good, the bad and the ugly, and the good again.  I have some direct experience of this.  I have a couple of points to make.  One is similar to the point made by Ms Bryce, and that is that the delivery mechanisms are very difficult to get up and going again.  For ten years the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, led the way in trying to revitalise the industry overall.  It took some years to get even commercial projects up and running.  Residential projects, by their nature, are much more complex because they involve dealing with individuals as well as all of us here, and trying to satisfy a market need that is both social and affordable.  We did not mention that here but it is very important.<\/p> <p>  The two issues on planning and development in the delivery process are the planning mix and the tenure.  I refer to who is going to own the end product.  We are all of the time trying to work to that.  There is also a constraint in regard to what can be financed.  Those are competing issues.  The NDFA has set out a process and that is starting to work and deliver now from a standing start.  The private sector also has a part to play here.  In some of those initiatives, such as Kilcarbery and those undertaken by other local authorities, the local authorities themselves have upskilled.  They now have the necessary people in place to deliver on those initiatives.  As someone who has been doing this for about 25 years, we need to look beyond the immediate issue.  It is an important issue and all of the evidence is there to support the fact that we need to address it.  We do, however, also need to think beyond that so that we do not get caught in this scenario again.<\/p> <p>  Since 2011 or 2012, the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland has been trying to promote some kind of an entity that would act like, for example, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, originally the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  I refer to some entity on a national scale that would keep an eye on the future in respect of what should happen with its remit.  The remit for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was the redevelopment of the docklands area.  It had a bad experience near the end of its shelf life but it was quite good up to then.  We need something similar at this stage and we welcome the Land Development Agency.  We have not seen fully what its remit is.  I am talking about anything, however, that can add to the knowledge base, strategically pick out sites that need to be delivered, remove the planning issues around that - those that private sector will not or cannot take the risk on - and deliver on infrastructure such as sewerage, power and all of those things.<\/p> <p>  I refer to having sites shovel-ready so that when the private sector comes, and that will either be through the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, process as outlined or through some other process, they have been de-risked.  It would also be important that an eye be kept on the use mix because the type of mix is important.  Our experience in projects in which we have been involved, which we will not mention here, includes seeing projects 15 to 20 years ago that did not even make the headlines.  They started out with the best of intent by local authorities.  We went through the process, we lived it and we all thought that we did the right thing.  Last week, or the week before, I drove by one and brought kids in around it.  I told them that we all thought we were going to do something great there but that it had not worked out.  Those are the lessons to be learned.  That kind of corporate knowledge needs to be provided to something like the Land Development Agency - I just picked that as an example - so that it can be handed down.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the point is the anti-cyclical aspect.  Much of finance is based on there being some kind of consistent profit or return to pay for the input.  A consistent level of output, therefore, is needed to provide the housing in the locations where it is needed.  This goes back to the NDFA's point as well.  It takes a long time to put these skill sets in place and, when they are in place, there should be encouragement to perform.  They should be analysed and brought in front of committees like this regularly to see how they are performing.  They should also be tweaked as needs be, but only in a small way and over a long duration because the arc of delivery on housing is ten, 15 or 20 years.  We believe strongly that a forward plan is needed and that it needs to be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cleary"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bryce for her opening presentation.  She spoke a great deal about the regeneration PPPs.<\/p><p>I will refer to the Scribblestown scheme in Finglas which is to start before Christmas.  As far as I am aware, it is 100% social housing.  During the years the reputation of PPPs has not been great in terms of delivery and how they have been operated.  I am trying to figure out how this one will be much better than previous PPPs.  On some of them the sod has been turned about six times.  I find it frustrating that it takes so long.  The pulling together of public and private has been a major problem.  I am told by management of Dublin City Council that the Scribblestown scheme should start before Christmas, but I suspect it will probably be in the new year.<\/p><p> Many of the PPPs are managed by voluntary housing bodies such as Oaklee Housing and Choice Housing.  I have always been a great believer in local authorities building more.  It is a much more straightforward mechanism in terms of delivery for them to have their own companies build or to employ private firms to build for them.  They could deliver a lot more.  <\/p><p> That brings me to what is planned for Coultry in Ballymun.  It is planned to provide 400 units there in what is called a cost rental scheme.  From my conversations with Dublin City Council, it is talking about the cost being &euro;1,000 a month or thereabouts.  We know that in the general area of Ballymun it would probably be &euro;1,500 or &euro;1,600.  I am not sure about the value in terms of cost rental on this site because the land is being given over, but various figures for land prices have been given, including &euro;33,000 and &euro;50,000.  I much prefer to see local authorities building social and affordable housing, rather than going down the road of PPPs.

What we find in project management with our quantity surveyor colleagues who were involved in the provision of the report with the planning and development surveyors is that the cost of delivery of suburban low rise apartments is very different because they are the closest to standard residential construction.  The issue arises because it is taken out of that sector and brought into constrained sites such as city centre sites.  The regulatory system for the development of apartments is significantly different from that for housing once they go above three storeys.  The building is done in a very different way.  There are significant fire safety regulations required to be met.  There is a significant amount of common area space which is not present in houses because everything inside the four walls of a house is owned and occupied.  There are significant additional regulatory factors in the delivery of medium rise apartments, including the cost of land and finance.  One apartment cannot be sold as soon as the ground floor apartment is finished.  The entire block has to be held and finished satisfactorily before anything can be sold in a scheme.  The finance costs in developing apartment blocks are considerably different from those in developing housing.  When the first house is topped out and the site works around it are finished, it can potentially be sold to fund the next phase of a scheme.  Finance, land and regulatory frameworks have a very significant impact on the delivery of apartments compared with standard suburban models.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Effectively, Ms Myler is saying building low rise apartments blocks on greenfield sites will work out more cheaply.

It is usually procured if it is not publicly owned, if it privately owned, and usually bid for.  The capacity to bid and win land skews everything else.  One can quite readily measure the construction cost element.  Any good quantity surveyor, whether it be a social apartment, in respect of which there is full transparency on the cost of construction, or a private apartment, can quickly tell what the cost of the lift, the lights and every other element will be.  <\/p> <p>  There are a number of reasons it is expensive in Ireland.  Some relate to the technical issues, to which Ms Myler alluded, such as basement car parking spaces and so on.  <\/p> <p>  I refer to the number of apartments that must be put off a core.  The placing of more apartments off a core, in other words, off a lift shaft or stairwell, is helpful.  I refer also to the number of single or dual aspect apartments.  In other countries, for example, the ones to which the Senator referred, there are single aspect apartments, which means that one can fit more apartments around the core with a singular aspect.  Does this make it a better or worse apartment?  That is for someone else to decide, but it is a way to reduce costs.  <\/p> <p>  The third part is the cost of finance, which goes back to the Viennese housing model, to which we referred.  The Dutch also have such a model.  It is a matter of being able to de-risk the process, which is the point we have been emphasising all along, and provide land with planning permission, with what we said the Land Development Agency could do.  You are telling someone, \"I need you to produce and deliver X number of housing or apartment units.\"  The finance costs would then be really cheap because the risk level would have dropped all the way as one would have removed the infrastructure and planning risks and de-risked the process.  <\/p> <p>  Going back to a point raised I think by Senator Grace O'Sullivan, in 1993, on my second day in the job, I was with a developer who received a list of quantities and threw it across the room, saying, \"I cannot believe apartments are that expensive to build in Ireland.\"  I was not a grey-haired quantity surveyor at the time, but I said the reason that was the way it was was that one of the issues was that Ireland was an island and, unfortunately, the transfer of labour and the procurement of all of these goods - the other part of this - had to take place from somewhere else.  Working in Holland or elsewhere on mainland Europe was incredible in that regard.  During the downturn we did a lot of work in London and Germany and it was incredible how they sourced their equipment and inputs from various places.  They were able to move them across overnight.  It takes an age to get them to Ireland.  Therefore, there are a variety of factors at play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cleary"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  As I was watching the proceedings on the monitor earlier, I caught their earlier contributions.  It would take a lot on their part to convince me that there was a point in even looking at public private partnerships.  Will they explain to me how under any circumstance it could be cheaper, faster and more efficient to go through what seems inevitably to be a more complex and cumbersome process in which we must involve private sector actors and their concerns about risk, the market and so on and essentially pander to them and de-risk things for them?  Is it the job of the State to de-risk things for the private sector, as opposed to using our own money to build on land we own, taking out site costs or whatever one calls them, to <\/p> <p>provide houses at the cost needed, getting architects in to design them, putting infrastructure in place and then getting brickies, carpenters, electricians and the rest to go in and put them up?  A building worker will say that if the basics are done, a house will be built in six weeks.  Therefore, I do not understand how this just goes on and on.<\/p> <p>  In that regard, I would like to ask about a specific site in Shanganagh.  I understand various options being discussed for the site have been referred to the National Development Finance Agency because, inexplicably in my opinion, the council is required to look at a PPP.  The elected councillors do not want one and I am absolutely certain the people of the area do not want one.  They want public and affordable housing for people who are on the waiting list and those who are above the income thresholds to be included in the list and who cannot afford to buy in the private market.  That is what they want.  They want to be able to rent or buy in the private market.  It seems that it is logically and obviously the case that it could be done as one big bundle.  The councils could put the infrastructure in place and design the stuff themselves.  Obviously, they can build at the lowest possible cost because they do not have to seek outside finance or borrow.  We could use the State's own money and not borrow.  There would be no risk involved because we know that there are plenty of people on the housing list to take the houses, as well as plenty of people who cannot buy in the private market and who would be jumping over one another to take a cost rental and affordable house.  Is there any case in which the model I am setting out would be less efficient than all of the PPPs, with all of their complexities and all of the other considerations that necessarily must be included?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#F00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Regarding the Shanganagh site-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Bryce"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":741,"content":"<p>If Deputy Boyd Barrett will allow it, I will take Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions because he has parliamentary questions tabled for oral reply.

While we have the Department's reports, it says something that it was the SCSI that produced the reports on houses and apartments well before any Government agency.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to have an ideological discussion with the NDFA on public private partnerships; I would like to get some facts.  One of the great tragedies is that while the presentations are very useful, they do not give us the facts we need as a committee to try to answer some of the very legitimate questions raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Part of the problem is the great mysterious thing called the public sector benchmark.  The way in which this exercise takes place is that qualified officials from the Department and local authorities in the case of the PPP bundles determine what it would cost the public sector to do this work.  It is then locked away in secret and neither elected members of councils nor the Oireachtas is allowed to see it, but when tenders come in, they are compared against it to see whether we are getting value for money.  My concern is that until I see how the NDFA does it, I am not convinced it can capture the reality of what happens.  <\/p> <p>  If I am tendering for a PPP bundle such as bundle one, I must look at what it would cost to build, that is, labour and materials.  I must bring my own finance, which is probably more expensive than public sector finance from the Housing Finance Agency or other sources.  I must factor in maintenance costs of the property over a 25-year period, which is a tricky business.   There is, therefore, an element of risk which is factored into the costs.  I must then make my premium.  <\/p> <p>  Anyone who knows anything about local authority delivery of housing knows that at no stage does it secure full cost recovery of the unit over 25 years.  It does not, for example, receive a monthly payment from anyone that covers the cost of building, finance, management and maintenance and it certainly does not receive a premium.  One of the reasons the social housing stock is in urgent need of regeneration after about 25 or 30 years is that the public sector does not have these availability agreements.  How much detailed information can the NDFA give us, for example, on the public sector benchmark for the first bundle of 500 PPPs?<\/p><p>How can the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, assure us, in the absence of being able to see that comparison ourselves, that we are really comparing like with like in the benchmarking exercise?  Can the witnesses tell us the cost per unit of that first 500 bundle?  The reason I am asking that is, even on the construction end, we know the average cost according to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for social housing output at the moment is &euro;200,000.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a slightly different figure of &euro;216,000.  Local elected councillors are being asked to approve planning permissions and Oireachtas Members are being asked to consent to this without knowing the actual cost.  When we asked for those costs before the first tender was awarded, we were told we could not have them for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  I assume we can now have the bundle 1 cost, or is that still a problem?  Can the National Development Finance Agency respond on that?<\/p><p> If the witnesses cannot give us the cost, or the unit cost, can they at least confirm some of the additional costs that the private sector requires to cover the additional cost of finance and the risk factor in terms of projecting maintenance cost and the additional premium?  Of course that means it will be more expensive.  Can the witnesses at least tell us it is not like for like and there are additional costs there?<\/p><p> I have two other concerns.  The NDFA gave us two slides, which are very helpful, and they show that, from conception to tenanting, it is a four-year process.  Local authorities are bad but they are nowhere near that bad.  It is now down to about two to two and a half years from conception to tenanting.  The NTMA has lots of experience of PPPs in other Government sectors, whether with water or schools or whatever, so is this always going to be four years?  Can this be reduced?  When will it be reduced?  We are all putting lots of pressure on the Department on Housing, Planning and Local Government and the local authorities to reduce their 12 to 18-month approval and tendering process below that.<\/p><p> Then there are the contractual issues.  These are 25-year contractual arrangements.  They are very complex legal agreements.  There is substantial evidence from Britain about how the use of these complex contracts for urban regeneration and social housing has led to lots of difficulties, as we have seen with Carillion and the beginnings of that here.  How does the NDFA's model factor in those less tangible risks and can it convince us that it has done any learning from the failure of many of these public private partnerships and regeneration projects in Britain, which have ended up costing the taxpayer substantially more than was originally agreed?<\/p><p> I have a brief question for the chartered surveyors.  One of the really interesting things that emerged from the Department and Housing Agency reports, which came after the report of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, is that, on the one hand, the Housing Agency report tell us that the cost of construction is about in line with European norms, which is a really useful bit of data to get.  On the other hand, the Department's report confirmed my reading of the chartered surveyors' reports, particularly the apartment reports, that it is simply not possible, given the all-in development costs that we have just outlined, for the private sector to deliver houses, but particularly apartments, for people on incomes up to &euro;75,000, in line with the Central Bank's mortgage lending rules.  Do the witnesses agree with that analysis?  Am I wrong in that?  Is that what the facts tell us?  If so, do we have to start relying less on the private sector, with all of those complex costs, to deliver housing for that sector of workers?  Does the chartered surveyors' research and the two Government reports, that I am sure they have studied, make the case that, for affordable housing for modest income families, it is a public sector-led model, whatever about who is involved, that will really deliver housing for working families within that income bracket?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#F00800","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":745,"content":"<p>There is quite a number of questions there.  I will try to cover as many as possible.  The Deputies have made very fair comments about the PPPs and timelines.  I would say that, because applying PPPs to social housing was new, the local authorities, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and ourselves had to spend a lot of time trying to really specify what we were looking for the private sector to do.  That collaboration has been very positive but it was time consuming.<\/p> <p>  I believe that some efficiencies can be obtained in bundle 3.  I will not pretend that bundle 3 will be a quick process because a lot of time is required for the design, planning and procurement and there is not much one can do to shorten those timelines.  Bundles 1 and 2 have been longer because, in both cases, we were working with different local authorities.  Bundle 2 is being managed by Cork County Council and bundle 1 by Dublin City Council so it was new for all of those local authorities.<\/p> <p>  The collaboration has been very helpful and one of the benefits that PPP provides is that it encourages the parties from the service element and construction element to get together upfront to try to work at designing good schemes.  That is perhaps something that does not happen with the slightly more disjointed building upfront and then servicing in some of the other channels.<\/p> <p>  There is a very rigid and detailed process that we go through in relation to the public sector benchmark and these are all following the guidelines as laid down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  First of all, there is an independent cost assessor who costs out the full construction cost and service element of the scheme.  Those costs are reviewed in conjunction with the National Development Finance Agency, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and members of each of the local authorities were involved in assessing those costs.  They are done upfront, so they are not done in retrospect after bids are received.  One of the most important things is that there is competition in the bidding and that is essential and there was good competitive tension between three very well thought-out bids in social housing 1 and four now happening in social housing 2.<\/p> <p>  The winning bid is compared with the public sector benchmark and I am, unfortunately, not able to give a cost per unit because we are in a live procurement.  I am not able to give you the public sector benchmark now, but it will be published.  I am able to confirm that the preferred tender did come in below the public sector benchmark.<\/p> <p>  The NDFA would like to speak to the experience of PPPs in this country across education, transport, justice and health cohorts more recently.  First of all, procuring any infrastructure has challenges.  There is nothing easy in trying to do large-scale infrastructure and I think we would see, both across traditional procurement and PPPs, issues arise, for example in relation to Carillion and the default there.  The construction sector is a risky one, it is fair to say.  In terms of the overall experience as to whether risk has been transferred, we have pretty good experience of risk being successfully transferred and that really gives us confidence to believe it will work for the social housing schemes.  <\/p> <p>  There is no one channel that is perfect.  Every channel of delivery, as I see it, has its pros and cons.  The land initiatives have pros and cons.  PPPs have pros and cons and issues can emerge even for the local authorities doing these projects by themselves.<\/p> <p>  To address Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions about risk and sharing, there is only one risk and the question is who bears it.  With PPPs, we work hard to try to make the private sector take as much of the risk as possible.  There is no demand risk in PPP schemes for social housing so that is taken out of the picture.  These are all social houses on social land to stay within the remit of the State and for the State to have full control over who goes into those homes.<\/p><p>That is understood upfront.  There is no demand risk being transferred or shared and no pricing for that.  The risk that is borne by the private sector is the risk of construction and construction cost overruns.  In today's market that is quite significant, in particular with rising inflation in the construction sector.  The private sector also takes the risk of being able to maintain the houses over the 25 years, manage them appropriately, and to hand them back in a suitable condition.  They cost that risk and they bid on it and that is what we assess against the public sector benchmark.  I hope I have answered some of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Bryce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I want to address the question about direct provision.

As somebody who lived in social housing for most of my early years, up to the time I got married, I accept the point about the lack of repair and management of those schemes, probably due to lack of finance.  That is something that might be proposed by the Government in a direct provision model for social housing in the future.  It would have to be addressed to ensure the longevity of the stock.  I think that is perhaps addressed in the public private partnership, PPP, model, although there are concerns about the management of that, but at least there is a plan for the management of it, which is important.<\/p> <p>  We must recognise that we are in competition with the market for resources that are relatively scarce.

I do not see the logic, especially when Ms Bryce has more or less admitted that the PPP has a much longer timeline and that is because it is a more complicated process.  I do not see the advantage of it and even less so given the point made about competition between the public and private sectors.  There is limited capacity to build at the moment and I would have thought that the State must grab as much of that capacity as it possibly can, to produce affordable housing.  The obvious danger with the private providers seeking the highest possible return is that like lemmings they will all go running after the highest return and after a certain point, because they are all looking for the same highest return, there is an oversupply in one part of the market and a chronic undersupply in another part of the market.  There is some evidence that that is happening already.  Some builders are building homes that nobody could ever afford to buy, or very soon the limited market that could afford houses for &euro;800,000 or &euro;900,000 will run out and we will have houses that cost that amount sitting empty when that building capacity should have been used to build houses that cost &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 and social housing.  I know the NTMA witnesses cannot comment on the ideological debate but on a purely practical level, given the limited capacity they are talking about, I do not see why they would go for a more cumbersome complex process and want to include a sector that is taking risks, because given the urgency we cannot afford to take risks with limited capacity.<\/p> <p>  I have one last question which I did not ask in my initial contribution, on which I invite the NTMA witnesses to comment.

Does she have any idea what those efficiencies are?  I presume by efficiencies she means a reduction in timeline.<\/p> <p>  I do not think it is fair to say that there is nothing the NTMA can do about planning or procurement.  For example, Part 8 planning permissions are now the shortest planning permissions one will get following the legislative changes made when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, was Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Many Deputies and councillors work very hard to ensure Part 8s get through.  That is the case for even the very controversial Part 8s, such as the PPPs, which Deputy Ellis and I dealt with in our constituencies.  Even though we did not like the funding model, we still did everything we could to make sure they got through because we wanted to make sure the units were brought into stock.  Planning is not the problem here.<\/p> <p>  In terms of procurement, there is nothing to stop the Government allowing local authorities having regional framework agreements for build in the same way as they have for maintenance.  One might have to stagger those and have one framework agreement for builds below 20 units or below 50 units, for example, but that would significantly speed up the delivery of individual projects.  There would be a big tendering process at the start, every three years, but then one would not have to go out to tender for every single project.  If it makes sense to do that, as I think it does for maintenance contractors, it has to be within the remit of the local authorities and the NTMA to do that.  I think we could do an awful lot of speeding up in terms of procurement.<\/p> <p>  It concerns me what was said about good schemes.  In fact, all of the schemes I am looking at currently, irrespective of the delivery mechanism are of exceptionally high quality.  We have social housing developments that have been delivered through the more standard model that are exceptionally high so I do not understand how one can say that by involving people in the way a PPP does, that it delivers better quality schemes.  In fact, our experience from the collapse of previous PPPs suggests otherwise.<\/p> <p>  On benchmarking, my question is whether we are comparing a fictional cost of the full cost recovery of a local authority to deliver the units and maintain them over 25 years with the private sector bids or are we comparing the real world actual money a local authority gets for that, because they are two very different things.  Ms Myler's point is very well made.  I would like to believe Ms Bryce but I will have to wait to see the figures.  Even if she were my sister I would be saying the same thing.  I want to see the figures.  I cannot understand the approach, given the additional cost factors of the private sector, and that private developers will want full cost recovery plus a premium, and that the State does not get full cost recovery at all, let alone a premium.<\/p><p>The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, says it comes in below the benchmark but I suspect the benchmark does not reflect the reality of what local authorities get for building and maintenance over a 25-year period.  Any reassurance on that would be wonderful.  I am delighted the public sector benchmark is to be published.  It would be great if Ms Bryce could tell us when it will be published.  Our problem is that we are scrutinising the cost after the fact.  What we have seen in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and in a similar report on the use of public private partnerships for major infrastructural projects across the European Union, which was published earlier this year, is that when we finally get to scrutinise the cost after the fact, there are many additional costs which show that the PPP was not, in fact, more cost-effective.  With regard to the point on competition and bidding, that happens with every social housing project.  Given that every social housing project goes out to a competitive tendering process, I do not see how that works any differently.<\/p><p> A house is not a school.  This is one of the big things shown by the British experience.  People live in houses and them far more, which means depreciation, damage, repair and maintenance have a greater effect than they would on a school or water treatment plant.  Therefore, the possibility of maintenance costs fluctuating over the 25 years is far greater.  We also know that we have other problems with which we have to deal in some of our housing estates.  It is not that the experience of PPPs in other sectors is not relevant; of course it is.  I would hope, however, that Ms Bryce will accept that the nature of housing and the purposes for which it is used results in greater cost variations and risk factors which make a straight comparison with a school or water treatment plant difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#H00900","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I hope the Deputy's sister is not watching because she might be very disappointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#J00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":757,"content":"<p>She is upstairs.

Perhaps the Deputy's point is that effect could be multiplied in the case of social housing.  I take that point.  Much thought has gone into developing the community aspect of these schemes.  There are detailed requirements in the project agreement on helping tenants with energy management and setting up schemes with good community services, play environments and so on.  Much of that work is also done by the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  The collaboration between contractors and housing associations I spoke about mainly relates to long-term maintenance and building properties so that they will still be in good condition at the end of the 25 years and can continue to be used.  I take the Deputy's point that local authorities may not have been given sufficient money over the years to allow properties to be maintained on an ongoing basis.  That is not to say that those costs have not arisen.  The fact that the money is not spent potentially leads to greater issues down the line.  Perhaps the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland could comment further on this.  If something is left too long without maintenance, it requires significantly more money to refurbish it.  The Deputy spoke about the issues that arise in refurbishing houses.  The PPP model focuses the mind on the longer-term asset because it is a State asset at all times.  It is a State home on State land and the focus has been on trying to ensure these homes are still in good condition at the end of the contract period.<\/p> <p>  There are costs and risks.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke of taking on risks.  Once the State decides to build and maintain houses, schools or hospitals, risks arise.  It is not that anyone is taking on additional risks, it is just that risks are inherent in the projects.  The issue is to try to find the best ways of managing those risks.  We think it makes sense to ask the private sector to help manage some of those risks.  It helps to focus minds in the private sector on the longer-term assets rather than on just building things that will look fine for a number of years but which may not stand the test of time.  The PPP model attempts to do that and in that sense, I believe it has merit.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about panels and efficiencies.  On the efficiencies we see arising, once we have identified the sites some schemes may operate across different local authorities.  Work with the local authorities on how the management of oversight of such schemes would work is now well advanced.  We see some efficiencies arising there.  On the Deputy's point on procurement, having recently joined the agency I am looking at the issue with my colleagues to see if we can squeeze those timelines further.  The aim of everybody in the NDFA, the local authorities and the Department is to provide these units as fast as we can, but also as safely as we can.  We want to make this process quicker.  <\/p> <p>  On the timelines, we know that housing will be an issue for the next five to ten years.  We need short-term measures, and various agencies are looking at them, but the homes delivered next year and in subsequent years are a very valuable part of the overall solution.  To put it in context, PPPs make up a relatively small part of the proposed solution.  We talk about them as if they were providing 50% of output or something like that.  It is nowhere near that figure.  PPPs account for a relatively small proportion of the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Bryce"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":760,"content":"<p>What is the timeline for the publication of the public sector benchmark?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#J00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":761,"content":"<p>It is slightly complicated because we are in a programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Bryce"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Ms Bryce is saying it will be published after the third bundle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#J00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":763,"content":"<p>That is potentially the case.

Some within that group do significant research on housing stock.  On the point in respect of delivery, views vary not only on the amount we will need in the future, but also on the obsolescence rate.  For example, buildings that are now 30 years old may need to be replaced.  Even the numbers the NDFA referred to in terms of its delivery will not meet that level of demand.  I made a note of three recent assessments of the obsolescence rate, as opposed to the immediate demand rate.  They vary from a figure of 6,000 to a figure of 16,000.  Some members of the SCSI would say it is closer to 6,000 and some would say it is closer to 16,000.  If one picks any number within that range, one would still need a variety of mechanisms to deliver on the demand.  From the society's point of view and from discussing the issue with our members, the NDFA's role in that delivery is essential because a mechanism is needed.  We started from a standing start in that, as I said earlier, the market was in disarray, it took a long while to get going, and NAMA had to deal with the commercial elements first to inject life back into the industry.

Can we presume that inflation is still included in any tender document?  I get very nervous when I hear witnesses saying that something came in below benchmark because I am not in favour of lowest-price tendering.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that issue.  Sometimes necessary elements are taken out of tenders in order to win a contract.  What is the minimum number of units required before the NDFA gets involved?  Are all sites earmarked now or are there more in the pipeline for the future?  In terms of local authority staff, somewhere between 700 and 900 additional posts have been approved, predominantly in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  It obviously takes time for the public appointments process to work itself out and by the time posts are finalised, some candidates have been snapped up by the private sector.  Ms Myler referred to the opportunity for local authorities to enhance their project knowledge by taking on the developer-promoter role.  How long will that take?  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett made reference to the site in Shanganagh and while I disagree with him on the breakdown of the housing mix, we both want to see homes built on that site.  A proposal was made by three local authority members, namely, Councillor John Bailey who is my father, Councillor Michael Merrigan and Councillor Shane O'Brien of Sinn F&eacute;in more than two years ago.  It took about nine months to put together their very detailed proposal and we are all exceptionally frustrated at how long it is taking to get any responses to that proposal.  Rent-to-buy was part of the proposal but I understand that the local authority is opting for the cost-rental model.  I do not understand why a portion of the cost-rental homes could not be rent-to-buy.  A rent-to-buy scheme was piloted in 2006 or 2007 in Stepaside and was very successful.  After a number of years of renting, people were given the opportunity to purchase properties at an affordable rate.  I hope that model will be considered again in the context of the Shanganagh site.  That scheme also contains housing options for older people.  This committee has prepared an extensive report on options for older people to downsize in both the public and private sectors.  If one looks at the population in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown one sees that the demand for one-bedroom units is significant and increasing.  <\/p> <p>  On the skills shortage issue, I know how proactive the SCSI is in this area.  It is constantly engaging with its membership and actively encouraging those who emigrated to return home.  In order to get the professionals to come home to fill the gaps, they will need to see continuity and certainty in the construction sector.  Does the Project Ireland 2040 plan provide some of that?  I am also aware that housing projects are competing with large-scale infrastructure projects.  We had a meeting yesterday on the impact of Brexit on housing.  We had a very interesting discussion with representatives from the ESRI and the Nevin Economic Research Institute who spoke about the building materials that we import from the UK, which can range from 30% to 50%.  They also referred to inflationary costs that could come down the line once Britain leaves the EU.  I ask the witnesses to give their views on that issue.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Cleary said that we need to look beyond the immediate and that is what we are doing with the Land Development Agency.  The interim CEO of the agency, Mr. John Coleman, appeared before this committee recently.  He talked about derisking sites and how that will take place in practice.  It was a very informative and encouraging meeting.  I presume that the SCSI has met or intends to meet representatives of the Land Development Agency and that engagement is ongoing.  On the issue of risk and the removal of same, while we must consider pre-development risks we cannot forget the risks when workers are on site.  That aspect is often underestimated.  People seem to think that builders are just there to make money and that there is no risk involved in actual building.  Whether one is talking about a single house or 500 units, there is always a risk when builders are on site.  There are numerous risks involved in construction of which people are not really aware.  I ask the witnesses to talk through that.  <\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe it would be possible for local authorities to deliver the same quantity of housing without land initiatives or PPPs?  Land initiatives rely on private developers to deliver units but is this the best use of public land?  The Land Development Agency is a good initiative.  At yesterday's meeting witnesses said that we cannot do everything in one year.  Given that very little construction happened for a number of years, it has taken time to get back up and running again.  It will take some more time before the sector is capable of delivering 30,000 units per year.  <\/p> <p>  I now invite Senator Murnane O'Connor to pose questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#K00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":771,"content":"<p>The Chairman has covered a lot of the areas about which I am concerned.  A culture change is needed in the Department.  Having read through the information provided on PPPs and AHBs, it is quite clear that the Government is not encouraging direct building by the local authorities but is relying heavily on the HAP scheme to house those on local authority waiting lists.  However, there are not enough houses to rent.  I can categorically say that in my own area there is not enough housing.  We do not have enough units.  We are not building the right types of housing either.  There are very few two-bedroom units being built or units designed for people with disabilities.  Our criteria and outlook are all wrong.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to a woman recently about co-housing models in Denmark, involving communal housing for elderly people, younger people and so on.  We are not looking at the bigger picture when it comes to housing.  We are not delivering the right housing stock.  Local authorities have moved away from the concept of direct build local authority housing.  We built local authority houses 100 years ago and there was nothing wrong with them.  Now the focus is on Part V developments, many of which are happening in my own area as well as PPPs and approved housing body houses.  A culture change is happening whereby people will never be able to buy the house in which they are living.  This is normal in many other European countries, whereby people do not buy their homes but enter into long leases, for 99 years and so on.  Many of the new agencies involved in providing housing now do not give tenants the option to buy.  That is very unfair on people who are working and who want the option to buy.  The Government must encourage the local authorities to use their land banks to build public housing and to give people the option to buy.  <\/p> <p>  We also need to reconsider the HAP scheme, given the amount of money that is being spent on private rental accommodation.

We will not be able to build if we do not set aside money for construction or for use in the likes of approved housing bodies.  It is my biggest concern.  We are not looking forward to put proper housing in place.  Apartments are okay for cities but I always think rural areas are forgotten.  I come to the meeting of this housing committee every week and the first figures we see are for apartments in Dublin but we must look after rural Ireland.  Apartments are not suitable for rural Ireland so technically what we build is not suitable.<\/p> <p>  Through public-private partnerships we are looking at building three-bedroom houses all the time.  We are looking at a specific type of house rather than other areas, and that is where we are falling down as well.  It is not working.  Much more power, money and funding is required.  We should be encouraging local authorities to buy land and build local authority houses.  It is not happening now and our culture is changing.  That is not right.  More people are coming to me about the housing they have been given through approved housing bodies like Cl&uacute;id, Respond! and these different agencies.  They do not have an option so we are encouraging something that is not right.  If there is a culture change, can we come to some agreement with all these different agencies so that people can purchase housing in the long term?  We must look at where the funding is going.  It is a finance agency and people must be accountable for the money spent.  None of this will be sorted out unless we stop paying millions of euro through HAP on rented accommodation.  We are paying more for long-term rent than we would in building houses.

The Chairman asked about the best use of public land.  With the PPP schemes the land remains within the State and if it is felt that it is not the best use over time, a change of direction could come about.  Some of the land initiatives will provide private and affordable housing.  It is really a matter for the Department as to how best to utilise that resource.  No matter what, it will go towards providing housing in the broader concept, so it is going some way to helping to resolve the matter and ease house price inflation.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on whether this quantity could be supplied in the same way if everything was done through direct building.  I may have answered the question already.  Given the very significant demands in terms of quantities to be provided, we should use every channel and, as I stated, keep them up and running rather than stepping them down only to step them up again at some point in the future.  That makes sense as much hard work goes into trying to set both PPP, land initiative and enhanced leasing schemes.  There is much devil in the detail for both local authorities to be happy that these are good schemes that they can operate and for the Department to be happy with them.  The private sector must first be able to understand them and then be able to bid on them and try to get some efficiencies in the replication.  It appears we are at a juncture.  Demands are so high that we should try to use all channels for delivery.<\/p> <p>  The question on the number of units relates to the third bundle of social housing.  It is envisaged this would be approximately 500 units.  We do not have any visibility of any more sites currently.  It is a decision for the Department.  We are keen to try to keep the channel open but there are many other considerations relating to sustainability and macroeconomic factors.  As members are aware, the PPP schemes are 100% social housing and localities must be considered for suitability with regard to mix in an area.  There are many considerations in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There was a point about the lowest price tenders and we are acutely aware and conscious of that.  We are afraid, I suppose, of the private sector making too much profit from schemes but also of underbidding, as has happened in some cases, before contractors get into trouble.  In the end, this causes a problem for the State if it has to step in to resolve the matter.  With regard to PPP bidding criteria, 60% of marks go towards design, quality and management of the scheme, with 40% going towards the financial aspects.  That helps achieve balance in the tender.  Our sense is that the bid is very competitive across each of those criteria, which is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Bryce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I am happy to address the issues of staffing and skill shortages.  We have undertaken two significant studies in the past five years to identify what the motivation and constraint factors were.  We have probably been a little too successful in promoting the idea of technology as a panacea for employment.  Technology is clearly of great interest to young people.  We try to sell a vision of our industry, but it has been difficult given the boom-bust cycles we have had for many years.  Moreover, the industry, which was relatively fragmented, became even more fragmented as a result of the collapse in the economy and has not come back together again.  We are also defaulting to traditional forms of delivery because we have not had investment in research and development or innovation.  We have been calling for the establishment of a centre for innovation in construction for some years.  It would involve a lot of off-site construction and would help to reduce costs and enable more efficient and effective delivery.  Indeed, it could become a whole area of employment in and of itself and might provide an exporting opportunity for this country because we are good at this sort of thing.<\/p> <p>  We need to develop a sense that the construction and property sectors are technology sectors.  That will only happen if a forward-facing and well-resourced strategy is put in place.  I suggest the Government will have to get some skin in the game.  A significant study undertaken in the UK a few years ago, entitled the Farmer review, which I am sure everyone has read, pointed out the issues the UK faces.  They are very similar to the issues we face, but are bigger because the UK is a bigger marketplace.  We are trying to sell a future to a 15 year old, but all he or she is seeing is shortages, boom-bust cycles, negativity and what looks like traditional block-on-block type activity.  We have to generate a whole new vision for the sector.  <\/p> <p>  Thankfully, some off-site innovation is taking place.  Building information modelling, BIM, as a platform has been discussed.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is looking very closely at how it can make public procurement more agile, while staying within the constraints of EU directives and state aid in that sector.  I have a 19 year old at home and there is not a chance that I could have induced him to enter this industry or profession in the past ten years.  We are challenged in that respect, and we are constantly trying to knit those things together to make the sector attractive.<\/p> <p>  Ms Bryce referenced the need for pipeline provision and the need to demonstrate that there will be work available.  There was a discussion as to whether the national development plan, NDP, is a reason for people to come back home.  The construction project tracker, developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is a really interesting tool.  As it expands the information available on it and breaks down the stages of construction into various milestones, it will provide an interesting way of showing people a pipeline of projects is still in place.  We need the capacity and so there will be a place for those who want to get involved.  The recruitment being undertaken by the local authorities, which is in competition with a marketplace that is also looking for those resources, is providing a challenge.  Our focus is ensuring that delivery of projects in the sector, not just the perception of it, changes.  Some of that will require investment by public and private entities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":784,"content":"<p>The Chair referenced the Land Development Agency and the need to ensure the best use of public lands and deliver the correct type of units.  Wearing the planning hat, as a planning and development surveyor, it is important to make sure that we have all the relevant information.  In an earlier answer, I referred to obsolescence and the work required to quantify the number of obsolescent housing units and understand the actual number of units that need to be replaced, discounting the surges in demand that occur.  That work could be given to an entity such as the Land Development Agency or at least made part of someone's work stream.<\/p> <p>  The types of housing units to be delivered are also a consideration.  There are regional residential units and also residential units in the larger urban areas.  There has to be an assessment of what the need is now and going forward in terms of housing for older people.  We also hope that some of the employment opportunities in the IT sector will move to the regions rather than just Dublin.  Within that there should be an assessment of the types of housing these workers require.  We are involved in a number of development schemes for high-tech entities that are expanding here.  It is interesting that they bring people from their place of origin to advise them on the types of units they require and also the short-term nature of some of the units required.  Perhaps this is an urban phenomenon, but we have to figure out a way of delivering that, while addressing the high cost issues to which Ms Myler has referred. <\/p> <p>  The influence of technology in the sector and long-term requirements for energy efficiency are other issues to be addressed.  We are attempting to get the suggestions in this area across the line by 2040.  The ideal scenario, from a planning and development perspective, is that someone will take the 2040 plan - perhaps the Land Development Agency or its equivalent - and employs a variety of work streams which would allow it to generate robust and important statistical information and apply the findings to assist in implementing the plan where information has to be provided.  Various sites also have to be targeted.  From the planning and development perspective, I have been in front of many local authorities to discuss their role in the planning process, which involves zoning and managing the process.  Sometimes when we approach the local authorities with specific sites we are told they never anticipated that the site would be used for development.  This is particularly the case in terms of the ownership of public utilities, ports, hospitals and other areas.  We tell them there is a way to make such sites useable and set out how it could be done.  The Land Development Agency will become much more important in this area because brownfield site delivery, once we get over the current issues, will be the next challenge.  There is only a certain level of building we can do.  We cannot keep going beyond the existing boundary lines of our properties.  The cost of delivery in the Netherlands and other places was mentioned earlier.  It is easier to make something of a site is it close to public transport nodes.  That issue ties back in so that there is a joined up approach covering planning and development.  That issue must be prioritised and must not be lost in the immediate discussion of the physical delivery of units.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cleary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>Shanganagh was mentioned.

The reality is that we do not have enough houses.  Everyone, including local authorities and the different Departments, must sit down and have a conversation but this is not happening.  It frightens me to think that people are passing the buck.  People are happy to say that something is not part of their remit and that they have nothing to do with it.  Unless we sit down and have this conversation, we will be back here in 2021 and will be no further along.  We have a housing crisis.

Mr. Reynolds argument was that this would be cheaper and the State would also control the timeline.  That seems to be a very good suggestion in light of the number of sites on which we are hoping to secure Part V builds but the matter is completely in the hands of a private developer.  In the case of Cherrywood, the developer has already flipped some of the land.  We do not know what is going to happen there.  If the State took its 10% upfront - I would like that percentage to increase to 20% or more - and started to build on it, that would move things forward.

We should focus on building on the sites we have that are ready to go, rather than going to more complex sites.  I probably differ with Deputy Boyd Barrett on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#N01400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":801,"content":"<p>In fairness, I am asking the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#N01500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I am asking the same question from a different point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#N01600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#N01700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":804,"content":"<p>As Chair, I am also a committee member and I am entitled to ask the same questions as the Deputy.

I am familiar with them by name but I am not involved with them directly.  There were probably infrastructure or historical title issues on some of those sites that needed to be addressed.  It is now likely that the funding is being put in place, as has happened for many of these sites in the past 24 months.<\/p> <p>  I am presuming that these sites have planning permission, which has a lifespan of five years or thereabouts.  It is not in the landowners' interests not to start moving because the planning permission will expire. Under planning law, if a certain percentage of the scheme is not under way within the duration of the permission the capacity to deliver on that permission becomes null and void.

Would ransom strips be created because access to infrastructure such as roads, foul sewers, etc., would be needed?  These are just observations.

I am CEO of the ICSH, the national federation of housing associations.  Mr colleague Mr. O'Connor is CEO of the T&uacute;ath Housing Association, one of our active tier 3 member bodies providing housing throughout the country.  The ICSH has more than 250 members.  Collectively, the sector manages more than 35,000 homes at affordable rents for families, older people, people with disabilities, the homeless and single people.  The committee is probably familiar with our members as being more single purpose organisations dedicated to the management of homes and the building of sustainable communities.  Housing associations work in partnership with local authorities and play their part collectively in meeting the housing needs of people assessed as being in need of housing by local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Approved housing bodies are to provide one third of the 50,000 homes to be supplied under Rebuilding Ireland until 2021, which equates to approximately 15,000 homes per year, with local authorities providing the bulk.  In 2017 Approved housing bodies in the housing association sector delivered 2,330 long-term permanent social rented homes, that was the highest annual level the sector had ever recorded and accounted for around one third of the overall delivery of permanent social housing, with local authorities providing the remainder.  As part of the increased delivery by approved housing bodies, a number of larger tier 3 bodies provided a significant number of homes and have ongoing development programmes for the coming years.  Of the 2,330 homes delivered by the sector in 2017, 1,078 were delivered through new construction, 760 through acquisitions and 492 through long-term leasing.<\/p> <p>  In July the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, through the Housing Agency, issued a second call for proposals under the enhanced leasing scheme as part of its delivery under Rebuilding Ireland.  Enhanced leasing appears to be targeted at developers and new builds, vacant properties and new homes to the market, with properties to be delivered at scale and at a minimum of 20 homes.  Enhanced leasing is intended to complement the existing long-term measures available from local authorities.  As structured, the scheme provides a long-term leasing arrangement, whereby property owners provide maintenance services and local authorities lease the units and take on landlord responsibilities.  The property owner is paid rent of up to 95% of the market rent and the local authority collects differential rent from the tenants.  Homes are provided by the properties' owners and the other stakeholders - the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested approved housing bodies could have a role under the scheme.  To date, they have not been involved in its design.  The enhanced leasing scheme could work in some cases where an approved housing body is contracted by the local authority under a service level agreement to provide landlord or tenant services as an agent.  In our analysis, however, this scenario could present issues for the approved housing body.  For example, it could only resolve issues on the ground such as rent arrears and the performance of the lessor in providing repairs and maintenance services through the local authority.  In this scenario the role of the approved housing body is limited and where problems arise, the intervention of the local authority is key, as it is the contractual partner to the lessor.<\/p> <p>  Another possible arrangement that has been mooted but is not part of the scheme could see an approved housing body act as landlord, with the tenant signed up to the body's own tenancy agreement.  The body would have the flexibility to take action as and when required.<\/p> <p>  The sector is open to different options for making the scheme work, but there are probably value for money issues with enhanced leasing and it does not provide permanent social housing.  In our limited contact with stakeholders in the private sector they have indicated to us that there are issues with how properties would be managed.  In a sense, how social housing is managed is not private developers' primary focus.<\/p> <p>  An investor-led lease that attracted pension and ethical funds and was provided by professional non-profit housing management could be delivered by approved housing bodies over the period of the lease and beyond.<\/p><p>It can be off balance sheet and typical of models in other EU member states, with both approved housing bodies and local authorities participating at scale.<br\/><br\/>Land initiatives are linked with local authorities in terms of the supply of land.  For housing associations to increase the delivery of new social housing homes, access to sites is critical.  To date, this has occurred on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  A continuous supply of residential land and sites is central to having a development pipeline in the housing association sector being able to meet its social housing targets.<br\/><br\/>Up to 2010, approved housing bodies had access to land in local communities, which included land donated with covenants by charitable bodies, as well as land accessed below market value.  In addition, one of the most successful schemes for approved housing bodies was the local authority low cost sites scheme, under which local authorities transferred sites to housing associations to allow them to provide housing and supports for people on local authority waiting lists.  These options are now severely limited.  Together with the sector having virtually no landbank of its own, this has meant that it has had in recent years to organise other routes to gain access to building sites.  Some of them have necessitated housing associations working with the private sector through various turnkey and joint ventures to deliver housing.  This has been important in being able to stimulate employment for local construction firms, as well as providing new homes.  However, there are still several local authority sites being developed by approved housing bodies.  Examples include Respond in Blackpool in Cork, T&uacute;ath Housing in Crumlin in Dublin and and Cl&uacute;id in Kinsale, County Cork.  In addition, a number of local authority regeneration projects are being developed by approved housing bodies in partnership with the local authority.  They include Cl&uacute;id at St. Mary's Mansions in Dublin and Fold at Dolphins Park in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>Recently, there has been a call by the Housing Agency for expressions of interest to approved housing bodies for 37 sites they have available for social and other forms of housing.  The sites include those assembled through the land aggregation scheme.  This is welcome as it provides another option for approved housing bodies.<br\/><br\/>In our view, the new Land Development Agency can play a crucial role in enabling activation of suitable State-owned sites for both social and affordable rental housing in a strategic manner, as well as enabling delivery with landowners in the private sector.  It is important that there be a strong focus on ensuring all suitable State land is made available for housing purposes.  The onus should be on the public or State body to explain why the land should not be available to be prioritised for housing.<br\/><br\/>Public private partnerships have a limited role in this process.  A small number of approved housing bodies have worked with PPPs in several ways through the social housing delivery programme as one of the partners.  However, here is a long lead-in time in this process.  The role tends to be more as a management agent.  The social housing PPP bundles are based on the provision of services in developments over a 25-year period following construction that will include the maintenance and upkeep of housing, with the return of the asset after 25 years to the owner.<br\/><br\/>In contributing to the housing system the examples given are part of the menu of responses to compliment mainstream delivery by housing associations and local authorities.  Land initiatives potentially can have the most significant and positive long-term impact on the housing and land markets.  Nothing has been done since the Kenny report and the report of the all-party Oireachtas committee in 2003.  This will assist in the provision of housing, both social housing and other tenures, where affordability is a key concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I call on Dr. Hearne to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#P00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":813,"content":"<p>My presentation is based on 20 years of academic research and community practitioner experience in the areas of social housing and economic policy.  I hope it will provide some useful insights into how we can solve the continually worsening housing emergency.  There is a real requirement to think deeply about our policies and critically about why we are in this crisis.  Some of what I might say might be quite strong, but I ask the joint committee to reflect on it in the spirit in which it is contributed in this debate.<\/p> <p>  The new enhanced social housing leasing scheme and social housing PPPs are, in fact, handing social housing delivery over to the private market.  It forms part of the approach taken in the new LDA and the Government's wider housing plan, Rebuilding Ireland.  It involves the outsourcing and privatisation of social housing and is a key reason we are in this crisis.  Rather than the State guaranteeing the supply of new social and affordable housing by funding sufficiently and overseeing the building of housing via local authorities, co-operatives and housing associations, it is turning to the private market.  This is despite the private market's repeated failure to deliver social and affordable housing, as well as value for money.  The only conclusion one can draw is that the Government, through the Housing Agency, has an ideological aversion to the State actually building social housing and being the developer but believes in the primacy and efficiency of the market.<\/p> <p>  PPPs and leasing are inherently risky approaches.  They are marketised forms of delivery which tend to suffer from major delays or fail completely because they are dependent on whether the private sector decides to build, finance or become involved at all.  It is down to the profitability and commercial viability assessments of private developers, investors and private finance.  My research shows that they tend to be geared towards this, rather than maximising social housing provision, as well as providing value for money for the people.<\/p> <p>  We are entering a highly risky period in trying to access private finance in a deeply uncertain time with Brexit, President Trump, etc.  What happens two or three years down the road with a PPP when a private developer decides it is no longer viable and pulls out?  In such an approach one is handing over all control to a highly risky private market.  We saw this with the latest PPP housing projects.  Although they were announced three years ago, they are still not even at contract award stage.  It is the same with the Dublin PPP lands initiative sites.  They started over three years ago, but there is still no building.  As a result, we have public lands lying idle in the midst of a crisis, while the State engages in a form of market speculation.  If it built on the land four years ago, today it would have tens of thousands of extra social housing units.  When the land is sold and transferred, it is gone.<\/p> <p>  The value for money aspect of the PPP and leasing projects is extremely dubious.  The method of value for money analysis used by the public sector is not released, as it is deemed to be commercially sensitive.  Accordingly, there is no evidence to show that the projects actually are value for money.  The cost of providing social housing via the new leasing scheme is at 95% of market rent.  In Dublin the average rent is &euro;2,000 per month.  With rising rents, over 25 years it will cost &euro;600,000 per unit to price a house in this way.  This is &euro;420,000 per unit more expensive than building directly through a local authority or housing association.  If one adds in the fact that the State has the asset at the end and conservatively values it at, say, &euro;150,000, the total cost of delivering social housing via leasing is &euro;750,000 per unit, which is four times more expensive.  For every leased housing unit paid for over 25 years, one could build four local authority homes.  For the cost of the 10,000 leased social housing units over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland, we could be building 40,000 permanent social housing units.  The approach also locks the State into paying expensive rents in perpetuity.  Entering lease agreements at a point of high rents is not good value for money.  As rents fall, which they inevitably will at some point, the State will be left paying inflated rents.<\/p> <p>  The LDA is operating under the same failed principle.  It is about incentivising and making it financially viable for the private sector to become involved using State land and subsidies to deliver social housing.<\/p><p>It is a massive transfer of wealth from the State and the people of this country to the private sector.  We must ask what is the most efficient use of our national resources to meet people's social needs and rights.  The current approaches do not use our land and finance in an effective way.  They are, in fact, a form of corporate welfare whereby the State is providing billions of euro in hand-outs to the private commercial sector and wealthy real estate investment trusts. There is a deep contradiction in State housing policy which aims towards affordability and social housing provision but works towards incentivising, subsidising and rebooting the private property industry using PPPs and leasing within its corporate welfare approach.  The current housing functions quite well for some, such as landlords, banks and investors, but it is badly failing the many locked out in \"generation rent\" and homelessness.<\/p><p> The social housing leasing scheme adds to the crisis and the lack of genuinely affordable supply.  Leasing, like the housing assistance payment scheme, takes supply away from the housing system which could otherwise be used for rental or home purchase.  Through these schemes, the State is taking from supply rather than adding to it.  Why does the Government not build through the State and not-for-profit housing associations and co-operatives whereby one does not pay the additional cost of developer profit and expensive private finance and does not have the risk of the entire project being delayed and collapsing?  My research on PPPs in 2008 evidenced that PPPs are 25-year projects which require significant legal contracts to manage.  For example, in the case of schools some principals were consulting lengthy contracts to decide if the grass had been cut long enough or whose responsibility it was to fix a window.  Who will be responsible for the maintenance of PPP and leasing schemes?  With whom will the tenant be able to raise issues?  Will the local authority penalise a private provider which is not doing what it ought?  Of course, local authorities do not penalise such providers because of the relationship and contract which are in place.  Another issue is that PPPs and private leasing require a significant institutional effort on the part of local authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That effort would be better put into building public housing.<\/p><p> There is an alternative approach which offers better value for money and has a guaranteed approach of delivery, namely, true public housing built by local authorities, housing associations and co-operatives.  We are in the midst of a major crisis.  We need to radically shift to building 20,000 public affordable homes using those various forms.  We have the land, finance and fiscal space to do so.  Why are we pursuing models that do not work and have not proved value for money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rory Hearne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Hearne.  He has hit the nail on the head.  The lack of building by local authorities is the biggest issue with which we must deal.  All local authorities have landbanks.  They built houses 100 years ago and never experienced problems such as those we face today.  We are relying on the private market.  I note that Dr. Hearne mentioned leasing three or four times in his address.  Leasing is the housing assistance payment, HAP.  We have gone down the route of private leasing and because there is no joined-up thinking.  The system is very unfair.  The problem is that if we pump money into leasing and renting houses, it takes away from building.  Local authorities are more affected by that than any other body.  Of all the issues I have heard on housing, I congratulate Dr. Hearne on what he said.  It was 100% right.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned to our previous speakers, there is co-operative communal housing in Denmark in which people might share eating areas or laundry rooms.  Is Dr. Hearne aware of that scheme?  In the long term we need to change our perception of housing because people are living longer.  People are in four-bedroom family homes but may need only one of the bedrooms.  I refer to older people and people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  In the long term, local authorities are key.  They can build houses more cheaply because they have the land on which to do so.  Why are local authorities not building on their land?  We are told that finance is available, so what is the problem?  What is the plan regarding elderly people and people with disabilities downsizing from four-bedroom houses to two or one bedrooms?  We are told that the relevant figures are available.  However, there has not been sufficient progress in my area, which is the only area on which I can focus.  We need to deal with the housing issue on a national basis and come up with solutions for the thousands of people who are homeless.  I ask Dr. Hearne to address some of the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#Q00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It is almost as though we have three tiers in terms of funding for social housing delivery.  There are various funding mechanisms for private sector-led developments such as PPPs or enhanced leasing whereby the developer gets full cost recovery plus additional premium and risk.  They get the highest level of payment for what they do.  Approved housing bodies get a lower level of deal.  They get full build cost over the lifetime of the availability agreement, an element of cost recovery for maintenance, although I am sure there is a tough haggle between the bodies and the Department in that regard, and a small administration fee.  Local authorities get build costs but do not get an availability agreement and, therefore, do not get full cost recovery and must rely on differential rents.  It is not a level playing field for the three sectors.  Do Mr. McManus and Mr. O'Connor consider that a fair characterisation in terms of their projects and the engagement of some of their members in PPPs, etc.?  What is their view on the unfair advantage which many of us consider the private sector is getting over their sector through enhanced leasing and PPPs?  For example, it is not possible for them to apply for enhanced leasing because one would need 100% capital upfront and it is unlikely that a bank would lend 100% capital to most tier 3 approved housing bodies, which is why we have Government grants, etc.<\/p> <p>  My other concern regards public private partnerships.  There is a PPP scheme in my constituency which will be managed by an approved housing body.  Do Mr. McManus and Mr. O'Connor and their members consider that a space which the approved housing body sector wants to be in?  Is it sensible for the approved housing body sector to be in that space rather than the direct delivery and management of its own stock?<\/p> <p>  If an AHB gets a plot of land from a local authority, it usually develops that land in accordance with local housing need following discussions with the local authority.  However, under the Land Development Agency, LDA, it appears that there is a prescribed designation of 10% social and 30% affordable.  We have been told that there is some flexibility in that regard but have seen not evidence of it.  Its approach seems to be solely based on what the market can bear in terms of the financing of the development.  Is that a fair statement?  Do the witnesses have any concerns in that regard.  They highlighted that it could be very beneficial in terms of accessing land for the LDA to works with their sector.  Do they have a concern regarding large tracts of land only having allocations of 10% social housing and 30% affordable housing?<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Hearne knows, we share the perspective he outlined in his submission.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, representatives of which appeared before the committee earlier, cannot release many of the hard data which we think would allow us to evidence our claims that it is not cost effective.  Has Dr. Hearne uncovered any hard data or comparative costings in his research to evidence the claims that private sector-led projects through leasing and public private partnerships offer better value for money?  The NDFA, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Department state that such schemes promote risk sharing by off-loading some of the risk onto the private sector.  I am not asking for Dr. Hearne's opinion but, rather, for him to present the committee with hard evidence from his or other research to demonstrate that the claim of risk sharing with the private sector is not all it is cracked up to be.  How much of that risk ends up rebounding onto the State?  <\/p> <p>  I acknowledge what was stated by the representatives of the approved housing bodies regarding land availability and finance issues.  Obviously, they have a significant set of targets to reach under Rebuilding Ireland in the coming years.<\/p><p>My question is a slight aside from our conversation but, at the same time, connected.  Given the lands in the pipeline and the availability of finance coming down the tracks, particularly in the light of the on-balance sheet status of the sector, how confident are the delegates that their organisations will be able to meet the targets?  Do they have concerns of which they would like to make us aware?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#Q00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":818,"content":"<p>The statistics for quarters 1 and 2 for local authority house building in 2018 have been published.  The total number of new local authority builds completed by the end of June was 350.  The figure for Cork city was zero.  The figure for County Cork was one.  Twelve of the 31 local authorities had completed zero new local authority builds by the end of June, yet we are in the middle of the greatest housing crisis in the history of the State.  Clearly, the current policy is not working.  Hearing alternative proposals, some of which have been outlined at this meeting, is important and useful for the committee.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Hearne has given us an interesting figure.  Of the 134,000 new social housing units to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland by the end of 2021, 85% will be private sector solutions, with the remainder to be local authority and AHB new builds, or public provision in reality.  Clearly, that policy is not working.  I like the fact that the speakers have identified alternative models and given examples from other European countries of different ways in which to approach the issue.  Austria and Denmark were cited as examples where public housing provision was between 35% and 40% of overall stock, as opposed to a mere 10% in this country.  It is interesting to consider how that came to pass.  Social housing provision in Austria jumped ahead in leaps and bounds in the inter-war period.  It was a society that was far less wealthy than Irish society is today.  In Vienna 250,000 public apartments were built for the city's working population.  The maximum rent at the time was 4% of a worker's income.  If a person was sick or unemployed, he or she would not pay rent.  The communities in which the apartments were provided had GP services, cr&egrave;che services, communal laundries and food provisions.  If a left-wing council in Vienna could do that in the poverty of the inter-war years, why can a society in one of the wealthiest countries in Europe - ours - not organise even a fraction of that public housing provision?  It is a question of whether there is a will at Government level.  There is not and that needs to change.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the way forward is public housing on public land.  My question relates to the price of building public housing on public land and the price at which public housing can be offered to workers on average wages, including young people who have been locked out of the housing market.  The &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance project in Poppintree has given us a glimpse of what might be possible.  My understanding is three-bedroom homes were delivered at approximately the &euro;170,000 mark each.  As we do not want to draw conclusions from just one example, let us take a more overarching view.  Some years ago, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, produced statistics which indicated that close to 50% of the cost of a house was tied up in one of four elements: the cost of land, the developer's profit, the banker's profit and State taxes.  If we were to adopt a policy of providing public housing on public land, we could fight on four fronts.  The land could be provided for free by the State as a contribution to tackling the housing emergency.  State taxes could be waived; that is not impossible.  Bankers' profits would be significantly less because, if the State was to borrow at a rate of 1% or thereabouts, it would be far cheaper than a developer borrowing at a rate of 6%, which is probably the going rate.  To factor in the risk of a private company going belly up, a bank will charge more.  If there was a State construction company or, in the large cities, councils had direct labour units, there would be no need for developers' profits.  If such initiatives were not in place, the State could hire builders.  A profit would have to be factored in, but it would be significantly less than developers' profits.<\/p> <p>  The SCSI's figures indicate that, if a house cannot be built for half the current market price, it can be built for damn close to it.

I agree strongly with Dr. Hearne's narrative about the inefficiency, cost and viability of PPPs, or privatised forms of social housing delivery, being crazy from the point of view of trying to resolve the housing crisis.  Instead, we need to move urgently towards the direct provision of public housing on public land.<\/p> <p>  I am curious to know the delegates' opinions on what is happening in the private sector and its capacity to deliver.  We have gone over how relying on the private sector to deliver public housing will cost us a fortune.  On the leasing component, Dr. Hearne added to the facts we already knew.  It is a stark figure, in that we could get four directly built council houses for the cost of leasing one for 25 years.  He produced the staggering figure of in excess of &euro;20 billion for the overall cost of the HAP scheme over a period of 35 years.  That is a folly about which we have all talked a great deal and which we have contrasted with direct provision by council housing which is cheaper, faster, more efficient and better at every level.  What we have not talked about enough - it is the matter on which I would like to get the delegates' opinion - is the question of where the private market is going.  Aside from the cost issue, is the private market capable of delivering the housing the Government hopes it will?  Mr. Mel Reynolds has made a convincing argument that, whatever we may think about the private market's capacity to deliver social housing - we do not think much of it - it may not be able to deliver any housing at all on the scale the Government imagines it will.<\/p><p>This is because the costs for the private sector are now so high that it is becoming increasingly tenuous as to whether it is viable at all for the private sector to deliver.  At some point, it will become very clear that is just not viable for the private sector, which is an even bigger reason to shift over to public sector provision.  I am curious as to the thoughts of the witnesses on that, given it has already been said that an incredible 85% of the Rebuilding Ireland plan is dependent on private sector output, which is terrifying.  Where we are heading is terrifying.  Would the witnesses agree that we really have to start ringing the alarm bells on that front?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#R00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":823,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor will cover finance and I will cover some of the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542186000,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I am a surveyor by trade so I have been in housing and construction for 35 years.  It is clear that the solution to the housing crisis is to build more affordable and social housing because too many people are being housed in the private sector and it is having an inflationary effect on rents.  There is an increasing trend where developers are building to sell to institutional investors to rent and we compete with those institutional investors to buy blocks of flats for social housing, and we get a lot of flak for it, but our intention is to buy them and rent them as social housing.<\/p> <p>  There is a capacity issue in the construction sector in Ireland.  After the big crash, a number of big firms are not there anymore.  Some have been reincarnated as smaller operators but banking finance is still a problem for a lot of firms.  There is definitely a skills and labour shortage that is feeding through to prices.  I do not know what we do about that.  Developers are usually focused on the short term.  They build and they go.  It is becoming even more short term because there are not necessarily a lot of sites being built for owner-occupiers to buy into.  They are selling to investors, hundreds of units at a time.  They are targeting one buyer and they go.  They are not focused on the long term.  They are not building to place make and to stay.  As a housing association or local authority, that is what they do.<\/p> <p>  One quite radical solution that probably needs to be looked at is that local authorities go back to direct building so they are not relying on the private sector, not contracting out and have their own direct labour organisations build the houses, not to maintain the houses.  There is not enough work being done on training and apprenticeships in Ireland.  That needs to happen.  A key thing would be to combine that with off-site manufacturing, where homes are built in controlled conditions in factories and are transported to houses.  We have three sites at the moment with Modern Homes Ireland, an organisation based in Cavan, and 80% of the homes are made in the factory and transported to the site.  Our biggest site is in Ardee and has 102 homes.  They are going up in half the time of a traditional build.  They are not as labour intensive.  The only pressure we have is the factory is now exporting to England.  They are not just catering for the home market.<\/p> <p>  Taxes were mentioned.  As an association, we pay VAT and, as part of our funding, the Exchequer provides VAT.  It gives with one hand.  It is madness, and adds to the inflationary effect.<\/p> <p>  There is a reliance on the private sector.  I would like to see more done by local authorities and our sector.  A worrying trend concerns the enhanced leasing scheme in that developers have no track record of building to stay or manage housing, not even private housing, and yet the State seems to be looking at that sector to deliver through enhanced leasing and to manage social housing.  There is nothing wrong with profit, but profiteering is happening now.  It can be seen with some of the companies who are buying up housing at scale.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see a more mature debate about funding because I think pension funds are a big solution to Ireland's problem - not vulture funds, but pension funds, where they are matching pension liabilities.  We are talking to a number of pension funds, some Irish, some not, and some union funds which want to invest in social housing.  They want ethical investment.  There is no vehicle there.  There is a private lease for small landlords.  There is now an enhanced lease for developer-led landlords.  There needs to be an investor lease, where they just put the money in and retreat and look to councils or associations to look after the property.  The pension funds do not even have an interest in the property.  Many of them do not want the property, so the points Dr. Hearne was making about the value for money are very valid.<\/p> <p>  We currently source money from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, and pillar banks in Ireland and we have shown that we can bring in very substantial pension funds, the biggest of which is a $1 trillion American pension fund that has been established for more than 100 years.  It is cheaper than us taking 25 year fixed money from the Housing Finance Agency.  On a scheme of 100 units, it would probably save the State more than &euro;5 million over a 25 year term.  No State equity is required.  It just pays the yield as a percentage of the capital is deployed, typically in a range of 3% to 5% a year.  These funds are not interested in rent inflation.  The only indexing they want is European harmonised inflation, typically around 1% a year.  Critically, they do not want the property at the end.  For a number of them, it is part of the ethical arrangement that it has to continue as social housing in perpetuity.

Deloitte is our auditor and its advice was there are ways around it.  It is operating successfully elsewhere in Europe.

Our social housing sector is half the size of the European average, which is about 17% and we are at less than 8% or 9%.  It was mentioned that the waiting lists could be opened up and a wider number of people could access public social housing.  That is one access.  What has happened in Ireland is people tend to go for schemes, like affordable schemes or cost rental schemes, which are trying to create mixed tenure.  They are the two options can be looked at: opening up the eligibility for waiting lists to higher income people, or new tenders.  It is not that complicated.  In our sector, we would be keen to house more people from medium and higher income households to give mixed tenures.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made comments about our capacity to meet the targets by 2021.  They are substantial, even though they are only a third of the overall targets.  We have land pressures.  We are talking to local authorities because we do not have a huge supply of land.<\/p><p>We believed that the land initiative could bring forward a supply of land, even the minimal requirement for social and affordable housing.  Everything is hodgepodge in terms of land assembly.  There is a bit here and a bit there.  It would be useful if there was one body that could co-ordinate land assembly for both local authorities and for our sector as well.  On finance, we have a couple of sources we did not have a couple of years ago.   The Housing Finance Agency is the dominant player for social housing and finance.  We also have other growing players in the market.  A lot of this is about learning.  As Mr. O'Connor has said, ethical investors are looking at our sector and are just looking for a return, not any complicated agendas about ownership, and so forth.  We have to reach out to that.  It is not any wider agenda.  If we can widen the spread of finance options by one or two that would be helpful to our supply.  Our pipeline at the moment is quite good for the next year or so.  After that, if there is no land, it will tail off.  We have relied a lot on turnkeys and on joint ventures.  That will continue, but both local authorities and our sector have an issue with land assembly and this debate is only happening in the last year or two, not three or four years.<\/p><p> On the private sector side, we are relying on nearly 5,000 homes coming through the private rental sector, the landlord sector.  We do not know what all their motivations are.  The one thing we like about social housing for local authorities in the housing associations is that the supply can be controlled because one has the non-profit motivation.  In the private landlord sector one cannot control that supply.  That is why we need to reverse here and get to that point of 17% or 18% of social housing as an objective.  Everything will fall from that.  In the next couple of years we are going to be pressurised with land supply and delivery.  We have a reasonable pipeline at the moment.

The broader point the Deputy is making is correct which is that we do need to consider how we are housing people.<\/p> <p>  The housing crisis is not one that has emerged out of nowhere and is not just the fault of this Government.  It is as a result of 30 years of not thinking about housing and how we treat it and what role it has in the economy and essentially handing it over to the market.  We need to understand again what role housing plays.  Across the board there are so many groups affected.   On the value for money issue and hard data, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did its own analysis of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and showed that in areas of high rental pressure that HAP is not good value for money in contrast to direct build.  Leasing is not going to be very different from that, as I showed in the costings there.<\/p> <p>  It would be interesting the ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come in and analyse these schemes because they did such analysis on schools and found that the schools were 8% to 13% more expensive.  This office could look at the public sector benchmark while retaining the commercial sensibility on it.  That is how they provide it.  <\/p> <p>  I did analysis of the original 2006-08 public private partnership social housing regeneration projects.  My analysis was that the State was giving developers essentially public land worth &euro;545 million.  In return the State was getting social housing and community facilities worth about &euro;250 million.  The developers in the private sector were capturing that value.  The issue is that the State does not put a value on the land it has.  The Department looks at social housing delivered through these various schemes as being Exchequer-neutral, not a cost, but that is not putting a proper value on the land, in my view.  <\/p> <p>  The other issue on risk-sharing of all PPPs globally is that when risks and problems materialise in PPP projects, it is always the State that has to pay for that risk, because it is the State that is responsible to deliver whatever the service is.  The private sector is aware of this and that is why they like these projects.  They are guaranteed income, no matter what happens.  It is important to see that the risk-sharing idea is a nonsense because in reality when risk materialises the State has to pay.<\/p> <p>  On a broader level on how we are responding, the question on the private market is a really good one.  We have to see that our housing system, I would argue, has gone through this shock and is fundamentally changed.  We now have a fifth of households in the private rental sector.  I asked a class off 80 students last week how many of them thought they would own their own home.  Approximately ten of them put up their hands.  We have a generation who are going to be in the private rented sector.  What we need to do is to change utterly how we see social housing.  We need to re-imagine social housing  and to change it to this idea of public affordable housing that is available, as in Denmark and Austria, to anybody on any income.  If we separate the social and affordable housing issue we have this constant problem of all these different issues.  I agree with Mr. Mc Manus, we need to see that it is not about tinkering around the edges.  We need in Ireland to move to providing a third of housing coming from the non-market, not-for-profit sector to some form of social or public affordable housing, housing associations or co-operatives.  Currently it is only 10%.  The reality, to address Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, is that the private sector will build.  It may build 30,000 units next year.  We know it will get nowhere near that but it will not build affordable housing.  That is the problem we have had over the past 30 years.<\/p> <p>  That is the change we need to make and it is a big change.  That is the scale of the change that is required if we are going to address the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rory Hearne"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":835,"content":"<p>Will we do one minute of quick-fire questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#T00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":836,"content":"<p>We have to leave, unfortunately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018111400002#T00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1542186000,"counter":837,"content":"<p>We have run completely over and I am sorry for that.

We are about sustaining rural communities that have people living in them who have jobs and that have a good balance of ages.  Our submission discusses micro and small and medium sized businesses in rural areas.  At another meeting last night, we were disturbed to hear that according to the Western Development Commission, WDC, there has been a decline in the development of small rural businesses by 4% in the past few years.  During a recession when jobs are hard found, one might expect more people would try to start a small business but these figures show that this was not the case.  The main factor is they cannot access capital.  In 2017, almost half the jobs created by IDA Ireland were located in the greater Dublin region.  We are not anti-Dublin and are not trying to create a divide, but that is a fact.<\/p> <p>  Just over 4,000 jobs were created in the midlands region, which is far short of the figure nationally, for example, but in other westerns and south-western regions, similar figures apply.  Jobs are not being created in these areas at the same speed as they are in the Dublin region.  Mircoenterprises account for most of the jobs in rural areas.  The issues which affect these enterprises are access to credit, high-speed broadband, which is a significant problem, the retention of staff and skilled workers, transport and the role of social enterprises.  <\/p> <p>  Over the past year, Irish Rural Link has established partnerships as part of an EU-funded project, which examined the barriers in rural Ireland to creating and sustaining microprojects.  Microprojects are the kind of small projects that might have between one and three people, and are dotted across the country and which rely on a broadband service.  Most people can work from home or from a small business, perhaps in a village, but they require broadband.  That report will be published shortly.  We will present it to all members here and to the European Commission on how we might try to retain jobs in rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Carbon tax is an issue.  Irish Rural Link members are not climate change deniers but we cannot sit around and watch people be penalised by way of such a tax.  There have been efforts to implement a carbon tax for the past three years.  According to the media, one would think that we do not have a carbon tax but we have had one since 2013 at 7 cent per litre, something which did not reduce emissions by even 0.01%.  The reason for that is that rural dwellers do not have a choice.  It is an issue that often arises for microbusiness as it impinges on the development of small business.  We hope the committee will support Irish Rural Link in asking the Government to call in the stakeholders so that Ireland can have its own climate summit and examine how we can decarbonise in a way that is based on a just transition, as former President, Mary Robinson, who is an active climatologist, advocates.  <\/p> <p>  We have said much about local public banking.  Ireland has committed to introducing vibrant, competitive banking.  Mario Draghi, who was in Dublin recently and appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, was clear that we should get on with that.  Irish Rural Link has put forward a proposal where there would be eight regional banks, each its own entity, which would complement all other financial institutions in the region, especially credit unions.  Previously, we had the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, and the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, which worked well.  There are thousands of farmers and shopkeepers across the country whose first loan came from the ACC and they developed their business from there.  <\/p> <p>  We introduced a particular model  because that is what one does when one seeks change, but we have told the Government parties to pick the model that they think works, as long as it is a community banking model.  Whoever wants to step up and take that on will be happy with that, but until then, the figures provided by the WDC will continue to the apply.  The bureaucracy involved in getting loans under the new regulation is such that by the time the loan is approved, or worse, appealed to the credit review committee, the idea will have passed and the cash flow is no longer a problem; it is a disaster.<\/p><p>We are simply stating, very strongly, that unless we manage to introduce a public banking system into the State we will consign rural Ireland to continually being underfunded and undercapitalised, unless somebody steps up and we invite all stakeholders in the business to step up to that process.<\/p><p> We have sent the committee a full submission on this, including the rebuttal to the report published in July.  I urge the members to read our rebuttal of the report that came from the Department of Finance in July.  I believe it will really educate the members.<\/p><p> On the issue of broadband, we hope there will be no reduction of commitment to the rolling out of broadband.  We are aware that it has hit a hurdle, to say the least.  Some public statements around the cost of broadband and the slow take-up of broadband are leading us down a road of spin, saying that if it costs so much and if rural people are not taking it up, we will not do it at all.  I hope that is not the intention of those who spin that story.  To be clear, broadband is not just essential; it is as essential as water and electricity.  Failure to deliver it will really leave us in the space where we are sending our young people to the major cities, and particularly the Dublin region, forever.  That is where we are going.  We in Irish Rural Link are very clear that even though we believe there is no plan B, if the report outlining the realities around broadband is negative, we need a plan B.  We urge this committee to not slack off.  The committee has been extremely supportive in calling for a proper broadband service in Ireland.<\/p><p> The whole issue of staff retention and skilled workers is important.  We need greater cohesion among the institutes of technology and we need a really strong educational link to ensure that skilled staff are retained in rural Ireland.  When one considers the competition, the reality is that the more competitive and higher paying jobs seem to be outside the various regions.  We have to be careful.  We need a strong policy from the Department of Education and Skills to ensure strong linkage between the institutes of technology and the various colleges in the regions to afford the best opportunity for people to get skilled up and to stay in the region.<\/p><p> Transport is a real issue.  We are extremely supportive of the LocalLink project.  Irish Rural Link was one of the many voices in the early days that supported the establishment of LocalLink.  Many people in rural areas do not have alternative transport apart from their cars.  This goes back to the carbon tax.  We need, and we have the opportunity, to start introducing innovative ways to ensure there is alternative transport.  Most pubs, shops and villages are dying as a result of poor transport facilities.  We really need to tackle this and it should be tackled at the summit I am calling for.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the issue of social enterprise.  Irish Rural Link is an umbrella body for many of the meals on wheels projects.  It also covers the wetlands project.  The wetlands offer an opportunity to bring the disused or used bogland into a situation where they can actually create jobs.  We have a very strong network set up.  It will look at biodiversity and how we can transform the used wetlands and bogland into a strong, educational source of knowledge where it can create jobs.  The Life Project on the midland bog, which we are part of, is creating jobs.  We could do a lot more of that.<\/p><p> With regard to the meals on wheels projects, we need to reform the way we do social enterprise.  As we speak there are groups of people travelling the boreens of Ireland to deliver meals to housebound people and to people recovering from surgery.  They do it at huge expense to themselves, often in a voluntary capacity.  There is no cohesion at all in how this is done.  It should be covered under community services or social enterprise programmes.  I urge the committee to look at a redefinition, especially in the social field, of what a social enterprise project is.  Older people, for example, want to live in their own homes but they need supports.  In many cases those supports are being supplied voluntarily, but there is no cohesion or structure to it.  If I find myself needing that help in a few years' time, and I am getting closer to it, I would like to think I am not just depending on the goodwill of volunteers in my area.  I would like to think there is a proper system in place so that when I need it I can get the support.  Most older people are really crying out for that support.<\/p><p> Finally, I commend the work of the committee and its members over the years.  It has done tremendous work.  I thank the Chairman for having Irish Rural Link appear before the committee and we will continue to advocate for the issues I have outlined, and many more.  I wish the members well in their deliberations today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boland.

It also provides a wide range of support services to them and to a growing number of credit unions throughout the State.  In its early days CUDA was the representative voice, on behalf of its owner member credit unions, with legislators and regulators.  It has since evolved and now, as well as providing a voice it is increasingly supporting credit unions in the areas of regulatory compliance, risk management, shared services and competency development.<br\/><br\/>Credit unions are always looking at how they can expand their range of loans and other services, and therefore I welcome the opportunity to attend the committee today to discuss how we can support individuals, small businesses and rural communities that this committee represents.<br\/><br\/>The recent report on public banking by the Department of Finance and the Department of Rural and Community Development states that evidence suggests that the supply of credit, both to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and retail customers is increasing.  The credit unions CUDA works with have experienced strong growth in credit, particularly for individuals but, as has been said before, we have billions of euro to lend, and we welcome the opportunity to work with this committee and with interested stakeholders to identify prudent ways in which we can deliver more for local communities.<br\/><br\/>In the previous debate on rural and community development in September Dr. Senan Cooke, author of the publication The Enterprising Community: A Bottom up Perspective on the Capacity within Communities to Regenerate, made the following comment:<\/p><blockquote>With regard to why schools turn things around, four individuals in Dunhill guaranteed a &euro;400,000 loan - &euro;100,000 each from their own pockets.  They went down to the credit union, borrowed the money, bought a field, built 40 homes for young families, saved the schools and created a new dynamic in the parish for business people.<\/blockquote> <p>While not knowing the specifics of that initiative, I am dubious that any of the banks would have offered funding for such a worthy plan.  This is an excellent example of credit unions' renowned community spirit and not-for-profit ethos in action.  The four individuals did guarantee parts of the loan, but the credit union, on behalf of all its members, ultimately took the risk in giving it as they clearly believed in their community and in supporting it.<br\/><br\/>In the same session, Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly, vice chairman of the Irish Local Development Network and CEO of North East-West Kerry Development, mentioned that credit unions were a key option when it came to providing credit to local SME&rsquo;s and sole-traders.  He said that some credit unions give out unsecured loans to farmers of up to &euro;50,000 and that they operate on a local basis.  We would be delighted to work with his organisation or any of the other rural or community-based organisation that support SME or individual lending at a community level, to expand the level and flexibility of credit that we currently offer.<\/p><p> CUDA has a vision for a credit union system that includes helping shape the society we want to live in through financial education and the provision of credit for small businesses and community purposes for the current and future generations.  This involves recognising talent and opportunity in all communities, rural and urban, and harnessing and supporting that talent with credit and financial advice for the betterment of communities and, indeed, credit unions.  In the 1950s, faced with massive youth unemployment, a group of people formed together around the idea that the solution to that crisis was co-operative self-employment.  However, there was no money available with which to start and grow businesses.  Speaking in 1982, Ms Nora Herlihy, one of the principal founders of the credit union movement in Ireland said &ldquo;[the] object in promoting the Credit Union idea was to show the people how to accumulate that money from their own savings and resources&rdquo;.<\/p><p> Some people fail to understand that credit unions have an interdependent relationship with their local communities and that they generate income, to reward savers, primarily through lending.  They cannot prosper by simply taking in deposits and avoiding lending risk.  To survive, they must take risk every day.  A key factor in mitigating that risk is a credit union&rsquo;s understanding of its local community.  We are not banks and, therefore, we approach things differently.   While we have procedures that must be followed and requirements that must be adhered to, when we are considering a loan application we prefer to become aware of potential community projects and-or local businesses ideas at an earlier stage to see how we can help and support those involved.  As we often say to such members, we have seen all scenarios play out with other borrowers and can often offer key financial advice or direct them to one of the many local community experts with whom we already have a relationship.<\/p><p> When it comes to finance, credit unions live by the phrase \"It&rsquo;s good to talk\".  Our doors are open to those that have ideas and want to make a difference.  That is not to say that we will automatically lend money to every venture or scheme - we will not - but credit unions will give local members the best opportunity and the best guidance we can give and are permitted to give.  Credit unions are expert at providing consumer loans, savings and payment facilities, loans to owner-managed businesses, a wide range of digital channels and digital engagement facilities and a green energy better home partnership.   We continue to seek a solution to enable credit unions to contribute to resolving the housing emergency and are well under way to deliver on other product and process solutions, including lending to small businesses and bringing extended current account related facilities to market.<\/p><p> We call on all stakeholders interested in sustaining small rural and community business to share with us any needs they have which they believe are not currently being met by credit unions.  We will factor them into our plans as we continue to expand services.  This applies specifically to credit related issues, where there may be regulatory obstacles, and we will include them in our submission to the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s currently open consultation on lending frameworks for credit unions.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its kind invitation, and I look forward to addressing any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":849,"content":"<p>The Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA, welcomes this opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development.  We welcome the interest of the committee members and hope that this is the commencement of dialogue on this very important topic.<\/p> <p>  CUMA is an association of credit union professional senior managers and CEOs drawn from credit unions in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.  Our members are front-line people drawn from all types of credit unions.  Our members are the people who, day-to-day, interact with the three million members of credit unions on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Credit Unions have a rich history of engaging in small business lending in Ireland.  It is not new to us.  Many small businesses that currently grace our communities had their inception in credit union funding and were sustained for many years by credit unions who helped in many ways, ranging from start-up funds to cashflow.  Small rural and community businesses are a natural fit for credit unions.  Indeed, all our credit unions are community businesses themselves.  All were once small, and many are still small.  After many years of adverse economic conditions, we still sustain and are resilient.  There are important lessons which can be drawn from that.<\/p> <p>  Our staff are drawn from our communities, and many of our volunteer directors are drawn from small rural and community businesses, the subject matter of today&rsquo;s discussion.  We profess to knowing a little bit about what we are talking about.  We are the largest and most successful co-operative on this island.  One of the things that makes us so different from the failed, profit driven banks is that we are not-for-profit organisations.  This is important in a cultural context.  Not only do we operate within legislatively controlled interest rates, but, as an indicator of that not-for-profit attitude and of our culture, we give back loan interest to our member borrowers.  According to Central Bank's most recent statistics, 72% of credit unions rebated an average of 10.2% of loan interest collected in financial year 2017.  Have the members ever heard a bank say that?  I cite this statistic to emphasise that the culture of credit unions is different, and that we look at things differently.  It is therefore only natural that we would understand what we are talking about and whose interest we are addressing.  It is in inherently in our interest that small businesses are resilient and that they survive and thrive.  We draw savings from our local communities and we lend in those same communities. We are the original crowd funders, and were operating long before that phrase was invented.<\/p> <p>  As mentioned earlier, we have a long history of small-business lending.  The economic downturn impacted this type of lending negatively.  Living in our communities, we saw small local businesses fail.  These failures, allied to restrictions preventing business lending placed by the Central Bank upon many credit unions, contributed to the depressed levels of business lending by credit unions.  Whereas some of these restrictions were relaxed in recent years, some still prevail.  The Central Bank of Ireland, which regulates credit unions, introduced additional regulations in 2016 that defined \"commercial loans&rdquo; and limited commercial lending to 50% of the credit union&rsquo;s regulatory reserve.  This is equivalent to approximately 5% of the overall assets of the credit union and depends upon whether a particular credit union holds the minimum reserve requirements.  As witness to how credit unions have actually sustained and improved, only three held less than the regulatory reserve in March 2018.  These have since been transferred into other credit unions.  Their offices remain open in their local communities, and have seen an increase in services available.<\/p> <p>  In March of 2018, commercial loans accounted for 1.9% of the existing &euro;4.5 billion credit unions have out on loan.  This is equivalent to 0.51% of our assets.  Given that we could be lending up to 5%, or more where higher regulatory reserves exist, under current regulations, there is considerable capacity in credit unions for greater levels of commercial lending in suitable circumstances.  It is somewhat disappointing to note that the Central Bank now proposes to impose further impediments to credit union lending in both unsecured personal lending and in the area of lending to small businesses.<\/p><p>That is for discussion another day, however.  Notwithstanding this consideration, credit unions are ever anxious to engage with members who own or are starting businesses locally.  Not only are we based in approximately 500 locations, but decisions are made locally and in a timely manner.<\/p><p> It is important for rural communities that a culture of mutual sustainability prevails.  Credit unions must and do support local people and local communities.  Despite wholesale mergers of credit unions over the past two years, the number of credit union branches has remained constant, but local people must support and borrow from their local credit union branches.  Community organisations would see a faster and more viable return from supporting credit union development than from advocating entry of another foreign bank into rural Ireland.<\/p><p> Presence on the part of multi-service credit union offices is important for towns and villages in rural Ireland.  Not only must we be enabled to offer business lending more easily and in a less-restricted manner, but we have to be enabled to offer a wider range of face-to-face services.  Such a range of services will attract more footfall to our towns and villages, with consequent spin-off for neighbouring businesses.<\/p><p> We are pleased that for four years in a row credit unions have been voted number one for customer experience in the CXi Ireland customer experience report.  This is a tribute to the member-centric nature of credit unions and to our 4,000 staff members spread throughout urban and rural Ireland.<\/p><p> We see the debate at this committee to be much-needed and long overdue.  We see it as a commencement.  We welcome engagement with Oireachtas Members and with the community of interests in rural and, indeed, urban Ireland.  I thank the committee for its time and consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Molan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting the Irish League of Credit Unions to attend.  We are a volunteer-led, democratic, all-island co-operative movement.  We represent 250 credit unions located in 500 different, separate communities in the Republic.  As a result of the fact that our organisation is membership-based, we are of the community; because we are democratic, we represent the community; and because we are local and because each credit union is a co-operative of savers and borrowers bound in a common bond, decisions are made in the community by members who know and understand their own needs.<\/p> <p>  What makes credit unions fundamentally different is our ethos.  We have a holistic view of community.  Banks look out on the world and see market segments.  They seek to make profits and to enrich shareholders.  We come from the community, we see the needs around us and we understand that one need is joined up with another.  Sustaining small rural and community business is part of being able to sustain small communities for the future.  There is no community without business, without jobs, and without the services and opportunity that comes with a strong, sustainable economic life locally.  Credit unions are not for profit.  We are financially strong and we are prudent.  The return we seek is stronger communities and our members' well-being.  That obviously includes small and medium businesses locally.<\/p> <p>  In a world of globalisation and homogenisation there is consolidation among credit unions.  There is also a continued enhanced level of service provided by credit unions in the more than 500 separate communities I spoke of.  Due to the fact that we are membership-based and co-operative, we have values that banks do not.  As a result of our common bond, we are a real community of members saving together and lending to one another.  A mark of our values is that for the fourth year in a row Irish credit unions have taken first place in the annual CXi customer experience awards, which were announced on 16 October.  Customer experience is measured by how customers perceive an organisation&rsquo;s brand through their interactions with its employees.  The fact that credit unions are the only organisation in the world to win this accolade in four consecutive years speaks for itself.  We have values of excellence that enable us relate to the community at every level, from the smallest personal micro-loan to lending to business.<\/p> <p>  The economic facts relating to SMEs speak for themselves.  Data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that there were approximately 250,000 active enterprises in Ireland in 2016.  As our colleagues from Irish Rural Link said earlier, more than 90% of these had fewer than ten employees.  These are our so-called microenterprises.  Just under 7% had between ten and 49 employees.  These are the small enterprises in SME terms.  Some 1.2% had between 50 and 249 employees and are medium-sized enterprises, while only 0.2% are large enterprises with 250 or more employees.  Small enterprises or microenterprises account for a huge proportion of Irish businesses.<\/p> <p>  Credit unions know these people because they are our members.  We have 3 million members.  We provide for their personal loans and we want to do more to provide for business lending too.  That is why we published the league&rsquo;s SME funding proposal, which was forwarded to the committee.  Lending to business is not simply an issue we are speaking of here today.  It is an issue we have prioritised for some time.  It is intrinsic to the range of services credit unions seek to offer.  The league&rsquo;s proposal is predicated on credit unions having a real concern to assist small business and micro-business.  I understand that this committee fully shares that community perspective because that is its remit.  Although we are talking primarily about rural communities today, it is important that the remit of the committee and that of credit unions fully includes urban communities as well.<\/p> <p>  Our proposal is essentially that credit unions would participate in a State-backed vehicle that would enable individual credit unions to act as an efficient distribution network to originate SME loan applications.  It would enable credit unions to invest in a funding facility that would then lend to SMEs.  Our proposition is that this structure be formed on a collective basis.  We believe that this should be piloted with a small pool of well-capitalised, large credit unions.  The key benefit of our proposal is that it would enable credit unions to put a portion of the members&rsquo; excess funds of approximately &euro;10 billion, currently held in short-term and low-yield investments, to a more productive and economically rewarding purpose.  It would also enable credit unions to offer members a more diversified and dynamic product offering.  If an SME approached a credit union for a commercial loan, while that credit union might not offer the loan or take direct risk on the loan, it could direct the application to a entity associated with the credit union which could consider the credit and potentially offer the loan to the SME borrower.<\/p> <p>  Providing the SME sector with necessary supports to foster a culture of growth is an essential public policy focus.  Our proposal would enable the sector to access, on a community basis, a strong sustainable, well-capitalised and domestically managed funding source.  In addition, this proposal would open up the credit union infrastructure as a key SME loan distributor.  Credit unions could act as a new conduit for the State to stimulate borrowing in the SME market and support it with competitive loans in a speedy and effective manner using the credit unions pre-existing and mature infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  We are also meeting today in a specific political context.  The confidence and supply agreement has concluded.  The Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, review process is concluding and credit unions are now looking for a move onward from aspiration to action.  The commitment to &ldquo;develop a strategy for the growth and development of the credit union sector&rdquo; in the confidence and supply agreement is long in gestation. The challenge now, which is essentially political, is to translate kind words of reassurance into political prioritisation.  The challenge credit unions face in terms of the development of more localised banking and financial services, which we are ambitious to lead, is not the result of any lack of good will.  It is down to the much scarcer commodity of determined prioritisation.<\/p> <p>  Credit unions have been moving on.<\/p><p>For example, among other things, credit unions now process electronic payments and issue mortgages.  With regard to the provision of microcredit, the \"It Makes Sense\" loan was launched two years ago and we welcome the report published this morning seeking an interest rate cap on moneylenders.  There are more than 6,000 live loans in 110 credit unions in 260 locations.  These are significant and welcome developments but the scale of what we can do is severely restricted by regulation.  Our aim is to deliver current accounts and debit cards, and support our members with the full range of services they need on a day-to-day basis.<\/p><p> All of these pending issues impact on our capacity to meet the needs of businesses locally and, more generally, the needs of the communities we come from.  We are ambitious to deliver more lending for SMEs and family farms.  We are ready to invest in social housing as asked by Government.  We are delivering in partnership with the Government on an effective microlending scheme.  We are ready with a detailed proposal on how credit unions can better deliver for SMEs.  There is, however, a gap politically between aspiration and engagement.  We do not look at communities and see market segments but, in turn, we need holistic engagement on policy that is backed up by joined-up regulation to deliver a step change for credit unions.  This step change is not about us as a movement.  Credit unions are an instrument of change, not its objective.  Instead, we see the communities we come from, we see the more we can do and we are ambitious to do it.  I thank committee members for their time and we look forward to answering their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":853,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from Irish Rural Link and the credit unions and I thank them for their presentations.  I concur with much of what Mr. Boland has said on the problems we face in rural Ireland and the problems that farmers and SMEs face in accessing funds to expand their businesses and provide employment.  It is sad to hear that the creation of jobs in rural areas is in decline but we already knew it.  I know of one school on the Iveragh Peninsula where only two new children presented this year for enrolment.<\/p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly with the comments on the carbon tax.  It does little and hurts people in rural areas.  We all know about the cost of fuel.  The price of diesel has increased to more than &euro;1.50 a litre and petrol is also expensive.  We cannot move anywhere in rural Ireland without a car and that is a fact.  The provision of rural transport and service expansion is not happening; rather it is declining.  A few months ago, the Minister, Deputy Ross, stated he would provide transport and expand services in rural places but this is not happening.  There are eight services in Kerry.  To explain how the Government boosts up things and tries to gain credit for what it is doing, one of these services is to take a group of card players from Cloghane to Brandon once a month.  This is what the Government boasted about.  It is ridiculous to think such a service is provided in return for what is being taken from the people.  People in rural areas are hurting because of all the restrictions and regulations.<\/p> <p>  When we think about increasing the carbon tax and the effect this has, if we were to be totally emissions free in this country 0.13% is all the difference it would make in the worldwide context.  We see people in Japan and China who cannot see their noses with fog and smog and every other thing.  They are not complying with any agreement or climate change proposal.  We are a small little country.  It is especially hurting rural areas, when we think of Bord na M&oacute;na having to shed 500 jobs in the heart of the country.  In a few more years it will be totally closed down.  There are no proposals to replace these jobs.  Bord na M&oacute;na said it knew it was coming down the line for the past six or seven years.  What proposals are being put in place to replace these jobs?  It is amazing to think that Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party and many others are backing these proposals and saying nothing about the 500 jobs being lost.  If it happened in any other part of the world there would be uproar in the Chamber.  Everyone has agreed on climate change and the penalisation that must take place and Bord na M&oacute;na set about it.  Perhaps someone besides myself raised the matter of losing 500 jobs in the heart of our country.  Down in Kerry people are concerned when they see what is happening.  They know it will not be too long before they will not be allowed to cut a sod of turf to keep themselves warm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#G00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":854,"content":"<p>Very true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#G00300","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":855,"content":"<p>At the same time, energy costs are rising and there is no problem in getting people to pay.

The doors in small towns and villages will be shut, the windows will be falling in and the roofs will be falling down and people will be wondering what is happening to rural Ireland.  It is happening under our noses.  People in rural areas are finding it difficult to survive with all of the regulations.<\/p> <p>  It is amazing to think the credit unions are before the committee because they want to expand their services and offer more face-to-face services to people while at the same time our pillar banks, which the Government for one reason or another supports through thick and thin and it does not matter a damn they broke the country eight or ten years ago, are going the other way.  The credit unions want to offer face-to-face services to local people while the banks are putting boxes in the corners.  There is no such thing now as meeting a bank manager.  He or she is up in Dublin and the person one speaks to about accessing a loan must write to Dublin and then the response comes back that one is refused.<\/p> <p>  The banks employ a firm of solicitors to demand more information from the person seeking the loan even though he or she might be looking for only &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 to improve or expand the business or employ another person.  Who is paying for this?  The credit unions want to offer more services but they are being denied and held back by the Central Bank.  This is what I believe.  In the context of saving our local post offices we have been asking that a form of community banking be made available.<\/p><p>This is operating successfully in many other countries.  Germany, which is one of the most efficient and prosperous countries, has more community-led banks than pillar banks.  They are operating very successfully, but our Government will not listen to our request to provide community banking in the local post office.  It would prefer to close all the post offices down.  This is a service that has existed since the foundation of the State and more than half of them are closed.  In the next two or three years half of them will be closed and a post office in a village or small town will be a thing of the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#G00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":857,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to conclude on that point because other members want to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#H00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":858,"content":"<p>Certainly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#H00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I will invite him to come in again, but I need to go around to the rest of the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#H00400","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses.

I was particularly interested in what Mr. Boland had to say.  He spoke about the lack of transport in rural areas.  He spoke about broadband, carbon tax and meals on wheels.<\/p> <p>  As I see it rural Ireland is dying on its feet.  The recent proposals by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and passed by the D&aacute;il were the final nail in the coffin for many businesses in rural areas.  Many public houses are in very serious trouble and their survival is in doubt.  It has only come to light in the past month since the new regulations have come in.  It has had catastrophic consequences.  I am getting phone calls from business people who are now in serious trouble and from individuals who used to like a little social outing and are finding it difficult.<\/p> <p>  I attended a 60th birthday party at Ballineen about two weeks ago.  The people who were there were conscious that they had to go somewhere the next day and were worried about having a drink or two the night before.  There is complete confusion.  The transport that the Minister, Deputy Ross, was offering the people was only a farce and a cod because nobody has anybody transport.  The people are completely dependent on taxis.  The problem is the next morning or whatever.  It is a very serious issue and has led to closures.<\/p> <p>  Another pub in west County Cork, The Welcome Inn west of Bandon, has closed.  It has been there for decades.  It is not just pubs.  It has a knock-on effect on many other aspects in rural areas.  It is very difficult for politicians to find a solution for that because the Government and the previous one have been very focused on being anti-rural.  We are trying to bring a focus to the difficulties of rural Ireland.  It does not have to be the drink-driving issue; there are many issues.  We need a real focus on rural Ireland that we cannot get from Government.<\/p> <p>  We have the same situation with broadband.  We are slipping down a very dangerous road with broadband.  That slippage has been evident for the past two or three years with the national broadband plan continually being put off.  Eir is rolling out here and there whenever it suits it.  No one in government has control over what is going on from what I can see.  The plan could well be pulled off the pitch completely.  That is a worst-case scenario, but it looks like we could be heading there.  Sometimes I wonder if they are looking for an excuse so that they could do that.<\/p> <p>  While Eir and other companies may be providing broadband to villages, they must realise that the private operator is most likely supplying all around that village and is depending on the village to keep his business going.  If these guys keep taking the rich pickings, the private operator will pull the plug and we will face a catastrophic situation.  Whereas people might now be complaining about the little bit of broadband they have, but they could end up with no broadband at all for the next two or three years.  That is a very serious issue that is not being addressed.<\/p> <p>  I will not mention much about the carbon tax.  We are being pushed down a very serious road.  Those of us who live in rural Ireland need our vehicles to go and come.  We do not have a proper public transport service.  From the peninsula where I live the bus leaves at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. and comes back at 6 p.m.  There is no other transport service to allow people to commute during the day and they desperately depend on a car to get around.<\/p> <p>  I have a hands-on involvement with the meals-on-wheels project in my community.  We have been very lucky that Citro&euml;n Ireland gave us a van through Denis and Mary Ryan in car sales in west Cork and down in Schull on the Mizen Peninsula.  We have tried to tie that up with rural social workers and other CE schemes in order to get workers and volunteers because it is a very serious thing.  Mr. Boland is right that there is no major co-ordination and it needs to be tied down because it is a lifeline for many elderly people.<\/p> <p>  I know many people who swore they would never have it and they would be dead only for having that dinner.  It is so important for elderly people, especially those living on their own to have a hot dinner in the day because it is easy to supplement the morning and the evening after that.  That service needs greater recognition right up along the line because in the long term it is saving the State a considerable amount of money.  I accept that the HSE is on board, but there is only so much it can do.  It has been a great help to rural communities with the section 39 funding for chefs, etc., in the community centres.  Getting the dinners out to the little boreens throughout the country is so important.  I commend Citro&euml;n Ireland on giving us a van for that.  We cover a wide area in the peninsula and it goes around from door to door.<\/p> <p>  There is no greater place than the credit unions for me to send people who are in need of a little bit of a financial boost or a loan.  I have done that more frequently of late with the people going for cataract, knee, hip and carpal tunnel operations through the cross-border healthcare directive.  We have a list of about 200 people looking to get surgery.  Of those 200 up to 80 or 90 might ask me for help do deal with the funding.  They obviously have to pay upfront.  They can forget about banks and I send them to the credit union.  In 99.9% of the cases the credit union has delivered.  I have nothing but praise for the credit unions across the board.  They have been fantastic to people.  It is just a case of going in the door and explaining the situation.  Some people do not like using the term \"bridging loan\", but it is basically a bridging loan and three months later the money is repaid to the credit union.  It has helped people to take that journey because the journey is long enough going up from Kerry, Cork or wherever.  A bus is going up this weekend and next weekend.  I cannot get enough buses up there.  That would not work were it not for the credit union working with the public.<\/p> <p>  The credit unions have 3 million members and this is expanding.  There is one negative.  One bank in west County Cork had an unfortunate situation.  Eight businesses in west County Cork have closed in the past six to eight weeks and The Welcome Inn west of Bandon is the ninth.  Drimoleague post office was providing a service a few days a week, but it is now being closed, which is very serious for the people of Drimoleague who are drawing up a petition to overturn that decision.  Skibbereen credit union made that decision which may have been for very good reasons.  I am pleading with the witnesses to look at the Bantry and Dunmanway branches to see if it might come in and save it.<\/p><p>Like many other rural towns in Ireland, Drimoleague has experienced the most devastating closures over the years.  As the song says, sometimes people must do it for themselves, and the people in Drimoleague have certainly done that.  In fairness to Cork County Council, it recently did a fabulous resurfacing job and one could nearly eat one's dinner off the street without a plate.  On top of that, a grant for painting the town was given, and every house and business in the town has been redecorated.  The town is turning itself around and it needs a credit union.  <\/p><p> If leaving Castletownbere, Bantry, Schull, the Sheep's Head Peninsula or wherever, some 99% of people will go through Drimoleague.  It is a branch that should be open every day of the week because it would pick up customers every day.  I come from a peninsula where the bank was shut and where people depend on a travelling bank that turns up a couple of days a week but they are not sure if it will be open.  I ask for that region to be considered.  I accept that the Irish League of Credit Unions wrote back to me to say it is looking into the matter but the people of Drimoleague are desperate for that decision to be overturned.  It sends a negative message at a difficult time.  Many businesses are closing but the credit union was never expected to be one of them.  I ask that the decision be reconsidered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#H00600","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":863,"content":"<p>The comments made by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae echo the meetings we have had around the country.  As I said, we are not climate deniers as an organisation.  At the Hodson Bay Hotel in July this summer, we brought in 250 people who were looking for ways and means to refit their homes to move into the next stage of modernity.  There is a hunger out there.  We are calling strongly for a proper discussion and summit rather than putting it in through the budgetary mechanism.  As I said on the radio to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the adults should be brought into the room to have a proper discussion about the matter.  I concur with the Deputy, therefore, in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins spoke articulately about the closure of services.  Irish Rural Link has said time and again that it is concerned with sustainable rural communities, that is, communities with people living in them.  People cannot live in rural communities if the financial mechanisms are no longer there.  If there is no financial or economic hub in the area, people will move.  I know that from the experience of my family, of whom more are working in Dublin than at home in the midlands.  The area to which the Deputy refers requires that financial hub, which we believe will be provided by the public bank we are proposing.  It will provide that impetus as an alternative bank.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of post offices, as the Deputy will know, we have had reviews but we are stuck with a situation where post offices are not used as much by the public as they used to be.  That may be a function of the public leaving the area, and one may be leading to the other.  We need to know how to retain what is another financial segment in that community.  When a post office is lost, a financial segment in the area is also lost and, therefore, the issue requires serious consideration.  <\/p> <p>  We in Irish Rural Link are talking about restoring an economic hub.  I draw the committee's attention to the recently announced 2040 strategy.  The framework is there, and it was launched by the current Government in Sligo.  We need to honour that framework and do what it says.  It goes back to the Buchanan report in the 1960s, which was about creating financial and economic hubs in regions, rather than centralising it in one place such as Dublin.  <\/p> <p>  I concur with many of the points raised and I thank members for their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Boland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I would like to respond to Deputy Michael Collins's point.  To be fair to him, he raised the Drimoleague closure with us approximately one month ago.  We contacted the credit union in Skibbereen, which is the anchor credit union, and we are still engaging with it.<\/p> <p>  The credit union movement has prided itself on closing almost no branches.  While the banks have all but departed the country towns and villages, we would prefer if we could say none of the credit unions has closed.  Drimoleague is one of a handful but, from the Deputy's point of view, it is the wrong location for a closure.  Skibbereen has kept its Bandon office open, while Bantry has re-opened and allowed the Castletownbere office to remain open, which was also under pressure.  I commit to the Deputy that we will engage with the Drimoleague and Bantry credit unions to see if there is any triangular solution.  There are security and technical communication issues with the broadband, as we have discussed, as well as the old-fashioned viability issues.  Credit unions are not for profit but they must still take in enough income to pay for the low level of costs.  They are run by volunteers but there are also staff members in most of the branches who must be paid.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins and some of his colleagues brought the whole cross-Border issue to our attention approximately a year ago.  Credit unions were happy to step in and help those people make those long-distance journeys, which in his case were from west Cork and Kerry to one particular hospital in Belfast.  Many people have had operations which would not have happened as quickly without the Deputy and his colleagues, and without the credit unions giving those modest short-term loans, although they are not modest if they are needed to have a long-awaited operation done.  <\/p> <p>  We might engage offline on the other matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>On micro-enterprises and small enterprises, it is important not only to talk about getting financial support but also the whole area of infrastructure and support for them.

Instances of this are found around the Border in preparation for Brexit and so on.  All of these supports are delivered through the pillar banking system.  Due to the sheer number of credit unions, it is easier to deliver the supports through smaller distribution mechanisms, as happens in the three or four pillar banks.  They are areas to which additional engagement between the credit union movement as a whole, the Government and our colleagues in the communities could bring practical advancement, but there is definitely a need.  People who start out in local and micro-enterprise are brave but greater support is needed for them.  Although money is a big part of it, it is not the only thing they need.

To even get meals on wheels onto the hospital discharge plan in order that it is in place for people the day after they come out of hospital would be a good step and would help to prevent the readmission of people into hospital.<\/p> <p>  One other issue that also is constantly raised with us is the T&uacute;s scheme because people are only allowed on it for a year.  When that year is up they are off the scheme so not only do they not have a job to go to but the meals on wheels service also is down a body.

It is critical that we address that, get the broadband plan back on track and roll it out to the communities, farms, businesses and individuals in order that they can live in, work in and visit rural areas.

They have a large community services programme, which they hope to expand.  They serve all of south-east Clare and even go into mid-Clare in the general area of Clarecastle and Sixmilebridge.  They have made an application for the rural regeneration fund.  As the witnesses will be aware, it is part of the Project Ireland 2040 document.  That particular fund of &euro;1 billion will unlock the potential of villages such as Newmarket-on-Fergus and provide a vital service to the public in doing so and please God they will be successful in that application.  I note the proposal that it should be more streamlined and should move away from the <i>ad hoc<\/i>nature of meals on wheels operations.<\/p><p>I note that Deputy Michael Collins referenced his local service that is doing wonderful work, as is being done in Newmarket-on-Fergus.  There may be a need to streamline it and put proper structures in place in order that these meals on wheels operations do not grow organically but are provided as services for particular regions.  I noted Ms Lennon's point on discharge from hospitals and it makes absolute sense that if a person is being discharged from hospital and has no family support or neighbours, it makes life a lot easier if a meal could be delivered to the house because there is also a personal interaction with the person bringing in the meal.  That is an issue that we should definitely look into.<\/p><p>I note Mr. Johnson's point regarding Dr. Senan Cooke.

Dr. Cooke presented in a forthright manner that day and he and his organisation are an example.

What we are making very clear is that this is a bank.  It is not-for-profit and has been developed on an Irish model.  We are using the Sparkassen model as an example but we have asked the Department of Finance to look at how that model could be managed in an Irish context.  That is why the stakeholders forum, which has been agreed by the Department and on which I believe Irish Rural Link and the credit unions would sit, should seek to examine how the model would look.  I would strongly welcome the input of the credit union movement.<\/p> <p>  Irish Rural Link has made clear from day one that we do not see this proposal as in any way dampening the remit of the credit union movement, and nor should it.  The credit unions could be very much part of this.  I note the proposal made by Mr. Farrell this morning that a number of credit unions come together.  We are clearly stating that the current banking model is not working, specifically for businesses in rural areas, as the banks will admit.  For example, at a recent European financial forum the banks basically stated that larger accounts bring in more money, which makes sense, whereas a local partnership employing a few people is a much greater risk for them.  In the days of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, and the Industrial Credit Corporation, ICC, the banks effectively allowed these two entities to manage those sectors of the market.  In other words, we had a similar model previously when the ACC and ICC operated.  They no longer exist and we now have a vacuum which needs to be filled.  Perhaps the credit unions could do that but one thing is certain, namely, we need an alternative, not-for-profit public banking system.  We have offered the Sparkassen model as an example.  It is up to the Government and the people of Ireland to decide whether to implement that model or choose another model.  That is our position.  As I stated, our plan provides a specific model for each of eight regions.  Each bank would cater for a population of 250,000 and they would all link into existing financial institutions as well.  <\/p> <p>  There would not compete with the banks but addressing a niche market.  As the Western Development Commission has shown, the number of small businesses in the west had declined by 4%.  That is a problem and we cannot ignore the ongoing decline in small business formation.  The issues are linked.  Every year, the report of the Credit Review Office shows that loans are being consistently refused and the rate of refusal is the highest in Europe.  Figures from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, show a 36% refusal rate, while other figures show a rate of 11%.  Even the conservative figure of 11% is still the highest in Europe, higher than in Greece and other countries that are in serious trouble.  We cannot allow that to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I suggest that the committee ask the Minister when the stakeholder forum will take place and who will sit on it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#L00300","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":874,"content":"<p>We will raise that matter with the Minister.

What we are talking about is financial services.  It is very important to go back to the issue of sustainability.  To sustain, it is not possible to be just a one trick pony in respect of financial services.  There has to be a balanced portfolio and it has to meet the balance of needs in a rural community.  This balance of needs includes micro-lending, small and medium enterprise lending and lending for personal needs.  Personal needs include home improvement which sustains other micro-industries and small businesses in the form of builders, etc., that form part of the community.<\/p> <p>  We hope we are talking about having sustainable financial services located in local communities.  There will be a spin-off.  If 1,000 or 2,000 people are dealt with in an office in the course of a week, they will buy a newspaper and whatever else that needs to be bought in the shop next door.  A balance must be struck.  Returning to my earlier point, one issue is being missed here.  My colleague spoke about the high level of refusals and so forth.  These are symptoms, rather than causes.  The causes include the insufficient assistance available to enterprise and new business.  There are wonderful local enterprise offices, LEOs, and whatever else out there.  One practical step would be to have more joined up conversations between those who have members' savings that we want to lend out and those who can enable enterprising individuals to go in a particular direction.  In the next week and until the end of January, we will see significant public accountability in halls around the country when the credit unions hold their annual general meetings.  It will be shown that all of us are governed by volunteer directors such as Mr. Murphy who are elected on behalf of members.  I respectfully suggest that we already have local public financial services organisations.  They are willing to get in and do the job.  We also have staff and infrastructure in place and another difference is that, unlike some other financial institutions whose arrival was heralded some years ago but whose departure was perhaps less signalled, credit unions do not go away.  The banks are a little like migratory swallows in that they sometimes come back, but at least swallows have consistency.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Molan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":876,"content":"<p>My response to Senator Grace O'Sullivan is consistent with what Mr. Molan just said.

As my colleagues noted, people have also endorsed the customer experience by giving credit unions a rating of four out of a possible four, making them the number one.  It is clear that people want, like and respect the credit union model.  We contend that we have the model and if it is not complete, it is certainly more than the foundations.  We also have the capital and we must ensure we use it effectively rather than watch it erode.  We need to be allowed to reach out.<\/p><p>There are a couple of dimensions when we look at the core elements of banking and the culture of credit unions.  One of them is reliability.  As Mr. Molan just said, credit unions have been going from strength to strength over the last 50 odd years.  While occasionally we might get something wrong, we always act in the best interest of the members who are both the owners and consumers.  Credit unions act with honesty.<\/p><p> The challenge and possibly the gap that we have is one of competence.  We are seeing greater collaboration on the credit union side to try to find viable ways to expand the services.  As I stated, we urge all stakeholders to engage with us if they believe there are services that credit unions are not providing resulting in some perception of a vacuum.  We need to understand that and will very happily include it in our plans.  If there are obstacles, for example, regulations designed for another purpose, they will be considered.  An open consultation has just commenced on lending frameworks for credit unions.  This is a great opportunity to address any gaps that may exist.  We would be very happy to engage with interested stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Johnson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":878,"content":"<p>Going back to the Chairman's question, we sent our proposal to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about two years ago.  We had a number of meetings with officials and the Department recommended that we engage  with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Over a six-month period, we had a number of very positive meetings with it at which we discussed the pilot to which I referred.  All of a sudden, the SBCI got cold feet and we no longer met.  Any influence this committee might have on the Department or the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland would certainly be welcome.  We have been looking to do more in that space, including centrally managed lending, which would be more risk-proofed than the bigger loans going to the individual credit unions that might not have much experience in that sort of lending.<\/p> <p>  On the public banking side, going back to the Senator's question, we all agree that we do not want to bring a German model to Ireland if we already have a model here that is working but could do more, whether that is the post offices or the credit unions.  About a year ago, the credit unions in the midlands showed good faith and, with Deputy Penrose and Irish Rural Link, they met representatives of the Sparkassen to elicit advice on SME lending and see if they would come here.  On the night, they indicated they would not necessarily open a bank but they were available for guidance.  Again, that showed good faith that we are ready to try to do more.  From the point of view of Irish Rural Link, it was the rural communities but we said there are communities and demand in urban areas as well.  Certainly whether it was via a Sparkasse SME model or via the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, money, credit union offices and staff are available to step in and do more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I will ask the clerk to liaise with Mr. Farrell to get more detail.

Some of them have midland accents so I feel at home in this committee for the first time in a while.  It is great to see.  I am absolutely clear, notwithstanding comments coming from some credit union quarters, that a public banking model is not in opposition to or undermining of the credit union movement.  I applaud credit unions and work for and support them.  I have sent many customers their way both to invest and, more particularly, to borrow.  I thank the credit unions for treating people as people and for extending leniency on time periods, sometimes to enable distressed people to remain in their homes.  The compassion they have shown has manifested itself with very little in terms of bad debts.  That is most impressive considering they are dealing with many people who, like me, come from a lower socio-economic background.  I am proud to come from that background.<\/p> <p>  For the short time I was in government, before I got a bit chirpy, provision was being made for bad debts of up to &euro;1 billion in the credit unions.  I remember that very well.  I think the actual figure across the sector was less than &euro;100 million and there were a couple of large credit unions involved, as well as various matters other than bad debts.  There was no collapse of the credit union movement.  There are approximately 500 branches across the country that are doing well.  Some have amalgamated.  In Mr. Farrell's area of Kinnegad the credit union is being operated from Mullingar, which is grand.  There is no problem as long as there is one.  That &euro;100 million contrasts with the &euro;32 billion that was put on people's backs to save the pillar banks.  I want to see something in opposition to the banks, not the credit unions, because they are still getting away with nobody being made accountable for anything.  Even today, I will present a case to AIB.  It irritates and angers me as I come towards the end of my political life to see all this happen.  That is why I want to make sure there is something left behind.<\/p> <p>  We adopted the public banking model as Labour Party policy at our recent conference.  I do not see any problem with the model Mr. Johnson was speaking about.  There is no need to be defensive, if I perceive any defensiveness there.  We went to Mullingar and spoke to Sparkassen representatives.  The Sparkassen model would have to be modified and adapted for Ireland, that is clear.  We are Paddies and we have our way of going on.  As the former Taoiseach said, the Paddies and the Bridies want to know what is going on.  We do it our own way.  I know that.  All we want is some mentoring on how things work.  The Sparkassen saved Germany, let us not forget that.<\/p> <p>  We are still coming out of the recession.  A lot of people might be going around with big cravats and smoking cigars again but a terrible number of people are just making enough to have a dinner today and pay the mortgage and car loan.  Many of these car loans are from the credit unions, thankfully.  Without the credit union, I would not have a car.  The big problem I have with the credit unions, though, is the 8% rate charged for personal loans.  I tore lumps off the banks here so I had better be consistent and have a small side swipe at the credit unions about that.  I only got a loan the other day and I got it very efficiently and effectively with Tom Allen and the boys in Mullingar.  Maybe it is all right for me but I would ask the credit unions to look at that 8% interest rate.  I think I am right, although I may be wrong.  Everyone belonging to me is in the credit union so we are a mixed bag in that regard.  I do not think there is any need for that interest rate.<\/p> <p>  Mario Draghi appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach recently.  In response to questions concerning the high interest rates charged by banks in Ireland, he said these rates were the result of the quasi-monopoly - his words - enjoyed by the banks due to a lack of competition in the market.  That is why we need this.  It is not to take on the credit unions but to work with them.  The credit union could be a model but some adaption would be needed.<\/p> <p>  I am an agriculture spokesperson and know a bit about agriculture coming from that background, as would Mr. Farrell.  A &euro;50,000 unsecured loan would be great.  Any farmer in Kinnegad or out by Clonfad or Dalystown would be delighted to get that amount.  However, it may not be enough.<\/p><p>One would only be able to buy the wheels of a forestry harvester for &euro;50,000.  When I became involved in agriculture 40 years ago in 1979, it was a different job.  I do not support the use of those monstrous machines but that is neither here nor there.  The &euro;50,000 loan is a start.  The mortgage available is approximately &euro;100,000.  Even in a small village such as Ballinacarrigy with only 300 residents, one would not get a house for that price.  Mr. Farrell knows that village nearly as well as I do.  A great start has been made and I applaud the witnesses for that.  One must also consider savers.  It is a typically Irish attitude to want loans at low rates and to complain when the interest on savings is only 1% or 1.5%.  I agree that there must be a balance.  We have to cop on and tell people they cannot have their loaf and eat it.  I am in favour of a balanced contribution.<\/p><p> The level of regulation by the Central Bank is unacceptable.  It did not regulate sufficiently when things went wild but - typical Ireland - it now regulates everything out of existence with far too much bureaucracy.  The dead hand of bureaucracy is making sure credit unions cannot offer debit cards, current accounts and so on.  Representatives of the credit unions were before the committee on that issue long ago.  They want a widening of the services they can offer but are being deterred and restricted.  We should call a spade a spade.  As I stated in public, the Department of Finance is at least partly responsible.  It holds shares in the pillar banks and will allow nothing to delay the return on its investment.  That is what this is about.  If the credit unions widen their offering of services, the 3 million bank customers might go to a credit union rather than a private public bank and the Department would lose out.  I know this because I first proposed the reduction in bankruptcy terms contained in the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Act.  Mother of God, trying to get it through the House was difficult.  The Department was worried that the pillar banks would have to write off money.  It did not mind that people were slipping across to Wales or up beyond Ballyconnell where one could exit bankruptcy after a year.  As Ivan Yates said, as long as such people sat drinking coffee for the year they could return without issue.  This is a joke.  The dead hand of bureaucracy is holding back the credit unions and an exploration of the wider public banking model.  Irish Rural Link, credit unions, managers such as Mr. Farrell and other organisations and parties should meet in the stakeholder forum to outline what does not work here.  Of course, the public banking model might not work but it could be modelled and adapted.  Credit unions are not banks, but unless they adopt some sort of banking philosophy, the pillar banks will keep the majority of the market forever and a day, which would suit the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  I am right about that because I know how difficult it was to lower the bankruptcy period to one year.  I had black hair when I started and grey hair by the time the Bill was passed.<\/p><p> I will finish on my next point in deference to the Chairman who has done a great job in bringing this important issue forward.  I live in the heart of rural Ireland, as do many of my colleagues.  The lack of proper broadband and the way broadband was rolled out by various companies pose a significant challenge.  My parish was divided in two.  I know a woman with a very good business.  The broadband provision stopped next door to her business, at her brother's premises.  I could not persuade the company to provide her with broadband for her equestrian business which was expanding abroad.  It was a waste of time talking to the company.<\/p><p> On microenterprises, I remember going to a conference in Kiltimagh many years ago.  They were 15 years ahead of their time.  There were cottage industries and microenterprises.  People could work from home and make contacts across the world.  Some of those at the conference in Kiltimagh were selling to China.  That is what one wants.  That has nothing to do with the credit unions, Irish Rural Link, Mr. Boland, Mr. Kinahan and Ms Kinahan who advocate constantly for microenterprise.  They have done a good job but I regret that they are wasting sweetness in the desert air because things are so difficult for microenterprises.<\/p><p> I come from and live in rural Ireland.  Many of the closures in rural Ireland result from rural people passing their local shops and businesses to travel to Aldi, Lidl or Dunnes Stores or another multiple in the nearest big town.  They are happy to go to the local shop at 9 p.m. when one would not get a litre of milk anywhere else.  Let us call a spade a spade.  I will not join any marches protesting post office closures or shop closures or anything else because to do so would be hypocritical.  The same applies to the credit unions.  One should shop locally as best one can.  During the recession, people had to stretch every euro and I understand that.  All my brothers are married with families and mortgages and so on.  If people have a few more shillings now, they should spend them locally.  That goes for every sector.  People should not whinge to Ciaran Mullooly on RT&Eacute; about local businesses closing if they are not prepared to spend their money there.  I shop for anything I can in my village.  I rarely buy diesel anywhere else.  If I went to Mullingar, I would probably get it cheaper.  So what?  I want my local petrol station to remain open.  There will not be a shop between Mullingar and Longford in five years' time.  I am sure it is the same in other areas.  I am not as familiar with County Clare or some other areas as I am my own but the Deputies beside me told the truth about their areas.  I am not a great believer in technology and I still write letters to constituents.  Forget about email.  As with the credit union, people want instant responses to emails.  They may send it at 10 o'clock and want a reply by 11 o'clock.  Any replies I said are sent in the post.  If we do not send letters, there will be no jobs for postal workers.<\/p><p> Personal contact is the essence of any banking relationship, but it is the antithesis of what is happening today in the pillar banks.  The pillar banks are predicated on impersonal banking, talking to machines and writing to post office boxes.  I tried to get a loan from a bank and ended up in Dublin talking to someone who did not know me.  I have been banking with Bank of Ireland since 1978 but it did not have a clue who I was.  Forty years of dealing with it and I could have pretended to be the Chairman, Deputy Carey.  I could have been anybody.  I was involved in a campaign for the restoration of lodgement and transaction facilities.  Shopkeepers who had never seen lodgment machines were forced to use them.  Many shopkeepers were unfamiliar with computerisation.  The banks were making little of them.  I note that Ms Francesca McDonagh has copped on and is investing in bank services that allow customers to talk to staff.<\/p><p> On regulation, red tape and bureaucracy, people have it in their power to keep shops open but the Government is helping to close them.  Why did it bring in a rates re-evaluation process at the tail end of a recession and increase rates by up to 100%?  Even the Tories in Britain brought in rates relief for shops of a certain size in the recent budget.  We should cop on and not pay lip service to rural Ireland but, rather, keep it alive as best we can.  It will not be like it was when I was growing up in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, but we should retain as much of it as we can.  We should adapt our planning framework to ensure rural Ireland is sustained.  I thank the witnesses for their enlightening presentation.  I urge them to work together on the public banking model and not to be afraid, apprehensive or defensive.  We will get there if we keep going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#M00400","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Penrose for his very thorough contribution.

I agree with much of what was said by Deputy Penrose.  On shopping local, people may try to save a few cent by going to supermarkets but if they need something at night or at 7 a.m. in the morning they can phone their local shop to arrange to collect it.<\/p> <p>  My mother has known Mr. Boland for many years.  He is joined by Ms Lennon.  Last Sunday morning, three publicans from my constituency contacted me to say that if things do not change, they will close up.  People might wonder what difference that will make.  It would affect three more families and businesses.<\/p><p>As Deputy Penrose said, the rates are crippling them.  If there are no people coming in the door, there is no point in getting it going.  They are having a torrid time at the moment.  There are many great communities around the country.  I believe the Government should offer a minibus to the community council or parish council in every area on the basis of an interest-free loan with no vehicle registration tax and no VAT.  We should do this not because the people involved are looking for handouts but as a means of providing a level playing pitch.  We could go out the gates of Leinster House this minute and jump on bus or Luas or into a taxi, but people in rural areas do not have such facilities.  If we look at the possibility of losing in the bigger scheme of things, we will see that it involves businesses closing.  My proposal would cost a small amount of money in that context.<\/p><p> When we talk about carbon, we have to address issues like fuel poverty that have been mentioned by Mr. Boland.  It has been suggested that there should be a citizens' assembly for the Lord Mayor of Dublin, but I believe that groups like Age Action Ireland, people like the witnesses who are present today and members of the farming and business communities should be represented at a rural assembly which would consider the issues that are affecting rural Ireland.  Farmers are getting hammered day in, day out.  They are nearly being told that they are polluters of the world.  According to the figures that have been cited by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, farmers account for a minuscule percentage of emissions.  The farmers of this country, who are renowned for producing top-quality food, are nearly afraid to say they are farmers because they are being told they are destroying the world.  People in this place need to stop kicking everyone who is producing anything.  It seems to be a great train for people in the D&aacute;il to jump on.  People in the city and in the country, by our very nature, are going to affect something when we get up in the morning, even when we go to the toilet.  We need to be clear on that.<\/p><p> I have met representatives of the credit unions and people like Mr. Boland in many different committees.  I wonder whether committees will solve anything.  As Deputy Penrose pointed out earlier, there is no point in not pulling with the public banking model.  The other banks have absconded from rural Ireland and that is it.  If we look at the history of credit unions, and I can be corrected if I am wrong, we will see that in the big, bad world of many years ago, when things were going bad, something like &euro;250 million would have had to be put aside.  We were told that it would be a bad day.  The Irish people are still paying for &euro;65 million that was parked in the main banking sector and used.  If I am right, just &euro;25 million was used in the credit union sector.  It might not even have been that much.  I stand to be corrected in that regard.  This shows that the credit unions were doing things fairly right.  As Deputy Penrose has pointed out, at one stage some of the RT&Eacute; correspondents were mad to show that nearly everyone should withdraw their money from the credit unions because certain things were going to happen.  The proof is in the pudding in terms of what has gone on.<\/p><p> I would like to set out the reality for someone who is in business.  I do an awful lot of dealing with the local credit union.  At the moment, a person might be buying a house, a piece or land or a bit of machinery.  I remind the committee that one can get leasing.  As Deputy Penrose has pointed out, some credit unions have things at 5%, 8% or 9%.  That is too dear, to be honest.  If the credit unions are to compete with the banking model, it needs to be between 3% and 4%, in my opinion.  I am being quite blunt about it.  A person will get small loans, but he or she will not get the bigger loans unless that person whips himself or herself into line.  I suggest that this can be attributed to the regulations that have been imposed on the credit unions.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding that all of this is down to the way the credit unions are being screwed.  I believe that credit union money was keeping the main pillar banks going.  The credit unions were not allowed to spend it.  They had &euro;17 billion or &euro;18 billion, but they had to put a quarter of it into A1-rated banks.  We had no A1-rated banks, even though we pretended we had.  The credit unions do not have a clearance system that the Minister can sign, along the lines of the system used for clearing money or cheques with the main banks.  I know the credit unions were blocked from that a few years ago.  A Minister can change that.  That is one thing.  The second thing is that a cards system is needed.  I will explain the third thing.  No one is saying &euro;50,000 is no good.  If I am in business and I am given &euro;100,000 by a credit union to buy a field, the ratios that apply to credit unions mean that the credit union in question will need a certain number of other people to take out loans of &euro;5,000, &euro;6,000 or &euro;10,000.  That will not work.  I would love people to do all their business with credit unions.<\/p><p> I will mention another thing on which credit unions need to concentrate in the context of rural Ireland.  Deputy Eugene Murphy is well aware of a problem that exists at the moment.  I would say he would agree with me in this regard.  In some parts of this country, people with big single farm payments are coming from other parts of the country to buy up tracts of land.  They can do this because the pillar banks are giving them the money to do so on the basis of their turnover.  There are two parts to this matter.  If we are going to keep rural Ireland, and if the credit unions want to stay in business, there will need to be people in rural Ireland.  If small farmers with small single farm payments are being blown out because they cannot buy certain tracts of land, I believe a type of financial system that is backed up by the Government is needed.  Deputy Penrose will recall the era of the Land Commission.  I am not saying we have to bring that back in the same way.  If there are 30 acres for sale and three small farmers want to buy ten acres each, they need to be heard when they go into the credit union.  If someone with a single farm payment worth &euro;100,000 goes into one of the pillar banks, and so does Johnny the farmer who has a single farm payment worth &euro;5,000, it is easy to know who will get the money.  The credit unions need to get more involved in this kind of lending.  I appreciate that they have come on in leaps and bounds.<\/p><p> I would like to propose something here.  I have seen the witnesses who are present today going from committee to committee.  They are punching as hard as they can.  I accept that there are things they can change.  The Government has said that we do not need a new public bank.  We need to get to the nail of this and see why not.  I would like this committee to bring in the likes of the Central Bank.  I do not know whether we can do this.  Deputy Penrose and the Chair will tell me whether we can.  Someone from the Central Bank should be brought in here to tell us why people in rural Ireland are being screwed because of regulations that have been imposed on the credit unions.  I think that needs to be done.  We need to bring in the likes of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to get it involved in all of this.  The Department should be involved too.  In fairness to guys like the representatives of Irish Rural Link, the community banking sector and the credit unions, for the past year they have been going around making proposals and submissions to every committee and to everyone here and there, but nothing has been happening.  It is a question of \"same story, different day\".  People soon get tired of knocking on the wall when nothing is happening.  Sooner or later, the witnesses will say \"to hell with them, they are not even worth going up to\".  They will be right to do so, in light of the way things have gone.<\/p><p> I believe the credit unions, along with the public banking sector, have to be the new banks in every part of the rural economy.  In fairness to the credit unions, they open and provide their facilities in small villages on Sunday mornings or Saturday evenings.  I advise the credit unions not to fly away from those locations if they get more services.  To be honest, the credit unions need to offer what others are offering.  I am saying this as someone who is in business.  If I want to buy a tractor in the morning, I am looking at &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  Deputy Penrose has described them as monstrous machines, but unfortunately they have to be big to get through the work.  A leasing company will do it over seven years.  This facility is not made available to credit unions.  The interest rates are different.  If I want to buy a bit of land, I need the money over ten or 15 years.<\/p><p>No one can do it in five years.  Even if the rate is 5%, we need a facility.  A rate of 9% will not work.  One will lose the business over that.  If everyone here went into a credit union, one or two of us might be lucky enough to get a loan if we were at the beginning.  Regulations on the credit unions mean they cannot do it.  That has to be changed.  I understand that it is for the Central Bank to change.  It is like pulling teeth from the Central Bank to get anything done.<\/p><p> I have a question for Mr. Charles Murphy.  I have a vision for credit unions.  They started off locally everywhere and were set up by great people.  That local aspect needs to be kept.  We need to be able to keep that and still call it Joe Bloggs' credit union, but to move to where we need to, we need to have them more together so there is a bigger pot of money and a person can borrow more.  How do we achieve that in the credit union movement, to get that message across to people, still calling it the local credit union while getting a bigger pot, whether for Roscommon, Galway or Dublin?  I noted from what Mr. Ed Farrell said that the witnesses are being careful they do not move like the banks, as Deputy Penrose said.  In the past, a person went into a bank and talked to a bank manager who brought him or her into a room, and that person either got a loan or did not.  That person now has to do most of it by email and ring someone.  If he or she then talks to the local bank manager, that manager will say they will fill something out and send it to Dublin.  Someone will then ring from Dublin who does not have an iota about how a person was through his or her life and who does not give a damn about that person, because the person is only a digit.<\/p><p> Mr. Farrell talked about credit unions and bigger loans.  As many decisions as possible need to be made locally.  He said they could go down nearly the same road as the bank.  I sound a note of caution on that.  There are criteria that anyone has to meet.  We should not go that distance and end up like the banks.  I propose to the committee that someone from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, the Department or the Central Bank should attend.  I do not care which.  We will go nowhere if we do not get different groups into a room here.  We will not say we will solve it here.  The Minister for Finance has a lot to do with this too.  We need to chisel it out to see if we are on a run or not.  If we are not, we do not need to be wasting these people's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#N00300","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":886,"content":"<p>If members are in agreement, we will ask representatives of the Central Bank, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the Department of Finance to attend the committee-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#P00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I do not know what the SBCI does.

Some 60% of County Roscommon needs the national broadband plan roll-out, more than any other county in Ireland, as Deputy Fitzmaurice will know from serving the constituency, as do many parts of east Galway, where he lives.  It is important and the witnesses may say that they are telling us that, that we are the legislators and we should do it.  I get frustrated with the talk.  It goes on year after year about where the problems are and what we need to do, and then little or nothing happens.  Broadband is very important.  I know where the witnesses are coming from and I like to write letters myself.  Business, schools and others will say how important broadband is.  People have moved out of Roscommon to Longford because we did not have sufficient broadband for businesses in my area.<\/p> <p>  Things that should not be happening irrespective of not having a national broadband plan roll-out still happen.  In north-east Roscommon, Tarmonbarry is on the N5, the national primary route.  I am sure many people know it.  Mr. Farrell knows it anyway.  Rooskey village is in the news at the moment for a different reason.  The company that was rolling out broadband for Eir, KN, rolled the broadband down the 043 line from Tarmonbarry towards Rooskey.  It is eight miles between Tarmonbarry and Rooskey.  Four miles along, it cuts off where the 043 line finishes.  Another group came up on the 071 line and finishes where it stops.  It leaves 200 m and six houses without a connection.  That should be solved overnight.  Despite talking to Eir and others, it could not be done.  Within that area where there were six houses, two people ran businesses from home.  They have stopped that now.  They had to move.  No matter what hold-up is in the system, there should be a situation where that type of minor issue can be dealt with.  That is where we are failing.  That is really frustrating people.<\/p> <p>  I accept that broadband companies are there to make money but they pick and choose.  There was a situation in north Roscommon, which I think Deputy Fitzmaurice will be aware of, where a certain company was providing broadband.  It is not an easy area to provide broadband to.  The company found a more lucrative area to come from and so pulled out and left up to 100 people without broadband and moved to the more lucrative area where it could get more customers and there was a better connection.  It is important that we get to the point where the Government delivers this and we as politicians have to work hard on that.  The rates issue has been addressed.  I agree with Deputy Penrose that it would be timely to have a review.  Some premises and small businesses came out on the plus side but a considerable number of businesses had a massive increase in rates in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will be straight about the banking situation.  I am a believer in credit unions and will nail my colours to the mast.  I believe credit unions should be allowed to broaden their remit into the area of banks and Government and others should acknowledge that.  We have a problem with a number of banks pulling out of small towns.  Credit unions have been very supportive of communities.  I do not think it is possible to argue for a new banking model one day and for credit unions the next.  A person can support one or the other.  I support the credit unions because of their record, the network and the branches.  They are in most towns, including those which do not have banks.  Let us move on with it and let the credit unions take on board what we have said here today, particularly what Deputies Penrose and Fitzmaurice have been saying.<\/p> <p>  Going back to Mr. Boland's point, I have been saying for years that when we had the Industrial Credit Company, ICC, and Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, they were significant.  When they were both removed from the system, it was a major drawback for financing.  It narrowed the field.  It is one of the reasons many banking problems have arisen.  Credit unions may need to get out to the farming community more.<\/p><p>They should let them know what is available and how they can help them.  Quite a number of people in the farming community are not fully aware of their products and what they can do now in regard to loans.<\/p><p> On balanced regional development, the programme for Government says we are going to create 500,000 jobs throughout Ireland over the next four to five years.  We were promised that 275,000 of those would be in rural Ireland.  It is not happening in our area.  The jobs are just not being created.  I acknowledge it is happening in other parts of the country.  In places like Roscommon or east Galway, it is just not happening.  That is the problem.  One does not have the work.  Up to 1,000 people a day leave County Roscommon to travel to Dublin to work in the private and public sectors.  Members of my family get up at 4.30 a.m. and get back at 9 p.m.  Put oneself in the place of a young parent, particularly a young mother, who leaves a house at that time of the day and does not get home until 9 p.m.  It is a shocking life for anybody.  It is not acceptable.  We have to rectify it because we have all of this development, which we hear about over and over again.  The west and the midlands are so open to development that it makes sense to put the money into those regions and to draw more people back into them.<\/p><p> I refer another matter of concern in rural areas.  Deputy Fitzmaurice touched on financing, the purchase of land, etc.  There is another problem there.  The growth of forestry - we need certain forestry and I am not saying we do not need it - is utterly appalling in this country.  Somebody needs to stop what is happening.  Recently I got figures that show 23% of all the licences for forestry granted by the Department between 2016 and spring 2018 went to three counties.  That is over a quarter of all the licences.  They went to Leitrim, Roscommon and Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#P00600","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":892,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#Q00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":893,"content":"<p>The problem here is if one goes into a bank tomorrow morning to buy a bit of land, it will ask quite openly if it is for forestry, dairy farming or beef farming.  If one says forestry, straight away one will get better terms.  One does not have to put up as much money to get that loan which, again, is outrageous.  Something needs to be done on the basis of fair play.  What has happened with a number of young progressive farmers in my area who want to be in agriculture and who want to get decent holdings is that they are placed in a situation where a forestry company does a deal with a farmer and the land is gone.  They do not even get a chance to bid for that land.  It could be 20 to 30 acres of pretty decent land and it is a shame that is happening.  I am not going to hold people up any longer.  The witnesses have had a long morning and the Chairman has been very fair to us all.  We will have an opportunity to put other points again.<\/p> <p>  The reduction in the number of small businesses is a huge concern.  Deputy Penrose is correct to a degree.  We need to admit that many people are leaving their areas and are going to the bigger stores in regional towns.  That is fine as  people have a choice.  For generations, we have had policy in our house that one spends as much of one's money as one possibly can close to home.  I am not ashamed to say that my late father said, and my mother still says, that when we were young they did not always have the money to feed us, and the local shops in the local towns gave us food or whatever.  We should never forget those type of stories.  I will never be ashamed to tell that story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#Q00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":894,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#Q00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Eugene Murphy.

I thank all of them for their comments.  The bank we are proposing is not in opposition to the credit union.  Let us be clear about that.  It is not an either-or; it is a complementation.  We are talking about a public bank, a not for profit one and an Irish model.  In this type of bank, which has been in operation for more than 200 years in Germany, vulture funds would not get in.  We have farmers in this country whose land is owned by the vulture funds.  I have no problem if the credit unions step up to the mark.  I am a member of a credit union and I owe it a lot but Irish Rural Link's job is to challenge.  That is what we are here for.  We will not be bankers at the end of this process.  We want to see a situation where the local business can borrow &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or even &euro;500,000 without the fear that it will end up with a vulture funds or with the shareholders of the London Stock Exchange calling it in.  That is what we want and I do not really care how we manage that.<\/p> <p>  I remember Charlie McCreevy gave out to us, saying we were great at throwing stones in through the bars and whingeing but that we never offered solutions.  Here is a solution.  People are free to knock it but if they do so, then they should come up with a better solution.  Do not tell me the current situation is brilliant because it is not.  There are thousands of people in their 30s and 40s living from day to day because they cannot meet mortgage repayments, mortgages they took out in the good years.  Angela Merkel has made major comments on the quality of a public bank and has come around to the view that were it not for the public bank in Germany, it would now be in real trouble.  Do not knock Irish Rural Link for doing this.  We are here to challenge.  We have put forward a proposal but if it is knocked, pick a better one.<\/p> <p>  On the question of rates-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":897,"content":"<p>Mr. Boland's phone has not let him down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#Q00700","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":898,"content":"<p>He is a wanted man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#Q00800","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":899,"content":"<p>We will have to conclude here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#Q00900","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542191400,"counter":900,"content":"<p>We have a big problem on rates and in rural Ireland.

I wish to make reference to what Deputy Eugene Murphy said about the commuter belt and people travelling to work.  I represent the Irish League of Credit Unions but I am also a volunteer member of the board of an urban credit union in a community that shares the same problems as those facing rural communities.  Reference was made to some of the problems facing communities.  Approximately 70% of our population are travelling to work in Dublin every day to the detriment of our community.  The credit union where I live supports the local forum and local industry.  We give grants to them and we give loans wherever possible when people apply for them.<\/p> <p>  One problem is that we are a small credit union and regulation dictates that we cannot give loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, including farmers, over 25% of our regulatory reserve.  That, in effect, stifles us in that area.  Mr. Ed Farrell said that the Irish League of Credit Unions proposal is essentially that credit unions would participate in a State-backed vehicle that would enable individual credit unions to act as an efficient distribution network to originate SME loan applications.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the issue of rates as well.  I can only talk about my own independent entity as a credit union.  We have an incremental rate span.  The rate we charge depends on the subject or what the loan is for.  On other occasions we take into consideration the socioeconomic position of the person who is applying for the loan.  As an urban credit union with so much in common with the rural situation, we are of the people and we give where we possibly can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018111400002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charles Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1542191400,"counter":909,"content":"<p>You have been conscious of the time, Mr. Murphy.

It is always a privilege to come back and speak on behalf of the Heritage Council.  Dr. Marie Bourke, who is a Heritage Council member since 2016,  is a member of the council's strategy group which developed the strategy document that we will be discussing with members, joins me as does Dr. Helene O'Keefe, the Heritage Council's head of education and communication.<\/p> <p>  The timing of the presentation on the council&rsquo;s new strategy is very appropriate.  It comes almost exactly 12 months after the chairman of the Heritage Council, Michael Parsons, appeared before this committee prior to his confirmation as chairman.  On that occasion the chairman outlined his vision for the future of the organisation and this strategy is now the logical progression of that.  His vision was seen through his own community-based experiences, particularly his commitment to education at a national level as an active member of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD.<\/p> <p>  It is also very pertinent at this point to be very clear with members that the choice of moniker or name of our new strategy: Heritage at the Heart, is very significant.  The chairman of the council in his opening remarks to the strategy emphasises the Heritage Council&rsquo;s strategic vision is to see heritage at the heart of Irish society and I will come to the definition of heritage so that the committee will understand where the council is coming from in that.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the committee is aware that in working to secure its vision the chairman of the council also acknowledges the role of the many partners with which the council works, partners particularly but not exclusively within the heritage community.<\/p><p>As the committee is aware, the council is but one small agency within that community; therefore, such a partnership approach is not only desirable but also essential if it is to carry out its responsibilities under the Heritage Act 1995, as amended in the Heritage Act 2018.<\/p><p> In the context of partnership, I am absolutely delighted that the committee will also hear today from the chairperson of the Local Authority Heritage Officer Network.  Local authorities have always been identified as key partners of the council as a small agency reaching out to communities.  The partnership between the Heritage Council and the local authorities that has led to 28 local authorities employing heritage officers can be considered to be a jewel in the crown of everything the council has achieved in the 20 short years since it was established.  Other initiatives such as Museum Standards Programme Ireland and the National Biodiversity Data Centre are built on policy proposals developed by the council.  It has to be said - I hope members fully appreciate this - that they have become essential parts of national heritage infrastructure.  This serves the people of Ireland and assures quality and excellence in Oireachtas decision-making, our policy proposals and the use of that information as an educational tool.<\/p><p> As legislators, I do not have to remind committee members that all of our work derives from the Heritage Act 1995 which established the Heritage Council as a body corporate.  The council has 11 members who are represented today by Dr. Marie Bourke.  A key function of the council under the Act is proposing policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national heritage.  Members of the committee are asked to note that the Heritage Council, therefore, enjoys responsibilities for both natural and cultural heritage.  All of its work seeks to integrate the relationships between people and place and between nature and culture.   As amended by the 2018 Act which I note took a long time to deliver, the council has a particular responsibility which I wish to emphasise to the committee.  It is to co-operate with, engage with, advise and support public authorities, local communities and persons on the functions of the council.<\/p><p> I ask members to note the reference to local communities.  The reference to local communities was one of the key and substantive amendments made to the Heritage Act 1995 in 2018.  No such specific reference to our work with communities was included in the 1995 Act and the change reflects the fact that carrying out our tasks would not be possible without the support of the communities Oireachtas Members are elected to serve.  <\/p><p> Members of the committee are also asked to note the council's function of co-ordinating all activities related to its functions.  This has allowed the council to collaborate and influence key land use interests such as agriculture and forestry, on which I can expand, as appropriate.  More particularly in recent years, it has included educational and other interests such as community and rural development. <\/p><p> From a legislative point of view, the Heritage Council also has specific responsibilities under the Planning and Development Acts, the Heritage Fund Act 2001 as a member of the Council of National Cultural Institutions and section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of the donation of heritage objects to the State.  In meeting our statutory obligations and translating them into effective actions through implementation of our strategic plan I pay particular attention to why heritage matters, not to the Heritage Council or necessarily Members of the Oireachtas but to people, that is, to all of us.  Heritage is the foundation of our culture and has been described as the steady pulse of contemporary Ireland.  I emphasise the word \"contemporary\".  It does not just encompass buildings, monuments and museum pieces.  As highlighted in the Act, it includes our distinctive landscapes and native wildlife.  About 12 months ago we made a presentation on natural heritage.  Heritage takes in woodlands, literature, folklore and crafts, all of which have been passed on to us from previous generations.  It defines who we are in the present and our efforts to understand our heritage, protect it and interpret it will be our legacy to future generations and - I dare to be so presumptive as to say - the legacy of Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> Whether tangible or intangible, personal or collective, heritage is at the heart of Irish society.  Its relevance is palpable at local level.  We can expand on this point in answer to questions from members.  Heritage drives economies.  I refer to the tourism and agriculture sectors, sectors the quality of which is determined by the quality of our heritage.  It stimulates innovation.  An example is the art at the entrance to the committee rooms.  Heritage inspires artists in their interpretation of landscapes.  Our craft workers and designers at a local level all seek inspiration from the places in which they live.  Heritage also acts as a focal point for festivals and commemorations.  This is something about which we can talk in much more detail with reference to Heritage Week and, in regard to culture, European Year of Cultural Heritage, as members choose.  Heritage is, undoubtedly, a touchstone of identity.  It fosters a sense of belonging and supports social cohesion at local and national level.  Simultaneously, it crosses borders and transcends differences, connecting people through shared values, history and traditions.  Our plan identifies three specific objectives: to advance national heritage priorities, to nurture belonging and to ensure a vibrant heritage sector.  <\/p><p> I refer, first, to our aim to advance national heritage priorities.  It is important to note that international policymakers, particularly within the European Union, are becoming increasingly aware of the potential of heritage to contribute to economic growth and social cohesion, as well as to national pride and well-being.  All of our actions in the implementation of the plan will emphasise this. <\/p><p> On nurturing belonging, I note that in a world of increasing globalisation, multiculturalism and mobility we tend to lose sight of what is local.  Heritage inspires a sense of belonging to both geographic and thematic communities.  Heritage lies at the root of our individual and collective identities.  Importantly, it is also the seed from which new connections can grow.  The Heritage Council sees its strategy as a blueprint for increasing inclusivity.  It addresses the inextricable links between heritage, identity, people and place and the absolute imperative to engage with both the diaspora and community-based custodians of heritage. <\/p><p> Our third objective is to ensure a vibrant heritage sector.  The Heritage Council has always taken an innovative approach to enabling communities to care for and enjoy their local heritage.  This has been pursued through its grant schemes which have been much curtailed as funding has decreased.  It is evident in dynamic heritage networks such as the heritage officer network, the Irish Walled Towns Network and the Museum Standards Programme Ireland network, as well as new networks such as the Irish uplands partnerships.  We look to provide impetus and small levels of support for community engagement and the development of heritage awareness and participation.  The plan includes a strong commitment to educational and research programmes to stimulate curiosity and promote the highest levels of understanding and appreciation of our national heritage.<\/p><p> The plan does not touch on the fourth and probably most significant element.  One could say it is a strategic decision; I will leave it to members to decide.  The fourth element requires emphasis.  In this changing world of compliance and governance, we need to ensure the Heritage Council is effective in its administration and financial management and has the governance capacity to allow it to operate effectively and develop the Irish heritage.  The chairman of the council addresses this imperative in the plan by stating the Heritage Council is aware of the constraints of its current capacity and will continue to be imaginative and innovative in the way it both secures and directs its resources.  <\/p><p> It is pleasing to note the prominence accorded to heritage in many Government and political manifestoes and recent Government policies and initiatives such as Culture 2025, Creative Ireland, the national landscape strategy, the biodiversity plan, the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040 and the Action Plan for Rural Development.<\/p><p>The commitment given by the Minister, Deputy Madigan, to publish a new national heritage plan in the next 12 months will add further impetus to our work.<\/p><p> Critical to achieving the Heritage Council&rsquo;s vision for the period 2018 to 2022 is the continued support and development of the dynamic and diverse heritage sector.  Heritage can play a key role in helping to resolve complex and changing socioeconomic issues such as the housing crisis and motivating the heritage-led regeneration of the centres of some of Ireland&rsquo;s cities, towns and villages and the plan seeks to address these contemporary issues.  Working with others to facilitate the reuse of existing buildings can help to alleviate aspects of the crisis.  Great strides have been made by such things as the rural development plan and village programmes, although more needs to be done.<\/p><p> In a similar way, new initiatives that focus on native woodlands, acknowledging the value of high nature farming and the development of a series of uplands partnerships, can help in alleviating the contemporary issues surrounding climate change and rural decline.  To be effective, the Heritage Council needs to enhance its capacity, both its overall staff numbers and the capital and revenue funding required to serve the public.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with a view to securing the enhanced capacity in an incremental manner over the lifetime of the plan.<\/p><p> The Heritage Council very much welcomes the recent launch by the Minister of the public consultation process for Heritage Ireland 2030.  The Heritage Council has always received cross-party support and setting a vision for 2030 will transcend Governments.  This is a commitment to a revitalised and refreshed national heritage plan which I know local authority heritage officers and chief executives welcome as a framework within which they can allocate funding.<\/p><p> In her foreword the Minister states Heritage 2030 will bring together a tapestry of other relevant heritage initiatives, providing an overarching space for engagement and action in the next decade.  I particularly like the word \"action\" in that context.  It will integrate essential national heritage policy principles into the future strategy of the entire Government and be supported by investment under Project Ireland 2040, setting out a real vision which we can all work to fulfil.  The Heritage Council looks forward to contributing fully and constructively to this process.  In the consultation exercise we will ensure commitments are given and that the most effective frameworks are put in place, as well as fully resourced, to allow all objectives to be met within the lifetime of the plan.  I encourage all members to engage with their local community in the consultation process.  The challenges are immense, but the opportunity presented needs to be grasped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Starrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for inviting the Local Authority Heritage Officer Network to make this presentation.  I am heritage officer with Monaghan County Council and chairperson of the Local Authority Heritage Officer Network.  I am joined by my heritage officer colleague from Donegal County Council, Dr. Joseph Gallagher.<\/p> <p>  Heritage is part and parcel of our identity.  It is the thatched cottages in County Donegal and the special way the thatch is held down with ropes to stop it from lifting on a windy day.  It is the Irish damselfly which is distinctively apple green on its thorax and only found on a small number of lakes and wetlands on this island.  It is our legacy of townland names such as An Currach or B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Chatha which are so rich in language and meaning, hiding within them old histories and land use.  It is the dawn chorus; one will not hear the same birds in any other country.  It is our cultural landscape which is dotted with monuments from past societies such as D&uacute;n Aengus or Loughcrew and large earthworks such as the Black Pig's Dyke.  There are historical buildings such as Muckross House and Dublin's Henrietta Street, as well as courthouses and market houses dotted throughout towns.  In their very construction, design and ornamentation they highlight the work of skilled craftspeople and play a vital role in towns and villages.  It is our farming traditions, including the Burren winterage and upland farming practices which are in synch with their habitats and create high nature value.  It is our music, language, instruments, songs, sports, stories and folklore which are so evocative of place and time.  <\/p> <p>  The recent inscription of the uileann pipes on the international list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity underlines the uniqueness of Ireland&rsquo;s culture and heritage as an enriching element of all humanity.  All tangible and intangible elements weave together to form our heritage and connect people with it.  Heritage is a public good which belongs to us all and is crucial for identity, as a cultural anchor and for social stability, especially in times of change.  It is for well-being as it contributes to the maintenance of a healthy environment, cultural jobs, cultural tourism jobs, creativity and farming.  The best people to conserve and protect our heritage are local communities which have been doing a stellar job with limited resources.  Enabling and facilitating them to achieve this is the main role of the heritage officer programme which has been in existence for almost 20 years.  The recently published European Cultural Heritage Strategy Century recognises that there is an urgent need to reposition cultural heritage policies to place them at the heart of an integrated approach which focuses on the conservation, protection and promotion of heritage by society as a whole - by both the national authorities and communities.<\/p> <p>  Established in 1999, the local authority heritage officer programme is one of the Heritage Council co-operative initiatives and allows the council to effectively reach local government and communities all over the country.  Both parties contribute to the success of the programme.  The Heritage Council funds the heritage officer programme at a rate of 25%.  Out of the 31 local authorities, there are 25 heritage officers in place, with a number in the process of being recruited.  The heritage officer role is a strategic one and must be a core service within a changing local government system which has oriented increasingly towards the community.  The Heritage Council provides technical support for the heritage officer programme which is important, as heritage officers are, by and large, stand-alone heritage professionals in their organisations.  Like arts officers, they are under a different Department from the local authority.  We share similar goals and align local heritage plans with the Heritage Council's strategic plan.  We bring innovative participatory practices into the heritage sphere, involving communities to de-bureaucratise heritage and, once again, engage people with it.  We are living and working in communities.  We help to create conditions where experts can meet communities to share with each other tangible and intangible knowledge of heritage.  Advocacy, capacity building and such underpinning are essential to support the Government in achieving its departmental goals, including the national heritage plan and the national biodiversity plan, as well as implementation of other heritage protections and policies.<\/p> <p>  It can be challenging to deliver a heritage agenda when the importance of the heritage mandate is overlooked, as it sometimes can be.  It can manifest itself in poor planning decisions and a failure to recognise and capitalise on heritage related economic activities and potential.  Project Ireland 2040 recognises the importance of heritage and historical town cores and aims to bring historical buildings back into use.  This has been supported by the new historical towns initiative such as one in Portlaoise and the town centre health checks throughout the country, including in Monaghan, organised by the Heritage Council and supported by the heritage officers.<\/p> <p>  Successful local heritage management requires a wide definition of heritage, capacity for heritage management, a planned strategic approach, commitment and support, leadership and heritage data.  The development and implementation of local heritage plans, with heritage forums, contribute to this process.  We link with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht through its services, particularly the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Monuments Service and the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage.<\/p><p>These relationships are crucial.  We provide data through local survey work to those bodies, as well as to the National Biodiversity Data Centre.  We also work with Creative Ireland through the local culture teams to embed culture and creativity at the heart of public policy.  We welcome the recent announcement of the consultation for the new national heritage plan, Heritage Ireland 2030.  The absence of recent Government policy in this area had created an unhelpful policy vacuum and gap in heritage leadership, which we hope can now be remedied. We have 20 years' experience building community and local involvement in heritage and are keen to share and work in partnership with the Department on the type of actions which could contribute to its objectives. <\/p><p> The heritage sector has grown through the heritage officer networks and includes communities and individuals throughout the country who are full of enthusiasm, knowledge and commitment.  They represent a huge resource if supported to be involved and to contribute their ideas and vision for heritage.  We are ready to assist the Department in this process to develop the new national heritage plan and to encourage communities to engage with the consultation process. <\/p><p> The Council of Europe has found that budgetary and human resources, both at the European level and at the level of some member states, are increasingly inadequate to ensure the conservation and the restoration of European heritage, and thus to ensure that it can be transmitted as a legacy to future generations.  Despite the increase in the remit, reach and demand for heritage services from the public since the establishment of the heritage officer programme in 1999, heritage officers for the most part still operate as one-person heritage sections.  The number of heritage officers has not materially changed since 2008.  We believe there is potential to expand the local heritage services to meet current demands and future ambitions.  We recently suggested to the Heritage Council board that an assistant heritage officer programme be established using a similar model as the original heritage officer programme.  Heritage practice is more complex than ever before for heritage managers but a strategic framework of the attributes of a good local heritage service has not been developed in Ireland.  An Australasian framework provides a potential model that may prove useful as the basis for such an examination, including a review of the existing barriers to such a service.  Funding for heritage plan implementation is important for local authorities and there is a need for continued and increased investment in this area especially as the new national heritage plan will seek activity and implementation at a local level. <\/p><p> In tandem with this funding, there is a need to increase community heritage grants through the Heritage Council to allow local communities as heritage custodians to engage and invest in their heritage in order that they can continue to create better places for people to live.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting the heritage officers to present our work to them.  I wish to extend an invitation to the committee on behalf of our network to visit heritage initiatives that have been supported by the heritage officer programme to see first-hand the contribution heritage is making to our communities and society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Clerkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":924,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith ag an aoi as an gcuireadh a tugadh ag an deireadh d&uacute;inn f&eacute;achaint m&oacute;rthimpeall na t&iacute;re ar ghn&eacute;ithe difri&uacute;la den obair at&aacute; rompu.

In the political sense there is often a lazy analysis that culture and heritage are the same thing but they are very different.  Heritage is what came before us and culture is what exists now.  The first presentation was interesting on how we can connect heritage with contemporaneous issues and Mr. Starrett mentioned housing.  How do we fight for heritage as a political priority?  Whenever we go abroad and put the face of Ireland to the world, heritage icons and arts and culture are to the fore but when we take budgetary measures at home they are way down at the bottom of the list.<\/p> <p>  I was very taken by Ms Clerkin's comment about the heritage officer being a one-person heritage section in each local authority.  That was a strong comment.  I know the witnesses might be constrained about how they answer my question but I would be interested to hear their response.<\/p> <p>  I taught for a long time in the inner city in Dublin.  The heritage there is very different to that in the text books the children are handed.  Their heritage is housing schemes, flat complexes, the docks, tuberculosis.  It is a different way of life.  When I was in school I could have recited every Land Act from 1870 but I was not necessarily as well versed in the housing schemes that came out of World War One or with what happened in tenement Dublin.  How do we connect heritage with every type of community in Ireland?  Ireland is not homogenous, there are different elements to the Irish nation that have a heritage that people need to connect with fully to make it theirs.  That involves reaching out to disconnection, disenfranchisement and disadvantage, making Irelands of everybody, if one likes, that it belongs to them.  <\/p> <p>  I am tickled that Mr. Starrett mentioned housing.  When we try to rejuvenate a listed building &ndash; I am thinking of a flat complex in Ballybough - we cannot redevelop it because it is a listed building.  How do we strike the balance between something that is worth saving and treasuring without it being an aloof aspiration which is not solving the needs of the day?  How can the witnesses help us help them?  How do we make heritage real to every community, particularly those which are disenfranchised, disconnected and disadvantaged and to new communities?  How do we help heritage solve issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#E00300","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I will not answer all the questions.  I will choose the easy one.  I will answer the question about making people connect.  The Chairman got it right in many ways when he said heritage is part of what we are.  Whether someone is in Ballybough or Inishowen, that is the place where they live, that is their environment and surroundings.  That is their contemporary heritage.  We have many inner city initiatives, working with people through educational services, to improve the quality of those places.  Heritage is not always the answer but education and the connection with people is where we make that connection.  It is all very well to have a huge capital investment in big projects but what we really need to invest in is people who can go out, communicate, encourage and support.  Governments will have to wrestle with that issue.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Marie Bourke is a great fighter.  I should refer the question on how do we fight for heritage to her because she has been fighting for heritage in Ireland much longer than I have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Starrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":927,"content":"<p>It is a privilege to be here to speak to members.  Probably, if one were to fight for Irish heritage, one would be fighting for one's key national asset.  If Irish heritage is one's key national asset, what could be a greater thing to be fighting for than everything that we are and everything that this nation is in terms of its landscape, natural heritage, rivers, culture and monuments?  The main argument is that heritage is critical to the tourism industry.  I use the analogy quite often of the museums standards programme, which is one of the great unsung success stories of the heritage programme.  The Heritage Council have been up and running for ten years and it has single-handedly raised the standards of Irish museums around the country.  The people who visit this country in the autumn, winter and spring who stay in lovely hotels want to go somewhere and do something.  The majority of European visitors want to find out about our heritage.  They normally go to a heritage centre and, preferably, a local museum.  While they are in the museum they do not necessarily want to find out about connections with Europe, which is a nice counter-product.  They want to know about the local people and what makes them tick, what they do and how they live.  Local museums are critical because people go to them to connect with local people, to find out about Irish society and to understand us.  That is a very small strand of our heritage.  If one thinks of a programme that the Heritage Council has set up, with huge consultation, and that raises the standard of all of our museums slowly bit by bit, and in conjunction with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, then one has something that improves the quality of Irish life and that is part of Irish heritage.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the work of the local authority heritage officer network.  Across the country heritage officers promote heritage.  If one is fighting for heritage, then one is fighting for something that is intrinsic to who we are and what we are going to leave for the future and for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Marie Bourke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I will answer the question on just having one heritage officer in each area and explain how we can tackle contemporary issues in a contemporary society.  One of the main roles of a heritage officer is to democratise heritage.  We try to explain national legislation and policies, which committees like this one contribute to and develop at a national level.  We, as heritage officers, bring legislation and policies within reach of ordinary citizens and allow them to see that as relevant to where they are and where they live.  We base all of our heritage work in the local area.  Our work is very much based on what type of place someone lives in whether that is vernacular buildings, industrial heritage or industrial landscapes.  We try to focus on the community in which people are based and not a fantasy community they see in textbooks or history books.<\/p> <p>  The local authority heritage officer network was established in 1999, which was innovative thinking by the Heritage Council.  The aim was to reach the objectives of the Heritage Act that established the Heritage Council.  The objectives would have been very unachievable with just 14 staff members of the Heritage Council, which is the cap on council numbers in legislation.  The network allowed the Heritage Council to promote its heritage objectives in local authorities and heritage communities.  The programme has been rolled out around the country since the establishment of the network.  There is one heritage officer per local authority and the number of heritage officers has not expanded.  However, the demand for our services has increased exponentially over the past 20 years, particularly over the past ten years during the bust because communities have re-engaged with their place and sense of place.  There has been re-engagement with people and one another.  We have tried to use heritage as a new driver for economic activity.  We have tried to use local places and heritage assets as a way to move tourism into places that probably had not been reached by tourism before.  We sought to use authentic heritage assets such as tour guides from local communities or whatever.  The demand for such services is huge.  In order for such heritage work to be done in an authentic way, we have provided support to local communities in order that their heritage objects or places are not commodified without their co-operation.  We have worked with people in communities to identify what is important about their area, to help them to conserve it and then to build on that by promoting places through other tourism assets in order that the tourism asset can become part of tourism initiatives such as Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Ireland's Ancient East of whatever.<\/p> <p>  The network works with communities.  Sometimes we work with road sections on planning applications.  We also work with economic development within our local authority and we work at the museum services with cultural teams.  Finally, we work with all local communities and our heritage forum.  The demand for our service has been at pinchpoint for the past seven or eight years.  There is great opportunity to support and facilitate communities to further develop in this area, particularly when the new national heritage plan is out for consultation at present.  There is a great opportunity for us to punch above our weight in this area.  As Dr. Bourke has correctly pointed out, this country constantly sells its national Irish heritage and it is heterogenous, not homogenous.  Our heritage is very distinctive and is based in local areas and we could support it better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Clerkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Gallagher wish to comment on the Donegal aspect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#F00500","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>I shall not comment specifically on the Donegal aspect but I shall reiterate some of the points made by Ms Clerkin.  One of the constant challenges of heritage is raising awareness.  In terms of all of our roles, that is a constant challenge among communities as well.  We have successfully raised awareness.  As Ms Clerkin has indicated, there is now a demand for heritage services at a local level.  Very often it is about supporting local initiatives.  Communities want to engage with all of the different aspects of heritage be it natural, built or cultural heritage.  Locals know their heritage best and often, one only needs to give them a bit of direction, advice and support to support their initiatives rather than encouraging them to do anything.  They have the capacity to deliver on the heritage agenda but they need direction early on, which is important.

The subjects for the radio programmes have ranged from moths in County Cavan to the sounds of nature at the dark sky park in Ballycroy National Park in County Mayo, which is extraordinary.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses sound extremely positive.  However, there are fewer curlews and finches, our streams and rivers are not what they should be and we are way behind Europe in terms of all of these things.  One can speak about people, place, nature and culture but each area is enormous.  Do the witnesses think we need a Department dedicated to just heritage?  People say that they are part of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Let us say that we are all part of one mother ship, that we are all going to shop at Tesco and soon they will be sending us to school.  I am not sure about the mother ship business because the Heritage Council is so powerful and delves into so many different areas.  One of the ways that the Heritage Council could become even greater at what it does is to become more independent.  It fascinates me that the Heritage Council is stuck in the middle of the Department.  In one way, I can see the tentacles and obvious connections.  In another way, the Heritage Council does not have the same independence of thought.  It seems to be caught with that tentacle, conduit and roadmap.  Would the Heritage Council be better off fighting for its own heritage Department?  I would do so, as well as keeping all of the other moments of people, place, nature and culture, which comes into the arts, language, music, song and everything that we do.<\/p><p>I wonder about it the more I see about the mother ship and the more everybody is under this umbrella.  Those involved in heritage are so important and while they are not at the end of a table they are part of a general table.  When one thinks of the arts - music, drama, dance and visual art - they too demand a Department.  At one stage heritage was with the same Department as sport and at another time it was with tourism.  The word \"sell\" is used all the time.  I do not like the word \"sell\".  We are not selling.  We have to learn to be.  It is us, we do not want to sell it.<\/p><p> One of the main points in what was said by Mr. Starrett is that extra heritage officers are needed.

What is needed now, in the context of a new strategic plan from the Heritage Council, a new national policy on heritage, is that it is matched up and that the funds and resources are there to allow that independence to be carried out.  All civilised states look after the things the state owns, such as their cultural institutions.  The State invests significant amounts in that now.  It is beginning to answer that question.

That collaboration works very well for us.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Senator O'Donnell said about the extinction of key wildlife species, biodiversity and the ecosystem services that those species and habitats support.

We try to link with all of those different agencies and we work very closely with the Heritage Council.  I do not know so much about the Departments but it is very useful that the Heritage Council is an independent established body to promote this national agenda.<\/p> <p>  The loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services is a very key issue for us.  We work with biodiversity issues and heritage issues together.  A lot of our heritage plans are now combined heritage and biodiversity.  Heritage has a key role to play in sustainable societies, whether that is reusing heritage assets in historic buildings, which is retaining their resource value, or conserving wildlife habitats and helping communities to do that or promoting agri-environment schemes which are results based, and to try to help people have livelihoods in rural areas.  We are very much trying to work in that sphere but we definitely require more resources to help us to do that, in particular going forward.

We were so curious that we found ourselves being told to go into the corner for a while.  We were into everything.  We wanted to know what older people were saying.

While I support him in that, in other places there is a need for a radon barrier and it is not possible financially to retain the building, particularly where it is not feasible for a person to live in it without a such a barrier being put in place.  We now know that radon causes health problems, including cancer.  One place that springs to mind in this regard is Castleisland, where we have lost three people in one family in a short period as a result of the effects of radon.  Things like that need to be overcome.  I do not know if the walls can be left standing but people tell us it is often not possible to deal with it properly.  Perhaps people could be encouraged to build the same type of building again in a modern way.  However, it is by talking about these things that we see what can be done to overcome the problems, and they are problems.  Sometimes we cannot understand why a house is left standing with no one using it, when it might not look too bad and might look as if it could be reused, but there are physical problems that need to be dealt with.  We need to work together to overcome these issues.

From a directory of experts, schools will book an expert to visit them.  The expert will then visit the school and, usually, where possible, will bring the students outside to their local heritage site or to a local aspect of their own heritage so they can see what is around them and appreciate that intrinsic connection between their own place and their own heritage.<\/p> <p>  This facility has been incredibly successful in terms of accessibility and diversity up to this point in the year.  We offer a system whereby the Heritage Council will pay a percentage of the expert's costs for the day and the school pays the balance.  In addition, we offer a scheme for delivering equality of opportunities in schools, DEIS, whereby the Heritage Council will pay a greater percentage.  This facilitates access for those schools to these heritage experts perhaps more than would otherwise have been the case.  This year, 796 designated disadvantaged schools have availed of that Heritage Council service.  It is allowing students to become more aware of, more familiar with and more appreciative of their local heritage and very much articulates the work of the Heritage Council in the context of its statutory obligation to educate and inform people about their heritage.

I agree with the Senator.  The vile with the valiant is always part of our heritage.  People often do not want to remember the vile but it is very  important to retain aspects of that for our own stability.  If we start to erode the bits we are uncomfortable with, a false identity based on something else can be created.  For example, many workhouses in Ireland have been retained and used, while not losing their history.  For example, the children's dormitory in the Carrickmacross workhouse in Monaghan is still active in the top floor.  The entire community uses the ground floors of the building, including a cr&egrave;che.  We very much need to do that.  Those are issues we explore at a local level through talks we give and also through the various programmes we run in our particular counties - Donegal, Monaghan and Louth.  In counties close to Northern Ireland we would do a lot of work looking at those difficult issues.  We explore those issues through heritage and local heritage sites.  It is a democratising way to look at issues, rather than focusing on politics.<\/p> <p>  On Creative Ireland and whether we are sure that heritage is not being left behind, I would not say we are sure that heritage is not being left behind.  We are trying to do our best on the cultural teams to make sure that does not happen.  I believe the chief executive of the programme, Ms Banotti, is keen to try to make sure that heritage comes to the fore and that we can use art as a new way to explore heritage.  For example, there was a fantastic pollinator initiative in Laois and Offaly.  It was done as part of the all-island pollinator plan, which comes through the national biodiversity data centre.  We have an award through Tidy Towns to support that.<\/p> <p>  Creative Ireland supported a new composing element.  Ian Wilson, from Belfast, made an entire piece where he interviewed local communities on pollinators and what they were doing with bees and insects.  He created an entire saxophonist piece for it that was then performed in Emo Court.  It was amazing.  That is the type of measure we would like to see happen through Creative Ireland.  It should be used to explore our natural and cultural heritage in a new way to allow us to meet new audiences.<\/p> <p>  I would be keen to ensure that the heritage spend keeps up to par with the new programmes that are coming into place, that we do not forget the asset on which all these areas are dependent, and to make sure to fund that appropriately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Clerkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":966,"content":"<p>To pick up on a number of the points the members raised, they said we are very positive.

Everyone is positive, but there are issues, not least of which is the one of capacity and resources, which I touched on earlier.  In the past 20 years, the Heritage Council has shown what is possible within the sector through a new way of working and at community level.  The opportunity that needs to be taken now is to get the State to invest fully in that as well as in what I spoke about, namely, the properties it owns.  There is a real need to get that investment.  We looked for approximately &euro;2 million this year.  We got &euro;200,000.  I know we will be working with the Department over the course of the coming years to try to address that again.  As I remain positive, I never believe we could say we will stop trying to get an increase in resources.  There is a lot going on behind the scenes.<\/p> <p>  The legislative priorities are very relevant.  Currently, the Heritage Council is working as an advisory body helping with reviews of national parks legislation.  There is no such body in Ireland, which is not a normal situation in itself in comparison to other European countries.  The Minister is currently examining the wildlife legislation.

It has been sitting around for a long time but I am hopeful it will be brought forward.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the different approaches to doing things, some years ago, the council proposed to the Department what I would refer to as enabling and empowering legislation.  That encourages communities and allows them to identify what they want to do and then come forward with a programme and a plan that would be supported through strategic funding.  The initial proposal was coined as a landscape Ireland Bill because landscape was seen as embracing where people live, work and visit.  That proposal still exists.

Already, stories and poetry are being written about it but it is still very painful in people's memories.<\/p> <p>  When the Senator mentioned the issue of the metal detectors, I was reminded of the recent find in Donegal a few months ago.<\/p><p>That was through farming, the traditional way of sourcing finds.  That is the ideal way to source a find.  It was great that when that find was discovered, our colleagues from the National Museum travelled up literally overnight and it was on display the next day in Donegal County Museum.  That is the way local communities need to work together so that it is shown in its county before it travels for research.<\/p><p> It is fantastic that the committee visited the National Library.  I cannot but imagine that Dr. Sandra Collins was thrilled about that.  The National Library is one of those institutions that is long overdue attention.  I visited recently looking at the changing facilities and how they will provide a service to the public while they put so much of their material in store, in order improve their storage facilities but, more particularly, in order to improve their public-facing engaging facilities.  What they have programmed coming down the track is fantastic.<\/p><p> When one has collections, it is difficult to manage them.  The National Museum, which is, in fact, over four sites, has vast collections to manage.  The National Gallery took the decision during its refurbishment programme to keep everything on-site no matter what was the best way to protect it.  There is no perfect solution to this problem.  Glasgow has formed a storage facility where several of their museums house their collections and it is accessible.  However, it cost a great deal to set that up and maintain it and for the staff to make it available to the public.  The institutions are working with the Department, the OPW and other bodies to see how they can better manage their collections, particularly at a time when conservation is becoming eco-friendly.  There are new approaches to conservation that are not as rigorous as those in the past.  Senator Warfield's comments were well made.  In this arena, it is welcome to be discussing a subject like this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Marie Bourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives and officials for coming in today for what has been an interesting conversation.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate them on their work, as a starting point.  Both the Heritage Council and each of the individual heritage officers, who we all would deal with in our own capacity in our counties on a regular basis, particularly on built heritage and around heritage week, play a crucial role.  The council also plays a key role.  I might not engage on a day to day basis with it but I am acutely aware of that.<\/p> <p>  I am struck by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point that heritage can be seen as a negative.  I see ways in which in the past 20 years the Heritage Council has redressed that balance.  The linkages between the Heritage Council and agricultural schemes such as REPS, and now GLAS, have been positive because farmers normally saw a heritage monument on their land as a negative where somebody was traipsing over their ground and there was a concern about being sued.  It is positive that it could form part of one the environmental schemes to be enhanced.  I recognise the role the Heritage Council plays in that.<\/p> <p>  I am chairman of the Friends of Athy Heritage Centre and Museum in south Kildare.  The depth of heritage in Athy is phenomenal.  Predominantly because it is an unemployment black spot and we have many challenges, heritage is blamed unfairly for a great deal.  If I am on local radio speaking of the positives of heritage, it will be said to me afterwards that heritage has held the town back but it has not.  One tries to show people the potential that Ireland's Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartland have to open up people's minds.  In all those spaces, tourism in particular can show what can be done.<\/p> <p>  To touch on some of the points that were made earlier, what the heritage centre and museum is doing in Athy is interesting.  On the points made about the Magdalen laundries, part of the issue might be that this is so recent and so raw.  No doubt recognising in one's place the heritage of that place is what will people will buy into.  I refer to those who are not initially passionate about heritage and have a passing interest only.  One pulls them in through linkages to their own area.  In Athy Heritage Centre, the section commemorating local people who died in the First World War is most interesting.  That is how one makes the linkages.  People say such a person was a relation of theirs and they trace back their roots; that has got them in the door.  Then they learn about Ernest Shackleton and the connections there and about the different elements of the centre.<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal more we have to do.  The Heritage Council needs much more support.  I completely understand that and it comes across clearly here.  I look at sites, such as the Curragh plains, in south Kildare and see considerable potential.  The Curragh needs an overall heritage management plan and I work closely with Ms Bridget Loughlin and the good people in Kildare County Council to try to develop that.  There are numerous agencies involved.<\/p> <p>  I am struck by the fact that Mr. Starrett stated there is no legislation for national parks.  That is something on which he might expand.  The Curragh is not a national park although I would like it to be.  There is a means through which one can look to have a place designated but in terms of its overall management, Mr. Starrett might come back to me.  I thank him for his presentation.<\/p> <p>  Heritage officers come under the remit of the Heritage Council but are members of staff of the local authorities.  I am conscious they pointed out that, like arts officers, they are under a different Department than the local authorities themselves.  Are the heritage officers suggesting it would be better if they were under the local authority structure completely?  I am not convinced.  If heritage officers were directly answerable to the busy Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, there would be a risk of them being overlooked.  I am conscious of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's points on a stand-alone Department.  The Constitution states we can have only 15 senior Ministers and Departments.  Unless there is to be one cut, such as children and youth affairs or agriculture, or we hold a referendum, that will not change any time soon.  There are linkages between culture and heritage.  We must get the balance back.  It is evident, in terms of funding, that in the future we need an increased focus on heritage to ensure that balance is correct.  I am not convinced that it needs necessarily to be set alone but the heritage officers definitely need more support in what they are doing.<\/p> <p>  On Ms Clerkin's point on the possibility of an assistant heritage officer role, she stated that is a request she put in to the Heritage Council.  I am sure Mr. Starrett would need more funds for that to happen.  I presume Ms Clerkin is not saying that for Mr. Starrett to press a button.  Is that something Mr. Starrett needs support directly from the Department for?<\/p> <p>  In that regard, I do not know how the individual heritage officers manage.  The key role that heritage officers play in each of the countries is engaging with local communities.  Both Dr. Gallagher and Ms Clerkin made it clear.  There is no point in somebody coming down from Dublin telling people their heritage.  One needs to help the local community to see what is important and let the community develop it.  I am aware that involves a lot of hand-holding.  There are some really good people who volunteer their time, and whether they are applying for built heritage schemes or the development of county heritage plans, there is a great deal of work.  It is not practical to think that it is down on one person.  I ask the heritage officers to expand on what support they need to be able to get that assistant heritage officer role because it is important.<\/p> <p>  So that I am clear on how it works, will they state whether the role of the conservation officer is merely a planning authority role?  Do conservation officers come under the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?  The work of heritage officers is something we as a committee should support.  Their work in enabling local communities to ensure there is local ownership and buy-in of community initiatives is key.<\/p> <p>  Are the heritage officers happy with the plans, in terms of resources?  Do they need more resources to implement the existing heritage plans or do the plans need beefing up?  Are they happy enough with the structure?  If and when we get additional resources, where best can they be spent and directed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#K00200","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":970,"content":"<p>I am not suggesting that we should come under the other Department.

They would need an increase in their budget to provide that support to us and the local authorities.  I think that model has worked very well and that is the way that model should continue.<\/p><p> Conservation officers, for people who do not know, work within local authorities specifically with structures that are protected under the Planning and Development Act, formerly known as listed buildings.  These are structures from 1700 onwards.  Conservation officers primarily work within the planning sphere, dealing with exempted developments, section 57 declarations and that type of thing and do not really engage with communities in the same way we do.  They primarily work within planning, although there would be some overlap, but it is a different role entirely.  It is not community focused, it is focused on the building itself.<\/p><p> Did I cover all of the questions?

In an Irish context, and still in some other European countries, the national park works on a model where the State owns the land and decides it is a national park.  That would be less contemporary than most European countries, which would have dedicated national park legislation based not only on nature conservation but on socioeconomic and rural development needs as well.  There is a need for that to be looked at in the context of the upland areas.  Our national parks do a fantastic job, but they are very restricted in terms of the location and resources that are put their way.  There has been a modest increase, I understand, in their allocation this year but, again, the legislation needs to be there for the legislators to really buy-in and see the value of it, and I welcome the fact that the Department is looking at that at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I have a particular interest in that because my background was in national and regional parks in the UK and France.  I have made an art of looking at models and the ways in which countries cope with this type of situation.  One of the issues, of course, in an Irish context was the resistance to the use of the term \"national\" for anything that was considered privately owned.  That is an obstacle that needs to be overcome.  Every other European country has overcome it with good and targeted legislation.  The French regional and national parks are now focused on socioeconomic development.  That is their ultimate purpose.  It is a shame that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae is not here at the moment because it is really targeting rural depopulation and the decline in rural areas, so there is a job of work that could be done and heritage can play its part.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the need for capacity, the Deputy asked if we are happy.  No, we are never happy with the resources and I will check the figures but I think that, in terms of our budget allocation at the moment, we are around 2006 or 2007 levels.  The Heritage Council took a 65% cut in its allocation and has never recovered that.  Within the context of our new strategic plan and the working arrangements with the Department at the moment, I hope that is addressed in the course of the lifetime of this plan.<\/p> <p>  Where do the resources go?  It is important to say that, during that time of cuts, the community-led sectors, exemplified by heritage, all knuckled down.  They took the bad news, as did we all.  They survived.  They upped their ante.  They did more for less, but that can only be done for so long.  There is a point where that piece of elastic can be stretched to breaking point.  There needs now to be some acknowledgement, recognition and not taking for granted of the community-led voluntary sector and we need to make sure the resources and capacity are provided to allow that to happen.  I hope that comes through the Heritage Council as this plan is implemented.<\/p> <p>  The council's board, as represented here by Ms Marie Bourke, has a number of new initiatives and ideas and wants not only to build on what has happened over the past 20 years, but make sure that we address these contemporary issues.  They touch on climate change and it is clear the role that heritage can play in that.  It may sound as though it is a far stretch but again I appreciate, in the absence of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, that he touched on the value of heritage-led regeneration to help overcome some of the housing crisis.  It does not solve it, but it can play its part if it is properly resourced.<\/p> <p>  Our work has always tried to support the local level delivery of a service, and we are a public service and that is what we are focused on.  I welcome the positive responses from all members of the committee to the way in which services at local level could be bolstered.  That is something that the Heritage Council has listened to heritage officers about but the Heritage Council would know itself as well.  Given the capacity and resources, the Heritage Council would be only too pleased to achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Starrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":975,"content":"<p>I have one or two questions of my own.

Taking the conservation of traditional buildings as an example, the GLAS scheme was mentioned, exemplified through the traditional farm buildings grant scheme the Heritage Council operates.  That allows for increased capacity at local level to conserve a very important aspect of our built heritage.  It also develops traditional building skills.  Back in 2009, there was an all-Ireland report on traditional building skills which identified a need for training and capacity building in that area and, ten years on, there is still that need for investment in the development of those skills.  That development of skills provides employment opportunities.  We see it in Donegal, with our traditional building stock there and the work that is being done.  There is employment for thatchers and traditional craftsmen like those who build and repair sash windows.<\/p> <p>  It is all about enhancing the local communities in which people live.  They want to retain that aspect of their heritage because they are rightly proud of that and want to promote it.  Visitors to our island want to see those aspects of our built heritage.  Those types of programmes, with all those different types of aspects at local level, for locals and visitors to the area, for the skills sector and employment, are all very positive.  <\/p> <p>  One thing we have done in Donegal every couple of years is to run vernacular architecture seminars for the owners or occupiers of these traditional buildings, to encourage them to conserve them.  We are oversubscribed every time we run it.  Between 120 and 140 people attend on a Saturday morning to hear different experts talking about how to conserve their buildings, make them liveable, bring them back into use and then, in the afternoon, we have traditional craftsmen showing the practice of traditional skills.  These are skills that are very much accessible to the local community.  There is not necessarily a need for experts, but rather just a bit of direction and some of that work can be done by the owners or occupiers themselves.  As we all know, the best way to conserve a building is to keep it in use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.  I represent an area which is, in many ways, spoiled for choice.  Dublin South-Central includes Kilmainham, Inchicore and quite a number of buildings in terms of built heritage in particular, but there are also the canals and the Liffey and all of that.  Much of my time in the area has been spent encouraging, though little encouragement is needed, and working with different aspects of local communities in trying to enhance or exploit heritage for the community and put it on show for people coming to look at it.<\/p><p>We have been quite successful in recent times.  We managed to get the local authority to buy an old mill that NAMA was holding from us - Kilmainham Mill.  The question now is what to do with it.  A plan has been there over the years.  It is great when we have a success like that because we have lost so much over the years.  It allowed the committee to go into schools.  I think two of the representatives had a far greater understanding of how the mill was used than most of us on the committee and now visit and present to local schools.  The mill was in operation up until the 1980s.  There is footage of it in operation.  People, including my grandfather, remember it.  Suddenly, matters have been stirred.  Once we stir people, be it with regard to history, heritage or whichever way we want to describe it because it is so vast, it acts as a spark, particularly for many young people.  It gets them to switch off gadgets and they look at their own areas in a different way.<\/p><p> We will be dealing with the museums in the near future.  New technology can be an advantage, particularly in the context of storage.  My father worked in a museum for many years.  I remember the scary stories he told me about storage.  To my knowledge, some of that is still happening.  In this day and age, everything should be catalogued and made available online regardless of whether it is going to be in a box forever more.  I do not mind.  The idea is that somehow or other, it is accessible to the public.  We cannot put everything on display but people should know that we have it and protect it and that it is available.<\/p><p> There are two areas in which I do not have expertise so I might be wrong about them.  Bord na M&oacute;na has just announced the ending of peat-fired energy generation and the cutting of turf in vast areas.  I do not know whether our guests have given some thought to this.  What will we do with the heritage?  Is this an opportunity for us to reintegrate some of the species - what was before?  How do we interact with that?  The Minister might tell us at some stage and invite submissions because it is so vast and gives us an opportunity to do a lot of stuff for which we did not have money or the vision in the past.<\/p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has left.  I thought he might have raised the next issue, which is how we protect some of our heritage sites in particular from the likes of rhododendron and Japanese knotweed?  In the past, I saw a newspaper report that the men's sheds had gone down to Killarney to get stuck.  Well done to them.  From the little knowledge I have of rhododendron, I think they need to be on site every weekend for the next ten years to undo some of the damage and resurrect parts of the national parks.  In my area, Japanese knotweed has held up a social housing project for a year because of questions about how to treat it so it does not just affect our heritage sites.  It also affects future sites.<\/p><p> I thank our guests for quite an enlightening presentation.  I have taken my own scribbled notes because if the Minister comes before us again soon, there are a number of points we can raise directly with her.  Alternatively, we might write to the Department to see whether it will give consideration to the assistant heritage officers.  If we achieve nothing else over the next year, we will have done a lot to help the Heritage Council, the local authorities and ourselves.  The local authority in my area has done tremendous work and I have worked with it on saving too many buildings at this stage.  Some people say that this is all I am involved in.  Prior to the restoration of Richmond Barracks, the local authority worked with the library service and put a call out to the community in the Kilmainham-Inchicore area to carry out an audit of material.  I had not seen this previously.  It was held in a hall and anybody with any bit of history was told to come along.  The material was photographed and scanned.  The library service now has a log of a lot of material that is not held in museums.  It knows where it is and what it is about and has interacted with them since then.  This was a big job and it took place on a Saturday.  I saw more weapons on that day than I have seen all my life.  It was interesting because it was a barracks.  People brought old memorabilia from the days when British soldiers were there and when the national forces took over the barracks in 1922, bits and pieces from soldiers who had been abroad and people who worked in CI&Eacute; and items of general historical interest.  The barracks has the roll books of the school that was set up there in 1924.  There are data protection considerations as some characters are still alive and there are little notes about them so we must be careful.  They are on show in a roll book.  The museum there is very small but it does something of which I am proud.  We wanted to do a lot more but it is only a small building.  I will leave it at that.  Again, I thank our guests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018111400002#L00700","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542202200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>From our perspective, it is a very welcome thing for us to be here to listen to members' comments and to present and give our answers, particularly regarding the Heritage Council's new plan and strategy, which is being launched in 2018 - European Year of Cultural Heritage.

They have done a lot but they can only do so much.  I will return to the question about legislation.  If there was a framework with empowering and enabling legislation that allowed local authorities and communities to identify what was needed for their areas and for areas to be designated as regional parks or something along those lines, as happens in the rest of Europe, there would be a legislative framework in which this issue of Bord na M&oacute;na could be addressed.  There is an opportunity there and I hope the Heritage Council will help.<\/p><p> Heritage officers have been very active on the invasive species.  The rhododendron and Japanese knotweed were mentioned.  There is very good science now through the national biodiversity data centre.  The national biodiversity data centre is the hub through which information on the spread of all invasive species, whether rhododendron or Japanese knotweed, are accessed.  In terms of what can be done about it, it is very difficult.  They are invasive species and the solutions are not easy.

It works very closely with and complements the Heritage Council's plan.  One of the things the Department has just initiated is an open public consultation.  It is a very good time to alert people in one's own area to be vigilant to that consultation.  It is very keen to involve as many people as possible in expressing their views and opinions about what can be done for Irish heritage.  It is a really good way to get everybody to articulate their thoughts.

I am joined on my left by the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy Griffin.  I am also joined by officials of the Department: Ken Spratt, Peter Hogan, Noel Sheahan and James Lavelle.  With the permission of the Chairman, I propose to share my speaking time with my colleague, the Minister of State.  Deputy Griffin and I had the privilege of launching the national sports policy towards the end of July at a wonderful venue in central Dublin, the Laurence O&rsquo;Toole Recreation Centre on Sheriff Street.  Many people came together on that day to showcase the best of the north east inner city community as local people of all ages participated in a variety of sporting activities on a gloriously sunny day.  In so many ways it was the perfect start for this ten year policy.  I wish to extend my thanks once again to all concerned.<\/p> <p>  There are three high-level goals in this national sports policy: increased participation across all sports in Ireland; more excellence in terms of governance as well as in the sporting arena; and improved capacity to allow for more people to get involved in sport and for those already engaged in sport to improve standards across the board.  Our ultimate ambition is for every citizen to engage regularly in some form of sport and physical activity, irrespective of their background or their physical capabilities.  We want to raise Ireland to the top of the table for participation.<\/p> <p>  To achieve the aims of the policy it is clear that we must prioritise certain groups to help them to engage more in sport and be more physically active generally.  The committee members know as well as I do the extraordinary benefits this can deliver for people&rsquo;s physical health and mental well-being.  When we launched the policy we highlighted a number of priorities, such as the need to accelerate our women in sport programme by doubling the annual funding provision from &euro;1 miilion to &euro;2 million in 2019.  While the gender gap in sports participation is narrower now than at any point over the past ten years, at just 4.5%, I am determined to eliminate that gap altogether.  I am very pleased that the necessary funding is in place to begin that journey in 2019.  <\/p> <p>  Many of the great Irish sporting successes this year have been achieved by women and the list of achievements over the past 12 months has been phenomenal.  To name but a few, we have been enthralled by brilliant moments such as the remarkable run of the women&rsquo;s hockey team to the World Cup final; the International Association of Athletics Federations, IAAF, World U20 Championships successes for Sommer Lecky and the women&rsquo;s 4 x 100 m relay squad; the European Athletics U18 Championships medals for Rhasidat Adeleke, Sarah Healy and Sophie O&rsquo;Sullivan; and our medal wins at the World Para Athletics European Championships and the World Para Swimming Allianz European Championships, which were hosted here in Dublin during August.<\/p> <p>  Our Paralympic sports stars provide a welcome illustration of another area of priority, which is to provide increased opportunities for people with a disability to participate in sport.  To drive this initiative, funding has been provided in the 2019 Estimates to introduce a dedicated &euro;1 million programme for disability sport, which will facilitate the deployment of a sport inclusion disability officer in all 26 local sports partnerships countrywide.<\/p> <p>  We have set ourselves a number of ambitious targets, and I would like to highlight some of them today.  We aim to increase overall participation in sport from 43% to 50% of the population by 2027.  That means the equivalent of 250,000 more people<\/p> <p>participating in sport in nine years time.<\/p><p>Our high performance funding will be more targeted in order to deliver more Olympic and Paralympic medals.  We are aiming for 20 medals for the Los Angeles games in 2028.  We also want to see the adoption by all funded sports bodies of the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity sector.<\/p><p> I reiterate my thanks to Mr. John Treacy and all at Sport Ireland for their commitment to Irish sport.  They have shown great leadership in the fight against doping in sport and are leading the call for reform in the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA.  At the recent anti-doping summit in the White House, the high regard in which Mr. Treacy and his team at Sport Ireland are held among their peers was abundantly clear.  We will never tolerate anything which compromises the integrity of our sports and that message is emphasised in this policy.<\/p><p> We are also determined to continue our investment in sports facilities through the sports capital programme and the new large-scale sports infrastructure fund.  The ongoing development of the Sport Ireland national sports campus is proof that Ireland is committed to excellence and opportunity in sport.  This is an historic document that for the first time outlines the Government&rsquo;s vision for sport and reminds us all of its importance in our heritage and culture.  We want to ensure sport remains at the heart of our society.  More important, we want to see Irish people of all abilities taking part in some sport or physical activity each day for the benefit of their physical and mental health.<\/p><p> I will now hand over to the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, to comment on policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#C00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>As the Minister has just outlined, the publication of the national sports policy demonstrates this Government's recognition of the value of sport to our nation.  I know from first-hand experience how playing sport is positively associated with better educational performance and provides young people with life skills such as goal setting, self-improvement, social skills, working in a team or alone to achieve something personally rewarding.  Sport can teach us so much about the value of commitment to a worthwhile objective, discipline and many other personal skills.<\/p> <p>  It is clear how much Irish society has benefited from the contribution of sports clubs and volunteers in our towns and villages.  These selfless individuals provide so many people with an outlet to express themselves through sport.  A fantastic aspect of sport is that one can have a lifelong relationship with it, whether as a participant, coach, administrator, volunteer or supporter and it is especially pleasing to note that we are seeing so many people staying active for longer.  The contribution of sport and physical activity to our country is significant.  Its contribution to tackling the challenge of obesity and sedentary lifestyles is critical to maintaining a healthy population.  We all benefit when our citizens spend more time off the couch and spend that time in the gym, going for a walk or cycle or getting out on the playing field.  <\/p> <p>  The consultation process which preceded the publication of the national sports policy reiterated how much credit is due to the national governing bodies of sport, the local sports partnerships and other sporting organisations for promoting sport in Ireland.  This policy takes account of that extraordinary contribution and presents a vision for sport in 2027 that is based on inspiration for our people; involvement and enjoyment by participants and spectators; and excellence from our high performance athletes.  The policy contains 57 actions and is backed up with an envisaged doubling of State investment in sport to &euro;220 million in 2027. <\/p> <p>  The Government recognises the scale of the challenge we face and is committed to increasing support to achieve our shared ambition.  The Minister and I made the case very strongly for an increase in the 2019 Estimates and we have made a really good start that has been widely welcomed by the sports sector.  The Minister and I have worked closely on the make-up of the sports leadership group, which is to be co-chaired by us.  We are very excited by the establishment of that group.  The ambitions of the policy are significant and a lot of work will be required to achieve them all but it has been clear from the launch of the policy that the sporting community in this country is eager to see those targets met which is very heartening and encouraging.<\/p> <p>  I want to continue to see Irish sportsmen and women inspiring the generations to follow in their footsteps, whether at club or county level in Gaelic games, national teams performing in World Cups, European Championships and across the international arena, or athletes across all disciplines competing with the best in the Olympics and Paralympics.  There is nothing more uplifting than seeing our own sporting heroes representing us, with the eyes of the world watching.  We know that to keep on inspiring our young people we need to do all we can to help our high performance sports people prepare to the same level as their rivals.  Increasing the level of our high performance investment is essential and I have stated my aim to treble the level of financial support to around &euro;30 million over the next decade.  <\/p> <p>  The availability of quality sports facilities also has a big impact on raising performance standards.  We continue to invest significant resources through the sports capital programme, as well as the new large-scale sports infrastructure fund.  The latest round of the sports capital fund closed just last month and we received a record 2,337 applications, again emphasising how important the scheme is for clubs and communities throughout the country.  The Sport Ireland national sports campus is also going to be further developed.<\/p> <p> I would like to endorse the Minister&rsquo;s observations about the sterling work of Mr. John Treacy, Kieran Mulvey and all in Sport Ireland for ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s sporting sector continues to develop.  I thank them especially for leading the fight for a clean sporting landscape internationally, while still providing opportunities for all the citizens of Ireland to get active and get involved in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#D00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State.

I am not sure when the last one was published but this new policy is much needed in order to plan a pathway forward for sport in Ireland.  The targets set out in the policy document are ambitious.  While the benefits of sport cannot be overstated in the context of elite sport's ability to lift the spirit of the nation, as we saw with the achievement of the women's hockey team earlier this year as well as the achievements of the rugby team over many years, increasing participation in sport generally is crucial.  That aim must run parallel to the aim of supporting elite sport.  While elite sport can lift a nation, increased participation can make us a healthier nation.<\/p> <p>  A report was launched recently on disability and access to transport which was aspirational in nature.  In many respects, this national sports policy document is also aspirational and its success will depend on its implementation in the coming years.  Reference was made to \"targeted funding\" for sports in which we have a better chance of success.  Recent examples of success include in rowing, hockey and so on.  Are we going to target sports in which we have a better chance of winning medals or are we going to invest more in high profile sports at which we have not been particularly successful?  How will that targeting happen?  Will it be up to the governing bodies to make the case for additional funding by arguing that they can win three or four Olympic medals?  A few years ago, for example, following the success of our boxers at international level, considerable funding was provided for that sport.  However, the performance of our boxers at the last Olympic Games was disappointing.  Does funding disappear if the medals disappear?  Sometimes sports need more help when they are not successful in order to get to medal-winning level.  How will the targeted funding aspect work in terms of the connection between the Sports Council and the governing bodies?  <\/p> <p>  Reference was also made to inequalities in sport and in that context, women in sport is a big issue at present.  There has been a big effort on the part of governing bodies in recent times to promote women in sport and rightly so.<\/p><p>I am a member of a committee which is trying to produce leaders in ladies' Gaelic football.  At the ladies' all-Ireland finals we see the two teams but most of the time the referees and managers are male.  There is a big need to change that and fully achieve the potential for women in sport.  Can the Minister expand on and explain the increase in funding this year from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million for the annual women in sport programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#D00400","speaker":"1426","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>We were all delighted by the launch of the sports policy document last July.  It is a welcome document.  It was ten years since the previous document for a sports programme was launched.  We hope it is not just an aspiration because documents can be put on shelves.  I hope we do not have to depend on kneejerk reactions.  For example, when the ladies' hockey team did well on the world stage the Minister was able to find money straightaway to advance their sport and other Olympic sports.<\/p> <p>  The funding has been doubled from &euro;111 million to &euro;250 million.  When will the target spending be achieved?  Will that be before the ten-year period ends?  I know it will increase in increments but will the increments be within a five, seven or ten-year period?  We may not see the programme fully implemented.  The Minister of State said there are 57 actions, largely to increase participation in all types of sport.  High performance sports are the ones that everyone watches on TV and wants to get involved in the following morning, and there are various sports codes, team and individual.  Schools have to be considered to ensure that students of all ages are involved and there have to be recreational activities for those who cannot participate actively.  We must not lose sight of people with disabilities.  An hour ago we launched a programme on disabled access to transport.  It is a case of whether we can deliver these programmes on time and within schedule.  There are many targets but what timeframes are there for each target for the people who are following in the Minister's footsteps?  Money will be the big thing.  We welcome the funding and commitment but money is the backbone of any project. <\/p> <p>  I thank the various governing bodies such as Sport Ireland, the Federation of Irish Sport and the revamped Olympic Council of Ireland and the Olympic Federation of Ireland, which has made great strides since the debacle in Rio.  I hope they will all work hand in hand.  The Minister was in America recently.  He has already committed money to the anti-doping programme.  Is that guaranteed?  We commend the emphasis on anti-doping but will we be at a deficit in activating the overall participation programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#E00200","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the sports policy 2018-2027.

To increase participation in minority sports we will need to give more proactive support to this sector as opposed to reactive support as it has been in the past.

He mentioned it in his address.  Somehow he hopes to garner some of the goodwill from their success.  That hockey team pulled itself up by its bootlaces to achieve what it achieved.  We are reacting with support and by all means I welcome the support for that team now but the support was not there when the team needed it in its infancy.  That is what we need to focus on in this policy document, to ensure that the support is there when needed, not when there are cameras present, when there is publicity but in the quiet, out of the public glare, so that we do see an increase in participation.<\/p><p>Yesterday the Irish rugby star, Louise Galvin was quoted in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  The article stated:<\/p><blockquote>Curbs on playground games as well as limited or no PE sessions can leave many children at risk of not meeting the recommended 60 minutes' exercise a day.  Often it's the PE hall in school that's the first to go if there is a concert or exam going on. [...] Ms Galvin, who is a qualified physiotherapist and is now doing a masters in sports and exercise medicine at the University of Ulster, said parents could think of basic ways to get their children active at home. [...] Ms Galvin is an ambassador for the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists [...] She said children learn a lot more from sport, especially when it comes to mistakes and dealing with disappointment. They learn it's ok to fail.  &quot;Sport also gives more balance to the young pupil's life and has huge concentration benefits for study,&quot; she added [...] &quot;Girls in sport have better self-images and more confidence.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>That sums it up well.  As the Minister is aware, many local authorities the length and breadth of the country are picking up the tab or partially picking up the tab to pay for development officers in their municipal areas.  In Westmeath we partly fund development officers in the GAA and rugby and some of my colleagues tell me that has extended to cricket and other areas.  Is the Minister happy that local authorities are funding this?  It is welcome that they are but it is not the ideal funding stream.<\/p><p>The other half is being funded by sporting bodies.<\/p><p> Obesity in younger people is one of the greatest challenges facing Ireland, and how we encourage greater participation in sports is so important.  Yesterday's article mentioned the fostering of a culture of competitiveness from an early age, ensuring that people realise it is okay to fail in sports but it is also important to be competitive.  If we do not foster competitiveness at an early age, how will we achieve targets set down for Olympic medals?  We are often compared with New Zealand because we are similar in population but it beats us in achievements on the sporting fields.  That country fosters a culture of competitiveness.  Have we a clear plan on how to achieve our target for Olympic medals?  Will we focus on a number of key supports where we feel we have the most realistic chance or how is it envisaged that the target will be achieved?<\/p><p> The Minister and the Minister of State mentioned the quality of sporting facilities.  Our sports capital programme must be acknowledged for the success it is.  When will the large-scale sports infrastructure fund finally be opened?  Responses to parliamentary questions indicate it will open \"shortly\" for months.  Is it possible for the Minister to give a clear timeframe on that?  Many sporting bodies await the opening of the fund.<\/p><p> One of the key targets is the adoption by all funded sports bodies of the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity sector.  It is critical in light of what happened at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and what transpired with the Olympic Council of Ireland.  What percentage of our sporting bodies meet the governance code currently?  Is there a large body of work to be done to bring the sporting bodies to a standard where they could fulfil the governance code requirements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#E00500","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>The Minister identified the need for increased participation but what actions have been planned and what areas or groups have been identified that need specific targeting for increased participation?  The sports capital grant has been annualised and it is my understanding is that the scheme is to be reviewed.  There was a fiasco last year with the allocations.  Has the Department identified improvements in the way the grant allocations will be made?  Perhaps disadvantaged areas with the least number of facilities could receive a ring-fenced percentage of grant allocations.  They are at a disadvantage because they have fewer facilities and less funding than others.  Increasing participation is all the harder if the facilities or resources are not in a locality.

A national sports policy is welcome.  The goal is to increase participation in all sports in Ireland.  Many years ago soccer had \"Participation Through Fun\" and once we get people participating, it is wonderful.  There was mention of the remarkable run of the women's hockey team to the world cup final.  I highlight it again.  It is not just for the Minister and Minister of State but I wanted to work on an all-Ireland hockey team to play in the Commonwealth Games last year.  We did not get the buy-in from many of the various organisations in a political sense or nationally.  The Commonwealth Games take place every four years or midway between Olympic Games.  What is happening in national sports is incredible but the Commonwealth Games are an extra goal that could be worked towards.  It is a political issue in some senses but the games have 52 participants, 32 of which are republics.  It has a potential audience of 2.4 billion people.  Our enhanced participation could ensure that athletes in the Republic of Ireland would have the same opportunities as people in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I seek the views of the Minister and Minister of State on this despite the controversy.  We are beginning to come of age, if we consider what happened last Sunday and the centenary of the armistice, as well as what is to happen during the decade of commemorations.  We have come a long way.<\/p> <p>  I am amazed that there are still 2,337 applications for the sports capital fund.  I would have thought that after 15 or 20 years many sports organisations would have developed and installed many floodlights, pitches, training grounds and dressing rooms.  It is a great sign that we are not just talking about three or four core sports and many others are seeking funding.  Have we reached out to many other sports around the country, including minority sports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#F00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I thank members for their contributions.  Before the Minister responds, I will make a few points.  I welcome the significant funding that is being provided for sport in this programme, which is important.  The key point we must never forget is the health gain for people, particularly those who do not participate in sport throughout their lives.  That is a major gain, bringing increased longevity, the avoidance of heart disease and other issues.  The core of our public health policy should be about giving everybody an equal chance to live to the best of their ability.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Munster's comments on disadvantaged areas and allocating a significant portion of funding to them.  It was mentioned in the document.  We need that positive discrimination.  I support the sports at the top, including GAA, soccer and rugby, but few people have the potential to get to the top.  It is important to place an even greater emphasis on inclusivity and people getting involved as young as possible.  This takes in the facilities they use.  John and Mary going to primary school would know about the activities mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, including a two-mile run.  It is a good idea and those kinds of activities are important in the development of a healthier population.<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to older people.<\/p><p>As people age, they sometimes get grey hair but their brains do not atrophy.  Certainly, their bodies get slower.  While it is mentioned in the national sports strategy, we need a greater awareness of the need to include older people who will not be as involved in soccer, Gaelic and rugby as they were.  We need a proactive policy.  Ideas like a park run or walk are good.  It could be 2 km or 5 km.  We need to think about it in connection with the Department of Health and Sport Ireland to ensure there is a greater emphasis on the inclusion of older people and on activities they can easily get involved in.  I would welcome that.  I do not know about Deputy Munster, but I have to leave at approximately 2.40 p.m. to deal with a Topical Issue matter in the D&aacute;il.  I will ask Deputy O'Keeffe to take the Chair if we are not finished by then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#F00400","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister of State to start and I will follow up on each question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#G00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Mahony for his comments.  I also thank the members of the committee who attended the launch in July.  It was a successful launch and the document was well received.  It is now a matter for all of us to implement and collaborate on.  In reply to Senator O'Mahony, it is the first full and comprehensive sports policy the country has ever had.  While we have had papers previously, there has been nothing as comprehensive as this and nothing that has involved as much consultation with, and feedback from, key stakeholders.  It is a watershed moment for Irish sport and a case now of ensuring we implement everything we want to achieve by 2027.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the high performance element.  Page 56 of the document sets out a detailed outline of the high performance strategy.  I know what the Senator is asking, but it is something of a chicken and egg scenario.  If the money is not put in, a sport is less likely to achieve success.  It is a difficult matter and one which is ultimately for Sport Ireland to administer.  The key is that a new strategy is being put together and implemented on high performance.  A new working group has been established and it will work on a strategy throughout 2019 before presenting its final report at roughly this time next year, if not, hopefully, a little earlier, with a view to setting out a 12-year plan to be reviewed every four years in line with the Olympics cycle.  That is how we hope to do it.  The micro-decisions will be made by Sport Ireland which has an excellent record on high performance and providing for our athletes.  The Senator will be familiar with the campus and its high performance unit which is doing great work.  On capital expenditure, we are trying to provide improved facilities through the development of the campus.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the women in sports programme, the doubling of funding to &euro;2 million was positive.  That funding is distributed to the national governing bodies for sports programmes to target women who are either not participating or who are not as active as they would like to be.  Sport Ireland distributes the funding to the governing bodies which implement the programmes on the ground.  The increased budget we have achieved has helped with the positive results of the programme.  Hopefully, we will increase the funding further in time.<\/p> <p>  When we set the target to move from &euro;111 million to &euro;220 million by 2027 over nine budgets, it implied a projected a requirement to increase the budget by &euro;12 million in 2019 on top of what was there in 2017.  Thankfully, we have secured an increase of &euro;16.5 million in the 14 months between the budget and the end of 2019.  Of that, &euro;15 million is for 2019.  As such, we are ahead of target.  Given the projected average requirement of &euro;12 million over nine budgets, we are off to a good start with &euro;15 million in 2019.  We need to keep going every year because this document will be of no use if the funding is not provided to match it.  However, having the funding is one thing; we need all of the players and stakeholders to get together and ensure they play their part.  That is what the implementation and leadership group is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#G00300","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>Senator O'Mahony addressed the issue of participation and said how important it was to the health of the nation.  The current figure is that only 43% are participating fully now.  We want to get that up to 50% and the questions are how we do it and which groups we target.  The Senator is probably aware that only 23% or 24% of people with disabilities are participating properly in sport.  We aim certainly to target them and other disadvantaged people in a very energetic way.  One of the ways we will do it is through the introduction of a national network of sports inclusion disability officers allied to local sports partnership.  These officers will be expected to work closely with relevant national governing bodies, the disabilities sector, leisure providers, the Cara centre and other stakeholders to provide opportunities for people with disabilities to take part in sport.  We have also increased funding, as the Minister of State said.<\/p> <p>  Senators O'Mahony Feighan asked whether Sport Ireland would target high performance resources at those with the best chance of securing medals.  That is the current aim.  There is a prevailing view that the funds were previously too well spread and that we might be better off to target those with best chance of winning medals.  Deputy Troy referred to New Zealand which has a similar population but a much better medals hit rate.  Whereas medals are not the be all and end all, as Senator O'Mahony emphasised, and participation is equally important, they are important to young people who look to these icons and see that we are successful, which encourages their participation in sport in turn.<\/p> <p>  We have a sports inclusion disability fund which will be targeted at the disabled.

We have been exploring how the two Departments could collaborate better to facilitate the PE curriculum.  It would be a massive cost for any one Department to take on the capital requirements related to PE, for example.  We are interested in seeing whether a broader community benefit could result from the implementation of facilities to facilitate the PE curriculum.  It is going on across all Departments.

That is on top of the Women in Sport programme initiative increase.  This money will allow them to roll out programmes for people.  We have done well on the capital front in recent years but the funding for programmes and people have not really matched it.  This is the first budget where we have seen a substantial increase in the core funding for the national governing bodies which will augur well for on-the-ground programmes and the rolling out of those programmes whether through development officers or other means.  It is very encouraging to see.  If we can keep that momentum going, it will see more people on the ground trying to get more people active in sport.<\/p><p>One of the core principles of the new policy is to see local authorities taking on a more proactive role in involving people in sport.  If one wants to compare the tourism side of the house to the sport side, on the tourism front we have seen a delegation of duty to local authorities in recent years.  It has worked well in most cases.  It is a ground-up approach.  We want to see local authorities getting more involved with local authority plans and working with the local sports partnerships who have an excellent knowledge on the ground of the issues and challenges.  We need to work on the parts of the community where participation is lower than the national average.  I very much welcome local authority involvement and the policy hopes to see more of that in a structured and integrated way.  It will be very important in terms of leading this forward and for local authorities working with the various organisations and clubs in their areas to try to roll out programmes that are not there at present and to make the most of the facilities.  We hope to see a lot of progress on local authority-led audits of sports facilities around the country by next year.  They will establish where we have facilities in abundance and also where we are lacking to see how we can best address gaps.  We can adjust the policy based on the outcome of that.

We are specifically trying to target those groups with a very comprehensive approach led by numerous agencies, the national governing bodies, local sports partnerships, which already operate in that sphere, and local authorities.

Education and training boards can also apply.  It is an area which is covered by that element.  While we could go into the business of financing the purchase of land, which is something I remember hearing discussed as far back as 2012 when the programme was being reintroduced, there are a number of caveats to note.  It could lead to price inflation in facilities if it was known that a Government grant was available for purchases.  One also gets into a whole new territory in terms of where one is going with sports capital.  It is not only a question of buying land but of developing it.  As such, it is a very different area.  There is already a great deal of land in the ownership of agencies which is not being used at all for any purpose, and we need local authorities and agencies to be as resourceful as possible with assets they already have.  The programme is open to them.<\/p><p>Deputy Munster asked also about the scoring system.  We published the scoring system from the last round and we are working to finalise the detail of the current scoring system.  We want to be as fair as possible to everyone.  The 2017 programme was the first sports capital programme round in which the funding announced was directly proportionate to the scores achieved by the applicants.  In the case of minority sports, it is important to note that the 2017 programme was open to everybody and that for the first time ever, every valid application was approved for funding.  There was no exclusion of minority sports or smaller sporting bodies and everyone who received a score got funding.  It varied from county to county because of the <i>per capita<\/i>system.  An applicant that received 80 points in Leitrim did not get the same amount as an applicant that got 80 points in Cork.  That is perhaps one of the flaws of the programme and it may be that we can review it as we strengthen the scoring system.  I am very proud of the 2017 programme and that we have a very transparent and accountable system in place.<\/p><p>I cannot read my own writing and am not sure what Deputy Munster's last question was.

I might move to Senator Feighan's questions.  I am well aware and pay tribute to the fact that Senator Feighan has for a long time pursued objectives around all-Ireland sports and the Commonwealth Games.  It is a worthy pursuit and one we should address in the context of the fact that Ireland is becoming more and more a global centre of sporting activity.  I am not saying we should suddenly offer to host a lot of events, but the Senator will know there are talks under way on the possibility of hosting the Ryder Cup in 2026.  There are other focal points for sport, including the Euro 2020 soccer tournament, and there is even talk of us co-operating with the UK for the 2030 World Cup.  We are moving into the international sphere and thinking more globally.  Given the great achievements we have had overseas, we are thinking more about co-operating with others.<\/p><p>All-island sport has worked very well in terms of rugby.  The Senator made a very good case for looking at it for other sports but it is as much a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as it is for us.  I am happy to encourage any way the Senator thinks is practical subject to the diplomatic niceties involved, about which, more than anybody, the Senator would be appreciative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#J01200","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his remarks.  We play rugby on an all-island basis.  A total of 70% of people born on the island of Ireland who reside overseas reside in Commonwealth countries.  Deep down, we have this instinct that it is not us but from a legal, educational and political perspective, these people are the same.  We are talking about 2.4 billion people.  We have this reluctance, which should not exist.  We have come an awful long way.  I agree with the Minister concerning the cross-border bid by the IFA and FAI to host the 2023 European Championships.  It is groundbreaking and sends out a signal that on the island of Ireland, what the Department has been doing all along with things like the sports campus is groundbreaking.  What happened last Sunday on the island of Ireland, tens of thousands people in places like Sligo, Dublin, Enniskillen or my home town of Boyle went out and rightly remembered the 200,000 Irish men who served in World War One.  We have come of age and are in a much better space from a historical perspective.  It was under a Fine Gael Government and a Fine Gael Taoiseach, John A. Costello, that we left the Commonwealth in 1949, possibly on a spat because we felt insulted by the Canadian High Commissioner.  There is an awful lot to be gained from sporting links in particular in respect of an issue about which, deep down, we do not talk.  I am sorry for going into that but I thank the Minister for his words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#K00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State wish to comment what the Chairman said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018111400002#K00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1542202200,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>The Chairman raised the issue of the disadvantaged.  I addressed that issue with regard to the sports capital programme.  Again, I emphasise that we are going through the scoring criteria for the 2018 programme.  As soon as we finalise these, we will publish them as we did with regard to the 2017 programme.  We do not do it beforehand because there is a feeling that if we did, we would get the answers we were looking for.  Ultimately, we want to get as accurate a portrayal as possible of the situation with regard to the application form.  We can then adjudicate as fairly as possible by setting our scoring criteria.  If we were to publish them beforehand, everyone would have 100 marks, which is not the way we should be doing it.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman spoke about inclusivity, which is very much national sports policy.  We are trying to get up to 50% participation, reduce the 7:3 percentage and target groups that are not as active at sport and recreation as they should or could be.  It is very much about inclusivity and funding following disability and disadvantage across the board.  That is what we are trying to do.  The Chairman referred to Parkrun, which is a brilliant initiative, and the Daily Mile Ireland.  These are the type of programmes that are working on the ground.  A ground-up approach is very much needed along with Government support facilitating that.

This targets the type of clubs that are without the facilities referred to by the Vice Chairman.  Easing up on the criteria regarding schools involves using State assets that might be currently unavailable and making them available.

I do not want to get into an area that is technically its area.  How it does it, who the funding goes to and where the best prospects are are matters for Sport Ireland working with the NGBs.  We have set our targets in terms of the medal count in future games.  We want to see an increase on what we have achieved in recent games.  Regarding the implementation of that, I am very confident that Sport Ireland, working with the NGBs, will be able to do that.  I look forward to see work on the high performance strategy progress over the next 12 months.  That type of structure is needed so that we can give a bit of certainty to our athletes and get the best possible return for our investment.  That return on our investment is brilliant for the national mood and pride but these are the people who inspire the next generation.  There is a circle.  If we can pump money in to increase the levels of facilities and programmes available to help people participate and start at a young age, there is a greater chance that more people will make it through to high performance.  If we get more people at high performance performing well on the world stage, these people inspire more people to get involved at grassroots level.
