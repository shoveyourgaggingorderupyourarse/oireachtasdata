This is Committee Stage of the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of the Department and the Minister of State.  We have worked closely together to develop these proposals since the Bill passed Second Stage, with a view to reaching broad agreement on the direction of the Bill.  For me and my party, the core objective of this legislation is to ensure that loan ownership becomes a regulated activity, and to change the position which has been in law since 2015, whereby those purchasing loans, whether commercial loans or mortgages, are required to appoint an intermediary who acts as a credit servicing agent or credit servicing firm, and under the 2015 Act, that intermediary has to be a regulated entity.  From my perspective, the loan owner should be directly regulated and accountable to the Central Bank, so that the full suite of powers available to the Central Bank relating to all other regulated entities would apply.  That is the key objective that I have in seeking to advance this legislation.  The litmus test is really whether all of the Central Bank codes apply, such as the consumer protection code, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, and lending to small and medium-sized enterprises regulations, and whether the full suite of powers set out in the 2013 supervision and enforcement legislation applies and is available to the Central Bank so that, if necessary, the Central Bank has the power to inspect, investigate and, if necessary, to take enforcement action.  Those who own the loan and ultimately make all of the important decisions about its future, such as whether a person keeps a home, or about a business or farm, should be directly regulated and accountable to the Central Bank.  The Bill is not a panacea for dealing with all non-performing loan, NPL, issues and arrears, but it is an important and necessary step.<\/p> <p>  Other changes which we have spoken about on many occasions are required.<\/p><p>These include changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That code is being reviewed and my party has proposals in that regard as well.<\/p><p> In recent weeks, since the passage of the Bill on Second Stage, we have worked closely with the Department to essentially rewrite the Bill and put it in a format which can hopefully come through Committee and Remaining Stages and which achieves the core objective of the Bill.<\/p><p> Section 1 is proposed to be deleted.  I have shared with other members our speaking notes on the legislation.<\/p><p> Having considered the matter in more detail and focusing on the objective of ensuring that loan owners are regulated by the Central Bank, I am bringing forward changes to the definitions.  There are advantages to using an existing authorisation regime already in use by the Central Bank rather than creating a new type of regulated entity, the credit agreement owner, as originally proposed.  Therefore, the current definition section is proposed to be deleted and a new set of definitions will be introduced.<\/p><p> There are advantages to using an existing regime.  It means that the Central Bank already has an authorisation process in place and has already set a fitness and probity regime.  Using the credit serving regime that was put in place in 2015 should help Irish regulated firms when the proposed EU directive on credit serving is put in place.<\/p><p> I appreciate the Central Bank recommended that the retail credit firm regime be used and I may wish to return to this on Report Stage.  Members will have read the submission made by the Central Bank to Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach during the scrutiny phase.  The Central Bank came down on the side of opting for the retail credit firm model.  I understand there has been much engagement between the Department and the Central Bank on that point.  The view at present is that availing of the existing framework, in terms of credit serving firm, is the optimum way to go but it is something that we may need to revisit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#A00500","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we have reached Committee Stage on Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill.

I am representing the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who is at ECOFIN today.<\/p> <p>  This is an important piece of legislation and we need to be careful that it does not have unintended consequences.  I acknowledge the interaction between the Department, the Central Bank and the members opposite.<\/p> <p>  The Government was committed to supporting the Bill on Second Stage and followed through on the commitment.  I acknowledge the support of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in developing the amendments proposed.  The 2015 legislation was complex and this legislation involved the same level of complexity.  Trying to capture what was intended without leaving loopholes which could be exploited and without going beyond what was intended is a tricky operation.<\/p> <p>  It is helpful that the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, will be published and available for consideration by stakeholders in the market over the summer recess.  We will return to it on Report Stage in the autumn and this will give us the opportunity to revisit some of the technical details.  Specifically, we may bring forward Report Stage amendments following engagement with the Central Bank on the appropriate regulatory regime.  That said, the amendments achieve what we and Deputy Michael McGrath have set out to achieve and I look forward to the debate.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question, the main difference between authorisation as a retail credit firm and authorisation as a credit serving firm is that retail credit firms are required to submit details of their credit risk strategy, their credit policy, their credit control policy, forbearance restructuring, etc., provisioning and bad debts policy to the Central Bank.  The bank also imposes a requirement on retail credit firms to communicate with its management body in respect of any deviations from these strategy.  A retail credit firm is also required to ensure that any significant deviations from the credit risk strategy, credit policy, credit control policy and provisioning policy should be communicated to its management body in accordance with the reporting arrangements set out in the credit policy.  The credit servicing firm authorisation requirements require credit firms to have professional indemnity and insurance, to notify the Central Bank in advance of taking on a new loan portfolio, and provide for requirements around a credit firm's relationship with the loan owner.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission has launched a proposal for a European directive on the authorisation of credit servicers.  The proposed directive provides that credit servicers authorised in a member state can provide their service across the EU provided they are in compliance with the directive.  Member states would be required to have an authorisation regime in place for credit servicing firms under the proposed directive.  The proposed directive would require that loan purchasers are not subject to additional requirements.  This is not compatible with the Private Members' Bill.<\/p> <p>  The benefits to regulating firms as credit serving firms include the following - continuing the existing credit servicing regime is of benefit to existing credit servicing firms; it would allow existing credit servicing firms to passport to other EU countries; it is more stable from a legislative viewpoint; it is more likely to be consistent with the new EU regime; and, authorising loan owners as retail credit firms would not improve the consumer protections that would be available to borrowers - there would be the same protections as available via authorisation as a credit servicing firm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#B00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Can I come in on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#B00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I accept there is a lot there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#B00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>There is a lot there.

The three types of regulation in place at this point are regulation of the banks, which is the gold standard; regulation of the retail credit firms, which is a lesser standard; and regulation of the credit servicing firm, which is the weakest standard.  It would not be appropriate to regulate the vulture funds with the least stringent standard.  They are not servicing firms as they hold the loans of Irish consumers.

I have spoken on section 1.  The amendments are aimed at the definitions which will be inserted in section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997.  This section is in the Part of the 1997 Act which deals with the regulated businesses.  The amendments will expand the definition of &quot;credit servicing&quot; and &quot;credit servicing firm&quot; and also allow passive securitisation vehicles to continue to operate without regulation.  These vehicles are completely passive and do not interact with consumers and, therefore, do not give rise to any consumer protection concerns.  Their role in providing funding to the financial sector which can be used to provide credit to the real economy is widely recognised and it was never my intention that these vehicles would be regulated.<\/p><p>Credit servicing has been broken into three components.  The first, holding legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement, is the key element of the Bill.<\/p><p>The second component is the managing or administering of a number of different elements of the credit agreement.  This includes all elements which were previously in the definition of credit servicing and also includes &quot;determining the overall strategy for the strategy and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements&quot; and &quot;maintaining control over key decisions related to the portfolio&quot;.  These are the key elements and these are changes to the definition of the credit servicing firm.  It is essentially what pulls in the loan owner who is making those decisions.  The third component is communicating with the borrower on these elements.  <br\/><br\/>This will capture those activities whose exclusion from the definition of credit servicing meant that owners of credit agreements were not required to be authorised including the now specifically holding of legal title to credit making key decisions and determining strategy means that anyone doing these activities will need authorisation and will, therefore, be regulated by the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the amended definition of a credit servicing firm.  This means that anyone who undertakes credit servicing other than on behalf of a regulated owner and includes people who were taken to be authorised under transitional arrangements.<br\/><br\/>If a person is undertaking credit servicing on behalf of an owner of credit, the credit servicer does not have to be regulated because the owner of the credit is the regulated entity.  This part of the definition is similar to the definition in the 2015 Act.  The amendment will also insert a number of technical definitions to do with ownership and with securitisation.<br\/><br\/>There is a new subsection (2).  This makes it clear that even if there is an owner, that is the holder of legal title, and has credit servicing undertaken by a regulated credit servicing firm, the owner still has to be regulated.  New subsection (2A) specifically excludes securitisation entities from the need to be authorised.  It draws from the definitions used in the most recent securities regulation, Regulation (EU) 2017\/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of technical definitions inserted in the Bill on foot of this exclusion, &quot;owner of credit&quot;, &quot;retain on an ongoing basis&quot;, &quot;securitisations special purpose entity&quot; and also others which are given the same meaning as in the regulation.<br\/><br\/>It was always the intention that securitisation vehicles which were not actively involved in dealing with consumers would not require regulation by the Central Bank.  We sought to provide for that in the original Bill.  An amendment has now been brought forward, with the assistance of the Department of Finance.  This technical amendment excludes securitisation from the definition of credit servicing.<br\/><br\/>New subsection (4) makes it clear that a person who is currently authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm is taken to be authorised under the 2018 legislation without having to seek further authorisation.  It is difficult to see why we would need to have additional authorisation requirements for existing firms which are already authorised and regulated.<br\/><br\/>If additional requirements are needed, it should be noted that section 33A of the Central Bank Act 1997 provides that the bank, in dealing with a regulated business, may among other things:<\/p><blockquote>( a) make the firm&rsquo;s authorisation subject to such conditions or requirements, or both, as it considers appropriate, relating to&mdash; (i) the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of retail credit firms or authorised home reversion firms, and <br \/><br \/>(ii) the protection of their customers or potential customers; <\/blockquote><p>Acceptance of this amendment will involve the deletion of section 2 currently in the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#E00500","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The issues in sections 2 and 3 return to the core point of who should be regulated or not, should it be the credit servicing firm or the retail credit firm.  My view is that it should be the retail credit firm, therefore, this would also need to change.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise two points on the new section 2.  I am concerned about the issue of not regulating the credit servicing firm, if the owner of the loans is regulated, because that will become the norm.  Under this legislation, we would regulate the owners with the lightest type of regulation which is the credit servicing firm regulation.  Therefore, the servicing firms that the people deal with and interact with will not be regulated.  The argument for that approach is that the owner is regulated so that they can be pursued.  I am unsure if that is the best approach.  It goes back to the original point of whether we should leave the credit services unregulated under the existing legislation and the owner should be regulated as a retail credit firm, which would resolve this issue and ensure that those who are interacting with individuals, sending out letters in some cases, not responding and so on, cannot take a gloves-off approach because they themselves are not under the scope of the Central Bank as an entity while the fund which contracted their services would be and could be held accountable for their role.  In this scenario, it would be better that both would be regulated.  The new subsection (2) makes it clear that can happen where there is a credit servicing firm that is regulated, and the owner is regulated, that both can coexist but it also allows for them not to coexist, and for one not to be regulated.  I am concerned about that and would like to revisit it on Report Stage.  I say Report Stage because the whole issue of whether it should be a retail credit firm goes to the core of how we approach this legislation.  I would like to hear the Central Bank's view on that.  <\/p> <p>  My second point relates to securitisation.  I am sure that this is not the case, however, where the holder of credit, that is, the vulture fund, secures a part of that debt through the process of securitisation, the vehicle that would be established would not come under the regulation of this Bill.  Is it the case that the owner of the debt would still be regulated?  If a vulture fund secured 15% of the debt through securitisation that would not exempt it from regulation under this legislation.  I refer to section 3 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#F00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's last question, the holder is the regulated entity.

The agents and vulture funds inflict terrible pain and suffering on families all over the country but do what they like.  The purpose of the Bill and similar Bills is to provide an appropriate level of consumer protection, which is necessary because these companies will not submit to accountability and transparency before the committee.  I understand the point made by Deputy McGrath that this is getting into the nitty-gritty of regulation but it is necessary in order to protect the consumer.  I ask the Minister of State to consider what has happened in this country in recent years and the disregard shown by those companies for the Oireachtas.
