We cannot stop that.  However, I was concerned about the headline.  It has to be clarified for the public.  I am not saying the headline is misleading but it can be interpreted in a number of ways.  It comes from a briefing note for the Committee of Public Accounts so we have a responsibility to clarify it.  The headline is &quot;Cut-off for cancer payouts imposed&quot; and it continues that the Committee of Public Accounts is to grill the State Claims Agency on the growing scale of the crisis.  The article goes on to discuss the 40 cases which are before the courts.  Further down it refers to the separate payment, the expenses, being given to these women.  That was set up by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and covers approximately 2,500.  The Taoiseach commented yesterday that there will be a cut-off for those payments.  It is important for people to note that the cut-off in the headline is not referring to the court proceedings or any proceedings that might arise from court proceedings or the work of the State Claims Agency.  That distinction must be made because that could be inferred from the headline.  Given that it came from a committee briefing note - which it should not have but a member of the committee gave it to the reporter - that needs to be clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#B03000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Okay, that is fair comment.  As Chairman, every Wednesday I receive a telephone call to confirm what the committee will discuss in the Thursday meeting and various journalists are able to read for me verbatim from the information circulated to committee members, some of which I have not even had an opportunity to read at that stage.  There is a serial leaker in the committee, full stop.  I do not know who it is and I am not suggesting who it is, but there is one.  There has not yet been a week that a journalist did not telephone me to read out correspondence that had not yet come before the committee.  It is remarkable.  Yesterday, another committee launched reports and I asked the various chairmen how they dealt with their reports and draft reports.

That was his right but he basically kept coming back to the report which vindicated that the issue never happened and that the word \"boycott\" was never used and so on.  He would not answer a question about that when it was put to him.

Only &euro;3.4 million was outstanding at the end of 2017.  We note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1473 is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 5 July 2018 outlining the process involved in the review of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and also providing a copy of the review.  That review is too large to get into today.  We will consider the issue of how the State is dealing with protected disclosure.  The report is there.  I have looked at it.  It is lovely in that if one reads it, one would almost think it was working well.  I felt the report was missing testimonials from people who made protected disclosures.  They seemed to have consulted with stakeholders but there is an absence of testimonials from the people who made the disclosures.<\/p> <p>  We will return to this issue in the autumn.  We asked for one specific issue in our correspondence, namely, a list of people who made submissions.  Chapter 5 of the review deals with the submissions.  It gives an overview, the thematic issues raised and a consideration of those points.  However, our first question was about who made submissions.  That would normally be published.  When someone makes a submission to a public body, the advertisement will say that the submission will be put on the website.  I am shocked that we have not been given the names of that.  We requested it at the previous meeting when protected disclosures arose.  We had a letter telling us that this was under way.  We were shocked to know it was under way as we did not seem to know about it.  They say that Oireachtas Members were notified on the matter by email on 25 August 2017, and that there were advertisements in the newspaper in August 2017 and that the closing date for submission was 10 October.  The submissions might be on their website.  <\/p> <p>  Apart from discussion on this, I propose that we invite Transparency International Ireland, which sent us a report on this, before the committee, primarily because the Department's review relies heavily on Transparency International Ireland's own report.  The Department's report includes several charts illustrating the finance of the survey which are reproduced with the permission of Transparency International Ireland.  Since its report has had a significant input into that of the Department, it is important that we hear from it.  We will have to organise the sequencing of the witnesses.  It looks as though Transparency International Ireland got closer to the bone of the issue than the Department.  Is it agreed that we include it?  It would be in the autumn work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#E01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I wish to agree with the Chairman on stakeholders.

I see controversial planning applications being submitted on the August bank holiday weekend and other stuff tied to the recess.

We agreed at our meeting on 28 June to request a recently published report on this matter from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  That committee has made a number of supportive recommendations.  I propose that we write to the committee to keep us updated on the matter and for it to follow through on the recommendations.  I propose we write to the individual to say that the Committee of Public Accounts cannot take up the matter separately given that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has produced a detailed report on the matter.  Extensive documentation was supplied to that committee in preparing its very comprehensive report.  Obviously, it would not be appropriate due to Oireachtas time to duplicate the work it has already done.  We fully support that committee in its work.  As the sectoral committee, it is best placed to deal with this matter at the moment.<\/p><p>Correspondence No. 1350, which was held over, was received from an individual regarding a submission to the committee on the management of protected disclosures.

The secretariat will make the necessary arrangements for a meeting following the recess.

It replied that it had none.  That is in private correspondence to me.  I propose that we formally write to the CRU, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in Ireland, which was formerly the Commission for Energy Regulation, with that report asking for a detailed observation on the report and its views on any role or function it has regarding that electricity substation in County Laois.  As the regulator, the CRU may have a role as it approves funding for capital projects, how much of those capital costs can be passed on to the customer and the financing of it.

As members are aware, the NTMA is a complex organisation with multiple functions that extend beyond its original and core role in managing Ireland&rsquo;s national debt.  The structure of the NTMA, following a reorganisation in 2014, is outlined in the written submission.  The sets of financial statements before the committee this morning reflect the various statutory obligations that the NTMA has in respect of its financial reporting.<\/p> <p>  The NTMA&rsquo;s primary function is to manage borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the national debt account.  At the end of 2017, the gross national debt stood at just under &euro;199 billion, marginally lower than the debt at the end of 2016.  Total debt servicing costs in 2017 amounted to &euro;6.2 billion.  This was 9% less than in the previous year, reflecting the impact of refinancing of debt at prevailing low interest rates.<\/p> <p>  Other important functions and services of the NTMA include: management of compensation claims on behalf of certain State authorities, in its capacity as the State Claims Agency; the management of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF; and the provision of procurement and financial advice in respect of certain public private partnerships and other large capital projects in its capacity as the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.<\/p> <p>  In mid-2017, &euro;3.45 billion was realised from the sale of almost 29% of the shares in AIB held by the ISIF.  The proceeds from the sale were transferred from the fund to the Exchequer in the year.  The value of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholding in AIB at end 2017 was estimated at &euro;10.5 billion.<\/p> <p>  The NTMA assigns staff and provides certain other support services, on a reimbursement basis, to two independent bodies - the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  These are governed by separate boards, and the NTMA is not accountable for their activities.  The NTMA also provides staff on secondment for the Department of Finance&rsquo;s banking unit, with the costs in that case being carried by the NTMA.  The NTMA&rsquo;s administration account shows gross expenditure on administration costs totalled &euro;116.4 million in 2017, with 80% of the expenditure in respect of staff costs.<\/p> <p>  The audit report on the account draws attention to expenditure of &euro;6.2 million in 2017 relating to contracts that were not publicly advertised.  The NTMA&rsquo;s statement on internal control provides explanations for the procurement approach adopted in relation to those contracts.  The audit report also draws attention to non-effective expenditure of &euro;853,000 relating to the planned development of a treasury management IT system.  The project was terminated by the NTMA in 2017 without completion of the planned system.<\/p> <p>  Section 12 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 requires me to report annually to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with respect to the correctness of the sums brought to account by the NTMA.  This is in addition to the audit certificates that in produce on each set of financial statements.  Chapter 23 before the committee today is the report in respect of 2016 and it highlights key developments in the year.<\/p><p>A similar report is being prepared for 2017 and will form part of the report on the accounts for the public services in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. O'Kelly to make his opening statement.

I understand.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation.  With me are Mr. Ian Black, our chief operating officer and chief financial officer, and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen who the committee has got to know probably more than any of us had hoped as director of the State Claims Agency.  I was not planning on reading my opening statement.  I have supplied slides for reference.  Their purpose is to illustrate some of the themes which inform our strategy and policy on the marketplace.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on a number of the businesses, starting with the primary original business, as the Comptroller and Auditor General described it, of managing the national debt.  A theme at which we are looking is how late it is in the investment cycle and the changing interest rate cycle and environment.  We see this in a number of ways, although the most obvious is the announcement of the withdrawal and ending of the quantitative easing programme and what that might do.  The interest rate environment has been supportive and tranquil and had no surprises.  That is the environment in which we have been for seven or eight years.  It is supportive in that central banks have been buying bonds for quantitative easing in the European Central Bank's case; tranquil in that \"lower for longer\" has been the mantra for central banks with regard to interest rates; while \"no surprises\" means that the forward guidance central banks have given us on interest rates has been quite specific.  It is our view that all three of these pillars of policy to which we have got used in the past seven or eight years are likely to change.  As we will have the withdrawal of quantitative easing, it will not be as supportive, while rates will not be lower for longer.  The Federal Reserve System has already raised rates seven times in its changing interest rate cycle and it is likely that the ECB will start to change its approach to interest rates, even though it has issued statements stating it will continue to keep rates low well into 2019.  However, the environment is likely to change.  That means that we will have to be careful and cautious heading into the future, particularly since Ireland is still very indebted, as we regularly point out in our bulletins and discussions with investors.  Investors remain concerned about Ireland's very high levels of debt.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio has traditionally been the metric used and it has moved in a more favourable direction, but investors are less interested in that metric these days because of the obvious difficulties we have had in Ireland with GDP as to whether it is an accurate measure of our ability to repay our debts.  Investors look more at interest as a percentage of Government revenue and at total debt as a percentage of Government revenue.  Ireland does not fare quite as well on these metrics as we do on others.  We are still quite high up the league tables.  I provided a chart to demonstrate this.<\/p> <p>  There are concerns about the indebtedness of the country, despite the interest rate environment.  The interest rate environment has meant that our interest bill, as the Comptroller and Auditor General says in his report on our accounts, was &euro;6.2 billion in 2017, down from &euro;7.5 billion at its highest.  We think it is on its way towards &euro;5 billion, notwithstanding the fact that the interest rate environment will change.  The reason we have a high degree of confidence that the interest bill will continue to fall, despite the changing interest rate environment, is we have pre-emptively locked in interest rates by building up a significant amount of cash, repaying the International Monetary Fund and taking a number of other actions in buying back higher coupon bonds and locking in today's lower rates.  We have been able to buy insurance for taxpayers because of this pre-emptive action to lock the interest bill into today's interest rate environment before it begins to turn.  We can be confident that that will occur because between now and 2020 we will have a lot of debt maturing, much of which is high coupon debt.  The averages of the maturing coupons are between 4.5% and 5.9% which we are replacing at today's rates or the rates in the past 12 to 18 months.  That differential is being locked in.  What happened this morning is a good example.  As committee members have been sitting here, an auction has been taking place in the market in which Ireland has issued &euro;1.25 billion, a ten-year note at a yield of approximately 0.81% to 0.82%, or just below 1%, and a 30-year bond at a rate closer to 1.6%.  We are locking in that differential as these coupons mature.  That means that we will produce some savings in the near term.  That is what one would expect the National Treasury Management Agency to be doing in this environment and what quantitative easing is all about.  It allows more indebted countries to make interest rate savings.  We have been able to do this to some degree to buy some insurance, but it does not mean that the environment will not change.<\/p> <p>  A good example might be what recently happened with Italy, which is a reminder of how quickly things can change and spreads can move.  The Italian ten-year spread moved by 100 basis points, or 1%, over a three month period, as there began to be uncertainty about Italy's future policies and concerns about instability of the Government there.  If Ireland's credit spread was 100 basis points wider, since we have issued &euro;50 billion since the beginning of 2015, having borrowed &euro;50 billion in the marketplace-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Since when?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#L00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Since the beginning of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Therefore, in three and a half years, we have refinanced &euro;50 billion of our debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#L00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>That is only about one quarter of our debt.

It is a fund of &euro;8.9 billion.  It has what we call a dual or double bottom line mandate.  It is charged with investing in Ireland only and its investments must produce a commercial return and a beneficial economic impact for the country.  That is what we describe as a double bottom line.  The fund has invested &euro;3.8 billion across the economy since its inception at the beginning of 2015, across all sectors and regions.<\/p><p>Just under 50% is invested outside of Dublin.  The returns so far on the fund have been reasonable.  The annual return to date is 2.3%.  The return last year, the year in question, was 4.3%.  If we take the 2.3% annually, that has added &euro;648 million to the size of the fund just because of the investment return.  It has been a positive environment for the fund in that regard and it has been possible to add to the size of the fund through those returns.<\/p><p> One of the positive surprises for us in respect of the fund was the attraction of private capital.  It was always envisaged that the ISIF would be a minority investor and would look to attract private capital to invest alongside it, or that it would invest alongside private capital.  We thought originally that maybe for every &euro;1 million the ISIF invested, it would attract &euro;1 million from the private sector; that was the metric we were using in the initial studies.  It has turned out that the multiple of investment and crowding in of private investment has been higher than that and is running at 1.7 times.  This means the &euro;3.8 billion of investment by the ISIF has resulted in &euro;10.4 billion being invested in the Irish economy when we include the attraction of private capital.  That is a very significant sum and a good bit higher than we originally envisaged.<\/p><p> The ISIF has a global portfolio.  The &euro;8.9 billion sits there and the bit that is not yet invested in the Irish economy is invested in the stock market and some conservative investments to wait for it to be drawn down, as it were, as the commitments come near.  That portfolio sits in a variety of market vehicles that are reasonably conservative.  It is managed actively by the team also.<\/p><p> In deference to Deputy Catherine Connolly, this time last year we had a discussion about responsible investing and I think it is fair to say that after that discussion we accelerated changes to our policy on responsible investing.  Legislatively, we were only excluded from purchasing munitions stocks in the original legislation.  We have expanded that policy to include the banning of tobacco stocks and have recently also included a list of the dirtier fossil fuel companies.  Almost 16 stocks are now excluded from the portfolio.  In accordance with what is really current best practice globally, we are still potentially investing in some older fuel companies provided they are making a transition to renewable and provided they have a proven decarbonisation strategy.  They still attract investment from funds like ours.  Those that are not are increasingly being excluded by the market and we have taken some steps to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>If Mr. O'Kelly and the members will indulge me for one moment, the last time he was before the committee was in 2016, I think.  At that stage I raised the issue of investment in tobacco and issued a strong press release asking the NTMA to divest itself of its investments in that area.  I commenced working on a Private Members' Bill that autumn, which was introduced in the D&aacute;il, namely, the Ethical Public Investment (Tobacco) Bill 2017, a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit the investment of public moneys directly or indirectly in equities or debt securities issued by tobacco companies.  Around that time - maybe it was a pure coincidence although I like to think it was more than that - the Minister announced that he was going to introduce similar provisions.  I was very pleased to see that result.  It was an issue that got well aired when the NTMA was before the Committee of Public Accounts in 2016 and within six months it had divested itself of the tobacco investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#M00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Absolutely, and in fairness to the Chairman and the committee in general the point is that the fund should be mirroring what Members of the Oireachtas want or the actions they believe citizens want them to take.

Obviously the fossil fuels Bill is going through the Houses as we speak and we have been working closely with the various committees on that.<\/p> <p>  To touch on the National Development Finance Agency, it is involved in direct procurement, public private partnerships, PPPs, and advising Departments in terms of financial value for money.  The PPP that people are probably most conscious of at the moment is what we call \"schools bundle 5\", which has been affected by the Carillion collapse.  That has been an extraordinary story for the UK with huge implications for jobs and a vast number of projects right across different sectors.  Thankfully, in Ireland Carillion was only involved in one PPP in addition to a number of other smaller projects.  The collapse did indeed cause very significant difficulties and complications for that PPP project.  Ultimately, a number of the schools are likely to be completed, three of them hopefully by this school term, which was in doubt at various stages.  Hopefully that looks likely to happen, which is a positive.  The other schools will be delayed but works will start in the next couple of quarters.<\/p> <p>  As to what happened, what it means and what the lessons are, I think probably there are two things to take away.  The first concerns the bundling of different projects to make a scale project suitable for a PPP.  In PPPs generally, private capital wants a scale project.  For example, we have bundled 14 primary care centres in a group, and we have also put a group of courthouses together to attract capital.  Smaller projects will not attract that kind of capital, so we have bundled some.  However, unbundling in the event of a failure of one of the counterparties proved to be very difficult.  It has been managed, maybe just in time, but I think we will have to look at contracts involving bundled projects to ensure we have a better mechanism to separate them in the event of one of the counterparties failing.<\/p> <p>  The second consequence is potentially higher pricing in PPPs and procurement in general.  There are still inquiries and lot of new reports coming out of the UK which we are watching closely.  However, from the surface analysis, it seems that Carillion was serially underpricing contracts and the margin was too tight, which ultimately got it into trouble.  There may be a recalibration in public procurement contracts of the price versus the strength of the counterparty and its ability to get the project done at the end of the day.  I suspect that stronger counterparties and stronger balance sheets will prevail and will have an advantage.  That may or may not be right.  Ultimately, they will charge a price for their counterparty strength, which could mean prices rising in both direct and PPPs.  That already seems to be happening in the UK.<\/p> <p>  The UK seems to have a specific exposure in aggregate to Carillion as a counterparty and that appears to be a big issue over there.  I am wondering if Ireland has such an aggregated counterparty list.  Should we have one?  Are there companies to which the sovereign has a total counterparty risk - companies that are doing projects here, there and everywhere?  Is there an aggregate list showing the top ten counterparties with which the sovereign currently has contracts?  Should there be a limit on the State's exposure to any one counterparty rather than another?  I think that is proven in retrospect in the UK, which would probably say it was too exposed, as a state, to one single counterparty.  That is something we might take a look at and take forward proactively.<\/p><p>The other business that the NTMA is in charge of is NewERA, which is a corporate finance advisory business to commercial semi-State companies, and it produces its annual report which is about governance and shareholder value and having all of the State's shareholding in one place with the same metrics, governance structures, reporting and key performance indications, KPIs.  I suppose a measure of confidence in the work that NewERA is doing is that it is getting a lot of additions to its portfolio and being asked to provide additional advice for various Departments.  Recently all of the transport assets of the State were added to NewERA's portfolio as designated bodies and An Post has also been added.  I can see NewERA developing as essentially a custodian - a single place where all of the State's assets and exposures are held in one place, analysed and subject to governance on behalf of the various Departments.  That seems to be growing.<\/p><p> The Committee of Public Accounts is all too familiar with the business of the SCA.  I am sure members will have questions for Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen on the update.  It is a big business now.  It manages claims for 150 different agencies, and is dealing currently with 10,000 claims, 80% of which are non-clinical.  The total contingent liability is substantial, somewhere between &euro;2.5 billion and &euro;3 billion.  It is a significant business.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are asking the agency, through the mandate it has given to us to walk that delicate line between watching out for taxpayer's money and being sensitive to the difficult and tragic circumstances that victims often find themselves in.  It is a difficult balance and the staff of the agency walk it every day.  It is a difficult mandate for somebody.<\/p><p> That covers my statement and I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The first speaker will be Deputy Catherine Murphy, to be followed by Deputy Catherine Connolly and then either Deputies David Cullinane or Jonathan O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#N00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Good morning, gentlemen.

In the particular case, the hospital will carry out its own independent investigation when we provide it with information that would appear to indicate there is a very definite cluster associated with the particular practitioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#N02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I want to move through some of the other areas, specifically, the National Development Finance Agency and Carillion.  Carillion did not engage in building work but essentially contracted out the work.  The opening statement refers to the transfer of risk, which is the purpose of public private partnerships.  According to the agency, PPPs have been very effective and the risk has been transferred to the private sector.  There have been many casualties in the case of Carillion, including the loss of 200 jobs and the impact on small suppliers and subcontractors.  The risk has been transferred but, by and large, it has been carried by domestic suppliers and contractors and the fallout has been significant.  School projects have been delayed.  I am acutely aware of a project in my constituency where other accommodation had to be hired on an interim basis.  There is a knock-on effect on the provision of subjects on the syllabus because of the lack of laboratory or other facilities.  The cost is, therefore, much greater than only the financial cost.<\/p> <p>  There was a red flag over Carillion to begin with.  Does the NTMA take into account such warnings when projects are being considered?  I understand the need for economies of scale but that would be of value irrespective of whether it the project was undertaken by a public private partnership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#O00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I do not for a moment dispute that.  In our commentary we talk about PPPs and risk transfer.  It is quite an academic point about the cost.  I appreciate that the cost is very significant.  The collapse of Carillion is a travesty and a very significant event and the knock-on effects for Sammon and others have been very difficult.  Sammon went into examinership and ultimately liquidation and there are lots of consequences of that.  The Department of Education and Skills was procuring directly with Sammon in lots of different ways so the collapse of Carillion has caused very significant damage.  I am not underestimating that in any sense.  I am just saying the financial structure of the PPP has meant that the schools were built by Carillion and Sammon.  They were paid and the equity providers into that vehicle have lost 90% of the value of the money and the State has not yet paid any monthly payments.  We do not pay until the school opens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I understand that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#O00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>From that point of view, the State would normally have paid out all the &euro;90 million to build the schools to date and would still have all the problems that are there.  In that particular element - the schools that are built to date - here is no financial obligation on the State for the schools that are built to date, and that risk has been borne, appropriately, because that is what the PPP is supposed to have done.  Some of the questions in the past have been about risk transfer and whether a PPP really transfers risk and if the State is not on the hook anyway and how the State always has to pay for everything at the end of the day.  This demonstrates for that particular piece that that is not the case.  The risk has been borne by the PPP funders and the risk has not transferred back to the State.  It has been owned by funders.  They have lost the money and they are currently under value or under water on their equity and that is the way PPPs are set up.  That does not mean we do not have to solve these other problems about the schools opening, but one would have to do that whether the construction was direct or indirect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The fallout has predominantly been domestic in terms of the liquidation of Sammon and the impact on subcontractors and jobs.

Companies go out of business and they succeed and they fail and that happens in the construction business which is a particularly volatile business.  It does not matter how one is building; nobody can predict the future and nobody has a crystal ball.  The question is whether one has a mechanism set up which, in the event of something like that happening, allows one to get around it and have enough flexibility.  When the contract was originally put out Carillion was a very robust publicly quoted company which had the confidence of shareholders and investors all over the world.  In our counterparty analysis, it looked like a fine company at that point.  By the way, it was a fine company at that point.  In designing the contract with what is a good counterparty at that point, we build into the mechanism that, in the event of one of the parties failing, which happened in the case of Carillion, the other members of PPPCo can take over the running of the PPPCo and then start to instruct and make sure the schools get built.

It refers to the divestment of all global exposures and the focus on a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable economy with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  While I am all for that, are we not at risk of putting all our eggs in one basket again?  If we are divesting all into Ireland and if something extraordinary happened, are we not, yet again, exposing the people of Ireland to another crash?

One is a follow-up to that of Deputy O'Brien, whose questioning was very revealing.  Deputy O'Connell and I are on the health committee and the Committee of Public Accounts and we have gone through this intricately for months.  I have probably attended eight to ten committee meetings on the subject.  I have probably been at every committee meeting, between everything, yet it is a drip-feed.  I am seriously worried, now that the Houses of the Oireachtas are about to go into recess, that the greatest form of transparency emerging in this actually transpires in these rooms.  The Houses are to be closed for the next couple of months.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what Deputy O'Brien teased out, I do not want to wrong Mr. Breen; he did give figures before.  Maybe we could have gone further in the way we teased it out so I do not want to wrong Mr. Breen.  I must ask him, however, on having taken down his figures, whether he can break down the categories of claims of the 12, four and one, or 17 cases, in other words.  We know we have 221 cases and that there are 17 in the \"others\" category.  It would be revealing, informative and educational to know what types of cases the 17 cases are.<\/p><p>We know of one because in fairness, Deputy O'Brien has raised it on a number of occasions.  What are they?  I am meeting the Minister for Health later on today and I would like to know whether these 17 cases are part of the Scally review.  I doubt he even knows.  I am sure some of his people are watching this.  I would like to be able to ask.  Is there any way Mr. Breen can break that down for us today?  If not, I would be surprised because I think he should be able to do so.  <\/p><p> If one teases it out, this case is pre-Vicky Phelan.  If Vicky Phelan had not come out and blown the lid off all of this, what would have happened?  Are there issues here relating to non-disclosure preceding Vicky Phelan that we do not know about?  Why were we not aware of cases like this?  Are there issues relating to the laboratories that are involved in these 17 cases that are outside the 221 cases that we need to know about?  <\/p><p> The third question is a catchall.  Mr. Breen has been before us a number of times.  On occasion, through our own fault, we might not have probed things to the level they should have been probed.  I think we often do but perhaps we do not.  I say this with the greatest will in the world and am putting this out there because of what the Chairman said.  Is there anything Mr. Breen needs to tell us or members of the public who are watching about this issue; is there anything we need to know?  There are three parts to the first question.  I have two more questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#X05300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I will deal with them in the order in which they were asked.

I have been contacted by the solicitor of a family of one of the women who, unfortunately, passed away and who was one of the group of 221 women.  I am sorry to have to read this off my phone but I did not get a chance to print it out because I came in here straightaway.  They submitted an FOI request to the NTMA, which was really to the State Claims Agency, for the immediate release of all documents of any nature held by the State Claims Agency, its servants and agents regarding the late Ms X - obviously, I will not say the name.  The request was refused.  I might remind Mr. Breen what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il regarding non-co-operation and I hope there are civil servants watching this who will relay it back to the Taoiseach wherever he is in Ireland or the world.  How in the name of God when the family of one of the women who, unfortunately, passed away because of this scandal, looks for all their information from a State agency, which is handling the claims, can that agency say it will not give over the information it has on that woman but still say it is co-operating fully with all family requests and all requests for information?<\/p><p>I am shocked by this.  That is why I raised concerns earlier regarding getting transparency when the D&aacute;il and the committees are closed down for the summer.  It is beyond my comprehension how the head of freedom of information in the NTMA, through the State Claims Agency, can turn down this request for documents from the family of a woman who is deceased as a result of this scandal.<\/p><p> Mr. Breen and his colleagues may hide behind FOI legislation, etc.  That is find but I imagine that, somewhere along the line, a person went up the line - through the NTMA and all the way to the Department - and said that the organisation had a moral duty to supply this information.  I am sure Mr. Breen will tell me he did that.  I am sure he will not tell me that he hid behind the fact that, possibly, under a technicality relating to the provisions of the FOI legislation, the agency does not have to give out the information.<\/p><p> That would run counter to everything the Taoiseach told Mr. Breen and everyone else involved to do.  It would also run counter to the fact that we have the State Claims Agency saying that all cases will be mediated and dealt with as quickly as possible and in the best way the organisation can manage.  I take Mr. Breen at his word on that.  To be fair, when he is before the committee, he provides good information, although sometimes we have to ask the questions.  In any event, not giving out this information runs counter to all of that.  It runs counter to the morality of the situation in the sense that these people are entitled to it.  The entire country is watching.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have said that all this information should be provided and that there will be a serious problem for anyone who does not co-operate.

When it comes to investments and working with State bodies, does the NTMA believe that such bodies actually put forward projects in which the agency could and should invest?  I understand and appreciate that the terms of reference of the agency are defined.  Indeed, I acknowledge it.  Perhaps they are a little too rigid but the agency has to work within its position.  I have no issue with that.  In any event, are projects ever put forward in respect of which the NTMA takes the view that it would be good to invest in them but where the State bodies involved effectively do not co-operate or put forward the projects in a way that would make it possible for ISIF to invest?  Have there ever been such cases?  I am not asking Mr. O'Kelly to outline the cases.  Has there ever been a situation whereby projects have been put forward by State bodies but where ISIF was not in a position to invest purely because the bodies involved have not put forward those projects in way that is accessible in the context of how ISIF invests?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#Z01300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":784,"content":"<p>No, I do not think so.

On 27 September, we will hear from the former clinical director of CervicalCheck, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly.  Obviously, members might be back for an update on 27 September.

That is on page 7 of the accounts.  I thank Mr. O'Kelly for the extra briefing information supplied.  Essentially, we have one big problem when one looks at the chart on page 12 of the accounts where it is indicated that the percentage of our debt to GNP is quite low, at 68%, which is moving towards the EU fiscal rules target of 60%.  However, everybody knows - and we have discussed it with the Department of Finance - that this is not a real measure of what happens in Ireland at all because it is totally distorted by the presence of multinationals.  It is not really income to the country.  We have moved on to gross national income, GNI, and now we have GNI*, which Mr. O'Kelly referenced.  The gross Government debt to GNI* ratio is probably a far better indication in reality.  Mr. McCarthy mentions that in the document and he shows that chart.

I am  moving on to the State Claims Agency legal costs on page 41.  I have often raised this before.  This is the \"good public relations\" that is done.  On legal costs, \"in 2017, the SCA settled 440 bills of costs received from third parties for &euro;55.2 million - a reduction of 48% on the &euro;106.9 million claimed\".  One would be forgiven for thinking that great work had been done in reducing the payments on legal fees but when we turn over the page we see that is an artificial figure being compared.  It is comparable to saying someone sent in a bill but I did not pay it and so saved money.  We will  look at the details on page 44 of what actually happened beyond that headline.<\/p> <p>  I am looking on page 44 where the cost of claims resolved from 2013 to 2017 are detailed on a chart.  I refer to the average cost per claim.  The clinical claims are dealt with first.  I am referring to the legal fees for the State Claims Agency and the plaintiff, to the average cost per claim set out in the second column down.  The average cost per claim for the SCA for clinical claims is stated to be &euro;23,000 and the legal fees for the plaintiff were &euro;41,000.  That means that &euro;62,000 on average was paid per claim.  Mr. Breen is reading the same chart.  The award was &euro;130,000.  In other words, legal costs in respect of awards in 2017 were 49% of the legal awards.  For every &euro;100 of settlement to the individual there was an additional 49% in legal costs.  Is that correct?  That is correct.  <\/p> <p>  I will go back to 2004 and I could go back to other years.  In 2004, &euro;48 million was paid out in legal fees on settlements.  A sum of &euro;48,000 was the average legal fee on the average settlement of &euro;93,000, which is 48%.  There has been no real reduction in legal fees.  The SCA's percentage of legal fees, as long as I am sitting here, is running at approximately 50% of the settlements.  If I look at the previous page of the report, it is stated that there was a 48% reduction in legal fees.  Misleading is the most generous word I would put on that.  The SCA has not reduced anything.  These are the SCA's own figures.<\/p> <p>  I will go down then to the general claims, the column below the previous one.  It is the same situation.  I will not read the figures out loud.  I have looked at the money for 2017.  The legal fees paid out were &euro;13.6 million which is 55% of the award of &euro;24.7 million.  That is 55% and that was the rate the previous year and in 2014.  In respect of the payments, and we have been told about the payments increasing, the percentage of the legal fees is fairly static at in or around 50% for years.  Yet the SCA is telling us, and the public would believe it if the details were not looked into, that legal costs have been reduced by 48%.  That is the SCA's big chart on page 41.  It does not gel.  Does Mr. Breen get what I am saying?  That is not a real headline, it is a public relations job.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#QQ01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>No, with respect, those are two different things.  We have a legal costs unit which was established in 2013 within the State Claims Agency.  It handles tribunals' bills of costs arising from third parties appearing before those tribunals.  What we are showing on page 41, and the big figure we are indicating we are saving, are actual bills of costs sent in by third parties that we examined.  In order that the Chair will know, we go out to the solicitor firms.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might comment on this as well.  If it is one of the big firms representing a third party, we go out and we look at all of their boxed files.  We examine them and then we begin to negotiate by saying we are not allowing this, that and so on and that we are reducing them.  It can be seen that we have had really good reductions in the order of more than 40% over the years.

However, as a person from the Department of Finance stated, people in Ireland are the most heavily indebted people in the world, next to Japan, when the State debt and the personal debt are added.  That is nothing to do with the witnesses but to go back to the topic I mentioned earlier, looking at the chart on page 12, which is headed \"FUNDING AND DEBT MANAGEMENT\", the figure for gross Government debt to gross Government revenue, and Mr. O'Kelly signalled this at the outset, is 264.2%.  It is the fourth highest next to Greece, Portugal and Italy.  We are the fourth highest in that category, which he said is a worrying figure.

In the schools sector, I can list two or three companies that seem to build every school in Ireland.  It seems to be a very limited market.  Even Sammon, which was the subcontractor for Carillion, is a major school builder in its own right and it was working on its own projects.  As a result of Carillion going bust, Sammon had to go into liquidation and not just on the sites it was working on for Carillion.  Its liquidation affected myriad other schools.  The pool is too small.  What are Mr. O'Kelly's thoughts on who will look at this?  The National Development Finance Agency should examine the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#VV02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1531382400,"counter":1352,"content":"<p>We will take a lead and we will work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in particular to try to do some sort of an aggregation of exposures and see how we might be able to be a bit more transparent and careful about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018071200002#VV02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor O'Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1531382400,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>We will raise the matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform again in the autumn to make sure somebody works on it.

This is Committee Stage of the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of the Department and the Minister of State.  We have worked closely together to develop these proposals since the Bill passed Second Stage, with a view to reaching broad agreement on the direction of the Bill.  For me and my party, the core objective of this legislation is to ensure that loan ownership becomes a regulated activity, and to change the position which has been in law since 2015, whereby those purchasing loans, whether commercial loans or mortgages, are required to appoint an intermediary who acts as a credit servicing agent or credit servicing firm, and under the 2015 Act, that intermediary has to be a regulated entity.  From my perspective, the loan owner should be directly regulated and accountable to the Central Bank, so that the full suite of powers available to the Central Bank relating to all other regulated entities would apply.  That is the key objective that I have in seeking to advance this legislation.  The litmus test is really whether all of the Central Bank codes apply, such as the consumer protection code, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, and lending to small and medium-sized enterprises regulations, and whether the full suite of powers set out in the 2013 supervision and enforcement legislation applies and is available to the Central Bank so that, if necessary, the Central Bank has the power to inspect, investigate and, if necessary, to take enforcement action.  Those who own the loan and ultimately make all of the important decisions about its future, such as whether a person keeps a home, or about a business or farm, should be directly regulated and accountable to the Central Bank.  The Bill is not a panacea for dealing with all non-performing loan, NPL, issues and arrears, but it is an important and necessary step.<\/p> <p>  Other changes which we have spoken about on many occasions are required.<\/p><p>These include changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That code is being reviewed and my party has proposals in that regard as well.<\/p><p> In recent weeks, since the passage of the Bill on Second Stage, we have worked closely with the Department to essentially rewrite the Bill and put it in a format which can hopefully come through Committee and Remaining Stages and which achieves the core objective of the Bill.<\/p><p> Section 1 is proposed to be deleted.  I have shared with other members our speaking notes on the legislation.<\/p><p> Having considered the matter in more detail and focusing on the objective of ensuring that loan owners are regulated by the Central Bank, I am bringing forward changes to the definitions.  There are advantages to using an existing authorisation regime already in use by the Central Bank rather than creating a new type of regulated entity, the credit agreement owner, as originally proposed.  Therefore, the current definition section is proposed to be deleted and a new set of definitions will be introduced.<\/p><p> There are advantages to using an existing regime.  It means that the Central Bank already has an authorisation process in place and has already set a fitness and probity regime.  Using the credit serving regime that was put in place in 2015 should help Irish regulated firms when the proposed EU directive on credit serving is put in place.<\/p><p> I appreciate the Central Bank recommended that the retail credit firm regime be used and I may wish to return to this on Report Stage.  Members will have read the submission made by the Central Bank to Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach during the scrutiny phase.  The Central Bank came down on the side of opting for the retail credit firm model.  I understand there has been much engagement between the Department and the Central Bank on that point.  The view at present is that availing of the existing framework, in terms of credit serving firm, is the optimum way to go but it is something that we may need to revisit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#A00500","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":1364,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we have reached Committee Stage on Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill.

I am representing the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who is at ECOFIN today.<\/p> <p>  This is an important piece of legislation and we need to be careful that it does not have unintended consequences.  I acknowledge the interaction between the Department, the Central Bank and the members opposite.<\/p> <p>  The Government was committed to supporting the Bill on Second Stage and followed through on the commitment.  I acknowledge the support of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in developing the amendments proposed.  The 2015 legislation was complex and this legislation involved the same level of complexity.  Trying to capture what was intended without leaving loopholes which could be exploited and without going beyond what was intended is a tricky operation.<\/p> <p>  It is helpful that the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, will be published and available for consideration by stakeholders in the market over the summer recess.  We will return to it on Report Stage in the autumn and this will give us the opportunity to revisit some of the technical details.  Specifically, we may bring forward Report Stage amendments following engagement with the Central Bank on the appropriate regulatory regime.  That said, the amendments achieve what we and Deputy Michael McGrath have set out to achieve and I look forward to the debate.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question, the main difference between authorisation as a retail credit firm and authorisation as a credit serving firm is that retail credit firms are required to submit details of their credit risk strategy, their credit policy, their credit control policy, forbearance restructuring, etc., provisioning and bad debts policy to the Central Bank.  The bank also imposes a requirement on retail credit firms to communicate with its management body in respect of any deviations from these strategy.  A retail credit firm is also required to ensure that any significant deviations from the credit risk strategy, credit policy, credit control policy and provisioning policy should be communicated to its management body in accordance with the reporting arrangements set out in the credit policy.  The credit servicing firm authorisation requirements require credit firms to have professional indemnity and insurance, to notify the Central Bank in advance of taking on a new loan portfolio, and provide for requirements around a credit firm's relationship with the loan owner.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission has launched a proposal for a European directive on the authorisation of credit servicers.  The proposed directive provides that credit servicers authorised in a member state can provide their service across the EU provided they are in compliance with the directive.  Member states would be required to have an authorisation regime in place for credit servicing firms under the proposed directive.  The proposed directive would require that loan purchasers are not subject to additional requirements.  This is not compatible with the Private Members' Bill.<\/p> <p>  The benefits to regulating firms as credit serving firms include the following - continuing the existing credit servicing regime is of benefit to existing credit servicing firms; it would allow existing credit servicing firms to passport to other EU countries; it is more stable from a legislative viewpoint; it is more likely to be consistent with the new EU regime; and, authorising loan owners as retail credit firms would not improve the consumer protections that would be available to borrowers - there would be the same protections as available via authorisation as a credit servicing firm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#B00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":1366,"content":"<p>Can I come in on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#B00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":1367,"content":"<p>I accept there is a lot there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#B00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":1368,"content":"<p>There is a lot there.

I have spoken on section 1.  The amendments are aimed at the definitions which will be inserted in section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997.  This section is in the Part of the 1997 Act which deals with the regulated businesses.  The amendments will expand the definition of &quot;credit servicing&quot; and &quot;credit servicing firm&quot; and also allow passive securitisation vehicles to continue to operate without regulation.  These vehicles are completely passive and do not interact with consumers and, therefore, do not give rise to any consumer protection concerns.  Their role in providing funding to the financial sector which can be used to provide credit to the real economy is widely recognised and it was never my intention that these vehicles would be regulated.<\/p><p>Credit servicing has been broken into three components.  The first, holding legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement, is the key element of the Bill.<\/p><p>The second component is the managing or administering of a number of different elements of the credit agreement.  This includes all elements which were previously in the definition of credit servicing and also includes &quot;determining the overall strategy for the strategy and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements&quot; and &quot;maintaining control over key decisions related to the portfolio&quot;.  These are the key elements and these are changes to the definition of the credit servicing firm.  It is essentially what pulls in the loan owner who is making those decisions.  The third component is communicating with the borrower on these elements.  <br\/><br\/>This will capture those activities whose exclusion from the definition of credit servicing meant that owners of credit agreements were not required to be authorised including the now specifically holding of legal title to credit making key decisions and determining strategy means that anyone doing these activities will need authorisation and will, therefore, be regulated by the Central Bank.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the amended definition of a credit servicing firm.  This means that anyone who undertakes credit servicing other than on behalf of a regulated owner and includes people who were taken to be authorised under transitional arrangements.<br\/><br\/>If a person is undertaking credit servicing on behalf of an owner of credit, the credit servicer does not have to be regulated because the owner of the credit is the regulated entity.  This part of the definition is similar to the definition in the 2015 Act.  The amendment will also insert a number of technical definitions to do with ownership and with securitisation.<br\/><br\/>There is a new subsection (2).  This makes it clear that even if there is an owner, that is the holder of legal title, and has credit servicing undertaken by a regulated credit servicing firm, the owner still has to be regulated.  New subsection (2A) specifically excludes securitisation entities from the need to be authorised.  It draws from the definitions used in the most recent securities regulation, Regulation (EU) 2017\/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of technical definitions inserted in the Bill on foot of this exclusion, &quot;owner of credit&quot;, &quot;retain on an ongoing basis&quot;, &quot;securitisations special purpose entity&quot; and also others which are given the same meaning as in the regulation.<br\/><br\/>It was always the intention that securitisation vehicles which were not actively involved in dealing with consumers would not require regulation by the Central Bank.  We sought to provide for that in the original Bill.  An amendment has now been brought forward, with the assistance of the Department of Finance.  This technical amendment excludes securitisation from the definition of credit servicing.<br\/><br\/>New subsection (4) makes it clear that a person who is currently authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm is taken to be authorised under the 2018 legislation without having to seek further authorisation.  It is difficult to see why we would need to have additional authorisation requirements for existing firms which are already authorised and regulated.<br\/><br\/>If additional requirements are needed, it should be noted that section 33A of the Central Bank Act 1997 provides that the bank, in dealing with a regulated business, may among other things:<\/p><blockquote>( a) make the firm&rsquo;s authorisation subject to such conditions or requirements, or both, as it considers appropriate, relating to&mdash; (i) the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of retail credit firms or authorised home reversion firms, and <br \/><br \/>(ii) the protection of their customers or potential customers; <\/blockquote><p>Acceptance of this amendment will involve the deletion of section 2 currently in the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#E00500","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":1384,"content":"<p>The issues in sections 2 and 3 return to the core point of who should be regulated or not, should it be the credit servicing firm or the retail credit firm.  My view is that it should be the retail credit firm, therefore, this would also need to change.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise two points on the new section 2.  I am concerned about the issue of not regulating the credit servicing firm, if the owner of the loans is regulated, because that will become the norm.  Under this legislation, we would regulate the owners with the lightest type of regulation which is the credit servicing firm regulation.  Therefore, the servicing firms that the people deal with and interact with will not be regulated.  The argument for that approach is that the owner is regulated so that they can be pursued.  I am unsure if that is the best approach.  It goes back to the original point of whether we should leave the credit services unregulated under the existing legislation and the owner should be regulated as a retail credit firm, which would resolve this issue and ensure that those who are interacting with individuals, sending out letters in some cases, not responding and so on, cannot take a gloves-off approach because they themselves are not under the scope of the Central Bank as an entity while the fund which contracted their services would be and could be held accountable for their role.  In this scenario, it would be better that both would be regulated.  The new subsection (2) makes it clear that can happen where there is a credit servicing firm that is regulated, and the owner is regulated, that both can coexist but it also allows for them not to coexist, and for one not to be regulated.  I am concerned about that and would like to revisit it on Report Stage.  I say Report Stage because the whole issue of whether it should be a retail credit firm goes to the core of how we approach this legislation.  I would like to hear the Central Bank's view on that.  <\/p> <p>  My second point relates to securitisation.  I am sure that this is not the case, however, where the holder of credit, that is, the vulture fund, secures a part of that debt through the process of securitisation, the vehicle that would be established would not come under the regulation of this Bill.  Is it the case that the owner of the debt would still be regulated?  If a vulture fund secured 15% of the debt through securitisation that would not exempt it from regulation under this legislation.  I refer to section 3 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018071200002#F00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1531387800,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's last question, the holder is the regulated entity.
