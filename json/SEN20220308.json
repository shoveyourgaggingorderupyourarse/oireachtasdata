I congratulate him on the launch of the new Town Centre First policy, which is going to be transformative.  Of course, I am here today as a Senator based in Dublin West and I want us to be part of that.  Town Centre First, for anyone who does not know, is a policy where local communities and businesses will be supported in revitalising towns and villages through tools and supports.  It is about revitalising our communities and, of course, we want to create stronger and safer communities.  This ambitious and far-reaching policy contains a range of measures and funding supports aimed at making towns in the various counties more viable and attractive places in which to live, work and visit, while ensuring they are social, cultural and services hubs for the local community.<\/p> <p>It is not just rural areas that can benefit from this.  As I said, I represent Dublin 15 and Dublin West, which is a collection of various different villages.  They are real villages, like Castleknock village, Blanchardstown village, Clonsilla village, Ongar village and Ashtown village.  During Covid, we saw how people were closer to home.  They were shopping and supporting local, and areas like Blanchardstown saw their greatest footfall ever in the Bank of Ireland and in Supervalu.  We could see the effect this was having on the main street.  The main streets in these areas often suffer because of their proximity to the city centre and they are not an entirely separate entity, as they might be in rural areas.  I do not think we want to go back to a place where those main streets do not get an opportunity to revive as well.  There is an opportunity around ensuring we get the benefit of the digital transformation that we saw in Covid, with people working remotely at home.  We want more people be able to work remotely but, again, we are missing out on the opportunities in these areas.<\/p> <p>I see the Town Centre First model working for areas like this but it is not open to them at the moment.  If we look at the funding streams, there is the urban regional development fund, the rural regional development fund, the town and village renewal scheme and the towns fund for servicing sites for new homes and for the refurbishment of vacant homes.  We do not get access to those.  It is frustrating when we are meeting people from the Tidy Towns or from local groups who see money from these programmes going into other areas but not theirs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They want their community co-working hub and to see community childcare.  They want those things to see the transformation on the main street and to retain people who have been working in the area to keep them coming into their shops, whereby the traditional shops can benefit from it as well.<\/p><p>In conclusion, the model around town teams and the fact there is a regeneration officer and a health check could apply here.  Mobilising different groups and organisations around this model would have a hugely beneficial effect on suburban areas too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#B00300","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Currie for raising this issue, which I will answer on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, who could not make it today.  He is glad the Senator raised this issue, however, because it is certainly something he would like to talk about to focus minds.<\/p> <p>The whole idea behind the Town Centre First policy initiative and framework was to maximise the investment of State resources in our towns and villages right across the country, be they urban or rural.  We would then have a process to maximise that investment and be able to see positive outcomes that benefit the whole town, village and community.  Again, I thank Senator Currie for bringing the focus to the suburban town initiative.  I also recognise her work in this area in making sure we provide our towns and villages with the option of remote working, working from home and in trying to do away with that commute.  Bringing the heart back into our communities and lives is something she has been championing for years.  This initiative should be able to assist with those plans.<\/p> <p>The Town Centre First policy raised by Senator Currie today was launched on 4 February.  It provides a co-ordinated, whole-of-government policy framework to address the decline in the heart of town centres, to provide support measures to regenerate and revitalise them, and, as I said earlier, to maximise the investment in our towns.  The Senator mentioned Blanchardstown and villages like Clonsilla.  All these different villages are part of the initiatives that could come through under this policy.  A key feature of the policy is the preparation of a Town Centre First plan for a town, which will be developed by the local community, supported by the local authority and local business organisations, to identify and analyse the challenges facing the town and to propose initiatives and projects to address them.<\/p> <p>The Town Centre First initiative, therefore, recognises that a solely top-down approach to the development of our towns is not appropriate to the challenges they face.  This is about trying to bring the community together with a list of actions that will help develop our towns over a period and make them much more attractive places in which to live, invest, create jobs and grow a business, as well as in which to raise a family and to be able to naturally expand our community services.  Instead, this document sets out an innovative approach whereby local communities and local businesses can be central to reimagining their own towns and planning their own futures.<\/p> <p>With regard to suburban villages located within the five cities, as Senator Currie quite rightly referenced, these centres are recognised as being the heart of their local communities.  They provide a focus for local activities, allowing sustainable urban living and facilitating people&rsquo;s access to local shops, services, community services, information, healthcare, amenities and the ability to work locally.  They are essential to the economic well-being and quality of life of the city.<\/p> <p>The individual development plans of the metropolitan local authorities include important policies related to regeneration of these areas, which also will tie into the Town Centre First initiative.  Their importance and the need for the strategic regeneration of urban and suburban villages is also strongly reflected across the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, and related metropolitan area strategic plans, MASPs, that have now been produced by the three regional assemblies.<\/p> <p>A number of funding sources are available to support the development and regeneration of such suburban areas including the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, as well as funding for local sustainable transport infrastructure, community facilities, heritage and economic development among other areas available from various Departments and State agencies.  To be clear, that urban regeneration funding should be available to those towns the Senator referenced today.  It absolutely is about developing these plans in conjunction with local authorities to be able to draw down this competitive funding.  Applications for these funds are primarily the responsibility of the relevant local authorities, which, as the planning authorities, are best placed to prioritise and integrate proposals in their operational areas, as advocated by the Town Centre First policy.<\/p> <p>Funding has previously been provided through the urban regeneration and development fund to a number of regeneration projects in suburban village areas to date, including Inchicore in Dublin city and Stillorgan and Dundrum in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, as well as a range of integrated regeneration projects in Tallaght, for example.<\/p> <p>There will be a third call to the local authorities for project proposals for the URDF in the second half of 2022.  This will include inviting projects specifically focused on implementation of the Town Centre First policy.  In addition, the establishment of a national Town Centre First office will support the achievement of impactful regeneration nationwide through the development of a Town Centre First toolkit, bringing together all the best people and the vested agencies to work with local people to maximise their actions and approaches.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This toolkit of best practice will inform the local approaches to regeneration and will encompass specific strands targeting key factors such as urban development, economic enterprise development, community engagement, digitalisation, climate action and others. <\/p><p>As towns or suburban areas and communities develop their town action plans, different funding streams will feed into them.

It does not mean that the results will be seen in year 1 but over a couple of years, as one wins and secures funding from different Government initiatives and funds to feed into the plan to make it happen over a period.  All the areas that the Senator mentioned earlier will be quite capable of being able to draw down that funding. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#C00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>When I talk to local authorities about access to town and village and the urban regeneration development fund and even the regional enterprise funding that is available, they say they are not able to get support from those schemes.

To be clear, the understanding when we set up the urban and rural regeneration funds was that they would achieve the same thing in different settings because they are funded by two different Departments.  The majority of towns and villages, and certainly the ones mentioned by Senator Currie, are meant to be part of that.  That was always my understanding when it was done and talking to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, before today's debate, and based on the response to the Senator's question that I read, that is the aim.<\/p> <p>We can engage with local authorities to see if there is misrepresentation or misunderstanding.  In some cases, towns and villages are grouped together to ensure that they come under the different population numbers.  However, Blanchardstown, Clonee and Castleknock are areas that would need intervention by the State in conjunction with local communities and businesses.  The Senator is right to call them out here.  She asked if we will see tweaks to the Town Centre First initiative.  I would imagine that in the coming years different schemes and funding measures will be brought forward as well as tweaks.  Even with existing schemes, there are mechanisms there to find the funding that is needed for towns and villages.<\/p> <p>I will bring this back to the Minister of State who can probably talk to the Senator about this directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#D00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry","time":1646749800,"counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#D00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this question.  Trade policy and import substitution is an area in which he has a strong interest.  Today, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is meeting various farm organisations.  One thing he will encourage is increasing grain production to help provide greater domestic food security.  This is something that will be very welcome if it can be done and I am quite certain that our farmers and farm organisations can step up to the plate.<\/p> <p>The average person in Ireland eats 54 kg of flour per year, that is quite a bit of bread and bread products, yet over 80% of the flour we use in Ireland is imported.  The bulk of this comes from the UK.  Something that the special committee on Brexit explored in detail is that much of the flour that we import from the UK is made with imported wheat, a lot of it coming from Canada.  Under the EU rules of origin that flour is subject to tariffs and if the non-EU content is more than 15% it is subject to the full tariffs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is already contributing to some of the cost pressures that are in place.<\/p><p>When it was before the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, Enterprise Ireland highlighted the need to look at import substitution for those that use flour in Ireland to change supply chains.   This is a view that was shared by Food Drink Ireland.  On top of that we see the pressure that Russia's disgraceful invasion of Ukraine will put on global food security.  About one quarter of the world's wheat exports come from that region and even though we do not import much wheat from there directly, there will be a knock-on impact if wheat from that region is not contributing towards the world supply.<\/p><p>There are food security issues in parts of the Middle East, which I have spoken about in this House before and there will be knock-on implications on the supply coming in here.  I was looking at the Chicago commodities futures market and wheat prices are 70% higher now than at the start of the year.  Last week, wheat futures contracts had their largest price increase since 1959.  We will see a major problem around wheat supply and as we are importing a lot of flour produced from imported wheat we should be certain that this will impact here.<\/p><p>If we produce all that additional grain how can we ensure that we will have commercial mills in Ireland again?  There are a number of small mills here but supports should be put in place for the flour we use in our bread.  A pair of brothers in County Wexford, Andrew and Raymond Kavanagh, have planning permission for a full commercial mill.  They have yet to receive much support from Enterprise Ireland, in spite of some of the discussions around the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  If we look at import substitution we have to be in a position where we support those brothers or others who may wish to develop commercial mills around Ireland.  We are inviting the farmers to grow more wheat so for the purposes of food security what guarantees can we put in place to ensure that we will have sufficient access to flour and ideally that we will have import substitution such that we can produce it here?  I ask the Minister of State to meet those brothers or to arrange through his office for Enterprise Ireland to meet them.  Food security, on a global and domestic level, is important and it is particularly important given the importance of flour to our diet.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#D00500","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  We have had to have an important conversation on import substitution and food security.  In recent years our supply chains were tested by Brexit, then Covid and now the terrible events and atrocities in Ukraine.  There is an urgency around looking at food security issues, and import substitution is something that is close to my heart and which we have discussed in this House before.  Covid and Brexit have taught us that we need to look at that again and seek out any opportunity we can to produce at home on our shores.  That in turn creates jobs and gives us added security and opportunities.  I would be happy to explore these options with the Senator.<\/p> <p>The events of the last two weeks in Ukraine have brought about a different conversation and they have brought much more urgency to that issue.  The Government is monitoring the impacts of this crisis closely.  We have been working closely with our EU partners and fellow member states on the adoption of sanctions in response to Russia&rsquo;s violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity.  Ireland is fully committed to the comprehensive implementation of the four EU sanctions packages adopted to date, which will have an impact on our economy and industries.  We have to plot a course through that to assist businesses and domestic customers through those difficult times.<\/p> <p>While the effects of the series of sanctions being implemented may not be directly significant for Ireland, the Irish economy remains exposed to the indirect spillover effects resulting from the sanctions and the general geopolitical instability.  We can see the price increases in many sectors already.  Sanctions will not be cost-free for Ireland or for other EU member states, as evidenced now by the sharp increase in flour prices and in the price of other commodities but we were left with little choice due to Russia&rsquo;s behaviour.  We all agree that this is important but we also have to find ways to manage this for our economy.  Russia and Ukraine account for one third of global grain production, while the EU imports more than two fifths of its gas demand from Russia.  It goes without saying that Russia&rsquo;s systemic role in energy supply will have significant impacts on prices because some the costs of flour production are down to both the price of grain and the price of energy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The implications for inflation and production costs are also significant because of those energy costs.  Unfortunately, pass-through price effects are expected in other sectors apart from flour production, such as fertilisers, fuel and transport costs.  The knock-on effect will be quite serious.  I am aware that representations have been made by the bakery sector on the implications of flour and gas costs on the price of bread and other products.  My Department is working with our enterprise agencies and other Departments, including the establishment by the Taoiseach of a new group at Secretary General level, to update, advise and co-ordinate all aspects of our response to the conflict, to assess the full impacts of the sanctions and to develop mitigations and contingency plans to support enterprise and traders.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there will be no easy solutions to addressing the indirect consequences of imposing these sanctions on Russia and Belarus.  The question of implementing measures on a sectoral basis would require careful consideration and should be balanced by consideration of other potential mechanisms in addressing the impact on the most vulnerable consumers and sectors.  On flour production and flour milling in general, we need to look into the feasibility of doing further processing in Ireland.  It is something we should look at, exactly as the Senator said.  Since Brexit, the rules of origin impact on flour have resulted in unintended consequences because we import most of our flour from the UK, and through Canada, although recently imports from Northern Ireland have surged, thus avoiding potential tariffs and cross-border delays.  I agree with the Senator that it is probably opportune to look specifically at the issue of supporting companies and the feasibility of doing further processing and flour milling in Ireland to secure our supply of this vital ingredient.<\/p><p>I certainly have an interest in organising that meeting with Enterprise Ireland and will join it I can.  If there are guys like Andrew Kavanagh and Raymond Kavanagh, who are seeking support to make this happen and already have planning permission, I would be very interested in seeing how we can progress that for them and for others.  While the Government will intervene in different ways to deal with the current pressure right now, the Deputy is suggesting it deals with the long-term solution, which is something we should certainly be looking at.  I am happy to work with the Senator on it.  I will talk to our guys in Enterprise Ireland to see if we can organise a meeting to make that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#E00200","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for agreeing to that meeting.

From this point of view, certainly when it comes to flour and milling, if there is an opportunity there we should develop it.<\/p> <p>On the sanctions and what is happening with Russia, the ultimate and most ideal solution to the crisis is for Russia to withdraw its forces and uphold international humanitarian and human rights law.

It brings LGBT tourism into the city and creates an opportunity to give credence and voice to LGBTQ playwrights and productions that may not get that same opportunity in other countries.<\/p> <p>Dublin Gay Theatre Festival has appealed on a number of grounds as to why its funding has been cut.  It has sought answers and remedy to the situation.  As far as it and I can tell, answers or information have not been forthcoming.  There does not seem to be a reason to have cut this funding.  It seems quite unusual to have just cut funding for no reason whatsoever, especially on something as crucial as LGBTQ issues.<\/p> <p>I hope it is not due to the assumption that because we have marriage equality, we do not need to protect, support or enhance LGBTQ issues and voices in Ireland.  I hope that is not the case.  I know that some people, when we talk about LGBTQ issues, say that we have marriage equality and everything is grand.<\/p> <p>Even if all was well, good and dandy for the LGBTQ community in Ireland, of which I am member, we could not agree that it was the same for LGBTQ communities the world over.  This is an international theatre festival.  It brings voices, productions and playwrights, globally, to Ireland.  It is not just us gays who go to it.  International LGBTQ people come to it.  We could not, in good faith, say that the situation is the same the world over.<\/p> <p>This theatre festival gives voice, credence and space to productions that would otherwise not have been produced, as far as we are aware.  Certainly, a number of the people who have come to the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival previously have said they would not have had an opportunity to produce or bring forward these plays beforehand.<\/p> <p>The festival is brilliant for tourism and bringing people to Dublin.  As someone who used to work in theater, I know it is a great stomping ground.  That stomping ground as a place to stretch one's play-writing experience and imagination and get international recognition is very important.<\/p> <p>It is devastating that this funding has been lost.  The people at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival do not really understand why it has been lost.  No answer has been forthcoming.  Is the Minister or the Department aware of this?  Do they have any plans to support this vital international gay theatre festival?  It is running on no money and it is not good enough that LGBTQ productions and theatre are pushed to the side again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#G00300","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I will take this Commencement matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank Senator Hoey for the opportunity to discuss this matter.  The Arts Council is the statutory body charged with supporting developing arts in Ireland.  When it comes to funding the arts in any democratic state, the arms length principle is a fundamental tenet in Government funding of arts.  The arms length principle recognises that it would not be appropriate for Ministers and politicians to be in a position to decide which artistic endeavours should be funded and which should not.  For this reason, the legislation under which the Arts Council is constituted, the Arts Act 2003, includes a provision, at section 24(2), that ensures the council is independent in its funding decisions.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, therefore, is statutorily precluded from intervening in how and to whom the Arts Council commits its funding.<\/p><p>I recognise and understand the sentiments behind requests to a Minister to intervene with the Arts Council on behalf of organisations that have been refused funding by the council, but I would defend the law in this case by saying that artistic freedom would suffer if Ministers could direct the council on who it should fund.  The maintenance of this approach between the Arts Council and the role of the Minister also ensures that all funding decisions are above reproach.  I understand that the Arts Council provides detailed feedback on unsuccessful applications and has an appeals process in place.  I recommend that the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival adopt this approach.<\/p><p>Across its various funding schemes, the Arts Council supports more than 160 festivals annually.  Through its festival investment scheme, the council makes significant investment in festivals nationwide.  The addition of festivals supported under the arts grant and strategic funding schemes ensures that there is a flexible and comprehensive support for festivals in Ireland.  The council recognises the distinctive role arts festivals play in sustaining a vibrant and sustainable arts profile at local level.  Festivals provide opportunities for artists and audiences to experience new work and ways of making work.<\/p><p>There is no funding or revenue stream in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media that provides funding to organisations which have been refused funding by the Arts Council and there are no plans to introduce one.  However, the Department does operate a small-scale local festivals and summer schools funding scheme.  The scheme is designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other essential Government moneys and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council or similar bodies.  This scheme is currently open for applications on the Department's website.  In addition, Senator Hoey may be interested to note that a number of local authorities support small-scale festivals, in some cases, under the all-of-Government Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022, led by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#G00400","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response but I am not asking that anyone directs the Arts Council to fund this festival or to change its funding system.  The issue I am raising is that there seems to be no other revenue stream or way to fund this festival.  The festival has gone through the appeals process and the issue is that process.  The appeal is about the process, not about the decision.  There is no way, as far as I can tell, for the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival to even find out why the funding has been cut.  It is concerning that funding can be cut without any reason being given.  That is very worrying.  This festival has been running for 19 years, with 48 plays published, but now, after two decades of success, it is going to be left with nothing.  This theatre festival was incredibly important, not just for Irish but for international LGBTQ theatre.  It was good for queer voices and it is really important that it is supported and not left to collapse.  I am just devastated to see that this is going to happen to such a brilliant festival.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#H00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Hoey for her remarks and reiterate, as I said earlier, that the council does provide detailed feedback on unsuccessful applications and that there is an appeals process.

As a result of that review, a decision was made to close a number of them, some more controversially than others.  Specifically in my area, the Garda station at Kill of the Grange, 300 m away from where I grew up, was one of the ones that was closed.  The second one was in Dalkey.  Those two buildings have lain idle since they were closed in 2012 and 2013, respectively.  Dalkey was closed in June 2012 and Kill of the Grange in April 2013.  They are two significant buildings.  In the case of Dalkey, it is part of the heritage town.  The building itself is an old structure full of character and heritage.  The Garda station in Kill of the Grange is slightly more modern but it is still a significant landmark at the bottom of Rochestown Avenue.<\/p><p>These are two buildings that could definitely be put to use, but which have been empty or idle since they closed.  I know that people have been living in the buildings in a caretaker capacity.  That is something the Office of Public Works, OPW, has done and does with other buildings.  I understand that it takes time to repurpose buildings such as these and that there is a process that must be gone through whereby an alternative State function is sought, a building is put on sale or a community function is also considered.  That is the order in which the alternatives are considered.  I do not have a difficulty with any of that, what I have a difficulty with is that the Garda stations have been closed for ten and nine years, respectively.  The communities in those areas have no use of those buildings and the people in those areas have to look at them, essentially derelict or unused.  Even though people may be living in them, they are not buildings that are interacting with the community around them, which is a real shame because both buildings are significant landmarks.  The Garda station in Dalkey is on Tubbermore Road, a residential road, right in the centre of the village.  People live adjacent to it.  It is such a beautiful building, and it is a crying shame for it to go unused for so long.<\/p><p>In the case of Kill of the Grange, I understand that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has indicated a preference to purchase the building and that a purchase price has been agreed.  I also understand that it was done in 2019 and yet here we are in 2022 and there has been no movement regarding the sale of the property.  My understanding of the way these things work is that the Valuation Office sets the purchase price, and the council agrees to it.  As far as I know, that has been done, yet Kill of the Grange Garda station is essentially empty and derelict.  It is a not insubstantial plot.  I do not understand why the council has not bought it yet.<\/p><p>What I am looking for today is some kind of commitment that we will move on with these buildings; that we will recognise that they have a role in the streetscape and the community in which they are based.  They can be very easily repurposed and they have a value and we should move on with giving them that value within the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#H00500","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I am responding to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy O'Donovan.  I thank Senator Ward for raising the issue, which is rather ironic, allowing for the fact that I also grew up at the opposite end of Rochestown Avenue.  I must make that declaration of interest.  I well know the two buildings to which the Senator refers.  He makes some very valid points in his contribution about them and their role within the community.<\/p> <p>The OPW has responsibility on behalf of the State for managing and maintaining a substantial and complex estate, comprising approximately 2,500 properties valued at &euro;3.3 billion in total.  This extensive and diverse portfolio of State properties includes office accommodation for all Departments, the property estate for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and numerous properties for State agencies.  The portfolio also encompasses specialised spaces such as public offices, laboratories and cultural institutions, in addition to warehouses, heritage properties, visitor centres and sites.  In any major portfolio, there will always be a certain level of vacant properties.  It is normal to have an amount of space vacant, or vacant properties, at any given time, as the portfolio could not function without the flexibility that it provides.  Not all vacant properties will be deemed surplus to the State's requirements or deemed suitable for disposal.<\/p> <p>The OPW has actively pursued its disposal policy in recent years.  From 2014 to 2021, the OPW has disposed of 128 surplus properties, generating an income in excess of &euro;22 million.  The disposal programme will continue throughout 2022 and 2023 for 99 currently surplus properties, with three auctions already planned.  The OPW, by default, consults with local authorities, the HSE, Departments, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and other State bodies in relation to any vacant building or site that is surplus to its requirements.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Colm Brophy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The purpose of the consultation with other State bodies is to ascertain a State use or public interest in advance of a decision to sell on the open market.  Over the past number of years, the OPW has facilitated a number of property disposals to other public bodies to help meet challenges in the housing area in particular.  If no State use is identified, the OPW considers if open market disposal is an option, depending on prevailing market conditions.  Alternatively, the OPW may consider community involvement, subject to a detailed submission that demonstrates that the community or voluntary group seeking to use the property has the means to insure, maintain and manage it in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer.  As part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's 2012 rationalisation programme, the former Garda station at Dalkey closed on 30 June 2012.  From 2014 to 2018, the OPW entered into a pilot guardianship project with Camelot Properties for both the Dalkey and Kill of the Grange properties.  In 2019 D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council expressed an interest in acquiring the former Garda station property, a protected structure, for social housing.  The council carried out an inspection in late 2019 and subsequently advised the OPW that the property did not meet its requirements, taking account of the substantial costs required to repurpose the property.  The OPW received a request in October 2020 to facilitate the housing of Syrian refugees in the property.  As the property had already been assessed for housing by the local authority and deemed unsuitable, the OPW was unable to accede to this request.  As no alternative State requirement has been identified, the OPW plans to dispose of the property.  The registration process is currently being progressed with a view to placing the property on the open market for disposal.<\/p><p>Similarly, the former Garda station at Kill of the Grange closed on 29 April 2013 and a pilot guardianship project was entered into with Camelot Properties in 2014.  In 2019 D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council expressed an interest in acquiring the former Garda station property under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars.  The OPW requested the Valuation Office to conduct a valuation of the property on 13 February 2020, which was received on 19 November 2020.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council formally advised the OPW in September 2021 that the council wished to proceed with the acquisition of the property and confirmed this in February 2022.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office has prepared contracts for sale and the OPW and the council are working to complete the transfer in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#J00200","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":35,"content":"<p> I thank the Minister of State for that very comprehensive reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#K00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I am not sure I agree on how comprehensive the reply is, to be honest.  Obviously the Department has set out the basis on which these buildings are repurposed and disposed of.  It does not account for the glacial pace at which it is done.  The people who live in Dalkey and Kill of the Grange are entitled to expect that these significant buildings in their areas, in the case of Dalkey an historic building, are properly repurposed.  It should not take a decade to do that.  It should not be the case that I ask this question and now we are told that the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO, is preparing contracts.  This is something that should happen as a matter of course.  In the course of the Minister of State's response, the suggestion that the OPW has done this for 128 properties over the course of seven years is not something to trumpet as progress.  It takes far too long.  These are valuable, beautiful buildings in the centre of suburban areas that could absolutely be used tomorrow if the Department was willing to move and to facilitate their sale or whatever it might be.

I remember when I once had a motion down - I cannot remember what it was about - and I was giving two minutes and two minutes to different people to speak.  John came up to me and said, &quot;Can I have two minutes to speak on your motion?&quot;  I told him, &quot;Of course you can, I welcome anybody speaking in favour of my motion&quot;.He said, &quot; Oh I'm not speaking in favour I'm speaking against it.&quot;  That was him.

I remember him singing in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  I cannot recall the song but it was some quite ordinary song which he sang in six or seven different languages.  John was quite a polymath.  He was also quite a distinguished author.  He wrote a history of University College Cork, <i>The College: The History of Queens' University College Cork<\/i>.

I am looking forward to having a discussion and listening to the Senator's experiences.<\/p> <p>I salute the wonderful work that communities in Kildare and right around the country are doing to support Ukrainians.  Collections of money and goods, cake sales and coffee mornings are being run by sporting clubs, communities and local businesses.  They are incredible.  People are gathering to take Ukrainians into their homes.<\/p> <p>In 2003, I worked with the best group of people I could ever imagine when setting up the host town programme for that year's world games.  The people in 180 towns right around the island of Ireland opened their homes and hearts to people from all over the world.  I am seeing that happen again now.  People are opening their homes to Ukrainians.  I and the group of people with whom I worked 19 years ago spent all weekend gathering all the papers and information we had and bringing it all up to date to summarise how a community should prepare for a delegation.  We are making that information available to the Irish Red Cross and any organisation that wants it to support those delegations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#P00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Like some who have already spoken and, I have no doubt, others who are going to speak, I acknowledge that today is International Women's Day.

The inequality women have experienced over many decades has largely been a result of the negligence of men.

Our Defence Forces is closely aligned with NATO and whether or not we become a member of NATO is another topic entirely, but to be militarily non-aligned is not to be neutral.

This is something we need to follow up on.  We are living in unprecedented times and every available space must be used, particularly when people are generous enough to open up their own homes.  For those who have not looked at the portal, when I looked at it last night, it was down for some substantial time, which goes to show that the Irish people and people living in Ireland really want to be part of offering our solidarity within our own homes and within our own country.<\/p><p>We have had more than 2,000 people arrive in Ireland already.  The majority have gone to their families and the rest have been put up in hotel accommodation for the moment.  Looking at the faces of the children who are fleeing their native land, as I am sure we have all seen, they all have an expectation of being at home, being with their friends and being in their schools very soon, as I am sure our children would too, but we really do not know how long this will be.  This really is an effort from every single person.  Wartime is a long-distant memory for many of us, or not a memory at all, but I think we will see that it will call on every part of ourselves and our resources to be able to do something, and that means doing something across social protection, education and fuel.  It will really mean a huge effort.<\/p><p>I would like to point to the announcement today of a temporary school for the next two years for the Galway Educate Together secondary school.

We saw the passage through this House recently of the stalking Bill and in the last term we worked very well on the domestic violence Bill, which saw coercive control deemed a criminal offence.  At this point in time, given events in Ukraine and globally, we know that issues like war, ecological destruction, increased energy prices and the cost of living, poverty, conflict and, in our own experience, the legacy of conflict all disproportionately impact upon women.  While it is important to acknowledge and celebrate the women in our lives, whether they are indigenous women, women of colour, women with disabilities or trans women, and it is right that we celebrate and acknowledge them, it is also important to remember there is a sentiment and a purpose behind International Women's Day, and that is to ensure, as Senator Conway said, equality and justice for all women, no matter where they are.<\/p> <p>It would be timely if we could have a discussion on UN Resolution 1325, which I know this State adopted.

I want to briefly talk about International Women's Day in Ukraine.  It could be argued that war is one of the most gendered of experiences.  While men in the main depart their homes to fight at the front lines, women and their children in general are left with few options - stand to protect their homes, organise resistance movements or flee.  War visits particular suffering on women with the loss of their partners, homes, jobs, fathers, brothers, children and autonomy.<\/p><p>I read the United Nations Population Fund report on women's experience of war in Ukraine, which stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn the days since Russia launched a military offensive in Ukraine, the world has seen the photographs of women giving birth in underground metro stations and newborns hastily being moved to makeshift bomb shelters as health facilities become inaccessible or too damaged to function.  An estimated 80,000 women will give birth in the next three months in Ukraine &ndash; many of them without access to critical maternal health care.  For some, childbirth will be a life-threatening rather than a life-changing experience. <\/blockquote> <p>I was following the news earlier when the Ukrainian President reported that a child has allegedly died of dehydration in Mariupol, Ukraine.  Today, I stand in solidarity with the women of Ukraine and all women who are affected by war in all nations.  We, as a neutral nation, will have our role to play in this conflict.  I ask Government Members today to fight to place the needs of women in the conflicts at the heart of that response.  Perhaps it could be worth convening a discussion on that response in this House in the coming weeks.  On International Women's Day, I say to Ukrainian women, and people living in Ireland and abroad, that we offer them our deepest <i>solidarnist<\/i>.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise with regard to International Women's Day is that of Traveller and Roma women across the world.  As Senator Flynn has put it to us, we must all stand up in this House as allies.  I will read out some of the statistics on Traveller women, which are a real stain on our country.  Traveller women die 11 and a half years younger, suicide rates are six times higher, only 1% of Travellers reach third level education and more than 80% are rearing children without water or toilets in their homes.  In the words of Traveller activist Rosemary Maughan, whose handle on Twitter is @Minceirbeoir, this is &quot;cultural genocide&quot;.  On International Women's Day, therefore, we should and must be allies to all women.  Our feminism must be intersectional and we need to tear those patriarchal structures down and karate-chop them back into the past, exactly where they belong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#S00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#S00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Civil Engagement Group, I wish all women in civil society a happy International Women's Day.

The answer is clearly not.  For instance, homelessness levels have increased.  We saw the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report last year that let children tell us in their own words how their right to safe and secure accommodation has been violated.<\/p><p>The National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum and all Traveller women have been fighting for decades for a higher standard of Traveller accommodation, better outcomes for our children and for ourselves in education, better employment opportunities and better access to health services, including targeted mental health supports and a strategy to address the Traveller mental health crisis, when we know that Traveller women are six times more likely to die by suicide than women in the general population.  The fight continues and so does the struggle for wider gender equality and recognition.  Traveller women&rsquo;s views are rarely looked for when wider gender policy is developed by Government.  At the same time, we know that Traveller women are making important contributions to Irish society in many different professions.  <\/p><p>The phrase &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t see it, you can&rsquo;t be it&rdquo; is important but often thrown around.  Many Traveller women see it but while we have the ability and the desire to be it, unfortunately the opportunities are not always there for us and for our community.  What we want, and what the National Traveller Women's Forum wants, is a better and brighter future for our children, our grandchildren and for the next generation. <\/p><p>The National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum in standing in solidarity with all ethnic minority women today and women in Ireland who experience systemic racism and sexism.

At the weekend I had the privilege of being invited to Ukraine by President Zelensky's party.  I travelled with Billy Kelleher MEP to Lviv.  We had an invitation to see at first hand the crisis on the other side of the border.  It would be an understatement to say that the scenes there are heart wrenching.  For miles, there are people queuing to cross the border on foot and there are probably up to 20 km of cars with people there for days.  It really is a testament to the strength of their character that they have kept it together.  I have heard other world leaders suggest that it will not remain like that.  I would not be surprised.  It is a stretch to expect people to remain calm in these very difficult circumstances.<\/p> <p>What needs to happen?  Europe needs to put in more effort on both sides of the border.  The Polish Government is working well once people get across the border.  It has the appropriate infrastructure in place to process and move people on to various locations to which they might want to go or be housed.  However, on the Ukrainian side, it is devastating.  The temperatures are still very low.  It is -5 &deg;C at night.  Thankfully it was not snowing on Sunday and Monday but you cannot expect women and children to stand for a day and a half in -5 &deg;C.  I do not think it is something that anyone here would ever want to contemplate.  It is not just women and children.  It is aged men and women as well.  Probably the most heart wrenching thing is to see elderly mothers pushing clearly physically disabled children in wheelchairs for days.  There is a requirement on us to act.

They want more direct support and financial aid to purchase humanitarian equipment that is needed, including baby food of all sorts.  They recognise Ireland's neutrality so they know we will not provide lethal aid but they want non-lethal aid like helmets, life vests and other non-lethal equipment.  There is a recognition that all countries bordering Ukraine have done well in assisting but that more can be done.

A report late last year found that the awards had fallen by an average of 40% since the problem of disproportionate payouts was addressed by the Government and the Judiciary, which is to be welcomed.  The insurance companies identified the cost of claims as the key driver of insurance costs and we have done our side of the deal in bringing those more into line with international levels.  Insurance companies must act in good faith in return and pass on this reduction in costs to the insurer, rather than maintaining current premium growth rates and simply pocketing the profits.<\/p> <p>Much attention was paid to small shops and community businesses during the pandemic, and rightly so.

Aside from businesses, volunteer community groups throughout the country are having their activities severely curtailed or cancelled altogether by insurance requirements accompanied by premiums that are simply unpayable.  Whether it is beach clean-ups, graveyard maintenance, work with refugees or sports camps, community initiatives that enable people to give back to their communities and build them up in the process should enjoy every possible support we can give them.  That is why consideration should be given to allowing community groups to access insurance through the public participation network, via their local council, and be insured at a lower rate through Irish public bodies.  That would seem to deal with much of the issue and would be a step in the right direction in supporting community initiatives.  Perhaps we can have a debate on this in the House.<\/p><p>Before I finish, I will tell everybody that there will be a coffee morning in Leinster House tomorrow morning.

I believe it should be a time of review and reflection.  Typically, it fills me with hope and renewed commitment to the cause of equality.  This year's theme, break the bias, certainly hammers that home.  I am also using this week to reflect on lessons learned from some of the amazing women from the midlands I have had the privilege to meet in my roles as Minister of State, Senator and a member of my community.  They include women who have overcome personal tragedy to lead their family farms and businesses, Traveller women who, despite facing bias and discrimination, are working hard to help others, women and girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, sport and politics, and women who lead in activism to protect this beautiful planet we call home.  These are women who inspire us all each and every day.<\/p> <p>Mn&aacute; 100 celebrates the women of 1916, many of whom have been forgotten over this past century.  These include women such as &Aacute;ine N&iacute; Riain who was living in Offaly when she took part in the 1916 Rising.  As a member of Tullamore's Cumann na mBan, she served at Reis's Chambers, the Hibernian Bank and the GPO garrison until 28 April which, as she later recounted, she only left by order of P.H. Pearse.  They also include women such as 23-year-old nurse Mary McDonald from Abbeyleix, who was training as a midwife at the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital during Easter 1916.  When the British military occupied the hospital, Mary and the staff were given orders to get on with their work, not to go out of doors and to keep away from the windows.  Mary later recalled that \"Shots and explosions were then the order of the day, we did our work, ate our short ration.\"<\/p> <p>This is but a snapshot of some of the wonderful women of the midlands, past and present.  As the phrase \"nothing about me without me\" goes, today we celebrate and thank those women for inspiring us to break the bias and move us ever closer to an equal Ireland for every woman.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#V00700","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I wish everybody a very happy International Women's Day.<\/p> <p>I too will raise issues around the crisis in Ukraine.

We need to recognise their contribution.  It is astounding to see those who are looking to help registering with the Red Cross.  I also suggest we look at those who have holiday homes throughout the country.

We need to express our solidarity with those countries and provide them with the necessary support.<\/p><p>Schuman, one of the founders of the European Union as it is now, when he started speaking about the future of Europe, said that much of Europe would be forged out of crisis.

I will keep going on this roll.  I thank the Minister for Transport.  I have brought up the issue of the N24, almost on a weekly basis, for the past couple of months because it was taken off the list of priorities.  In fairness to the Minister, he has listened to the concerns that I and colleagues have raised over the past number of months, especially councillors.<\/p> <p>I commend Councillor Marie Murphy in Tipperary and the cathaoirleach, Councillor Pat Dunphy, in Kilkenny and a range of councillors who have all come together as part of our first citizens' forum in the south east.  They have used this issue, together, to fight to get it back on the list.  I thank the Minister for listening to all of us make that case.  It was stopping housing projects, as well.

I have no doubt that the money off electricity bills will be welcomed by many people across the country who are struggling with their energy costs.  However, during the Committee Stage debate on the Bill I flagged my concern that the Government was planning to use funds allocated for energy poverty retrofits for the electricity credit.  Today at the Oireachtas Select Committee on Environment and Climate Action, it emerged that the Better Energy Communities, BEC, scheme's budget is being slashed by &euro;19 million, a 30% cut, in order to pay for the &euro;200 electricity credit.  It is deeply frustrating that &euro;19 million is being taken from energy poverty retrofits when as much as &euro;26 million is funding electricity credits for holiday homes and vacant properties.<\/p> <p>I tabled very practical amendments to the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill that would have prevented energy poverty alleviation funds from being misused like this but they were defeated.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications was categorical in his response when he said that funding for the credit would not come out of energy poverty measures but it now appears that the Minister misled the Seanad.  I would like to invite him back to correct the record.  <\/p> <p>More needs to be done to get a handle on the crisis but it has to be done in a progressive way.  The Minister is plundering the budgets of schemes that are designed to help the most vulnerable while energy companies are recording record profits.  I would prefer to see the Government taxing the windfall profits of energy companies and reinvesting the revenue in measures that would help people in energy poverty with renovations and develop renewable electricity.  I call on the Leader to write to the Minister to ask him to correct the statement in which he categorically denied that a cut was going to be made to the energy poverty retrofit scheme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#X00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Today I want to talk about problems facing community centres in Dublin West although I imagine there are community centres all over the country that are facing the same problems.

Such work can include fire safety works, as is the case in Huntstown and Hartstown community centres.  This work must be undertaken because both centres are home to childcare facilities and pre-schools but the money is not there to do it.  We are talking here about six figure sums for the work that is needed but it is not realistic to expect the community centres to rely entirely on the local community to pay for that work.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government, I am glad to say, references small-scale funding for community centres but I urge the Government not to underestimate the size of the fund required, the scale of the works that are required and the number of community centres that need funding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If I am talking about two in my area, and a third community centre that is owned by the community, then let us multiply that by however many to get to where we need to be.

In D&uacute;n Laoghaire we are very lucky to have excellent facilities.  We also have an elite training unit for Olympic athletes.  Sailing is a sport that is very often practised by only a small number of people, despite the fact that it should be readily available to much larger groups within society.  It is also a sport where men and women can participate as part of a team.  That is appropriate today in particular given that it is International Women's Day.  Sailing provides an opportunity to bring people together.  It is a sport that is very healthy but is also very environmentally friendly.  More importantly, it is a sport that should be practised more in our island community.  The fact is that none of us live very far away from the sea, even people in the midlands.  Sailing is done on lakes as well as by the coasts throughout the country.<\/p> <p>The time has come for the Government to invest in water sports centres around the country.  I know of a project that is going on in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to repurpose the ferry terminal that was abandoned by Stena almost seven years ago.

It behoves the Government to invest in exactly this kind of healthy sporting opportunity for communities at every level, age, ability and gender.  The time has come for the Government to put in place a particular programme to support not just sailing but all water sports through targeted investment in water-adjacent communities, be they near lakes, rivers or coastal areas.  I would like us to have a debate on that to see if there is something the Government can do to properly foster a water sports tradition in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#Y00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their contribution.  Two themes stand out, the first being International Women's Day.  I wish all women across the country and the world a happy International Women's Day.  It is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women but of course not everyone is going to enjoy this day in the same way as others.  The second theme that emerged as a major issue was Ukraine.  Clearly, there are millions of women and children in Ukraine that are having a very pitiful, worrying and sorrowful International Women's Day and our thoughts and prayers go to all of them.  I commend Senator Dooley and Billy Kelleher, MEP, on their trip to Ukraine at the weekend.  It was an important initiative to hear and see at first hand from those in authority and to see in real life what we see on the screens.  Senator Dooley talked about what is needed in terms of equipment.  Senator O'Loughlin commented on support for Ukrainians and her work in the past in opening homes for the Special Olympics.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Following the establishment of the portal yesterday, so many Irish people are offering to open their homes to Ukrainians.  Certainly there will be some issues there in terms of vetting and child protection issues that will have to be sorted but certainly the spirit of generosity is there.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly talked about approved housing bodies not allowing some of their homes to be made available or rooms within their homes to be made available.  I certainly hope that the committee within Cabinet that is dealing with Ukraine can examine that and see the rationale as to why that is happening.  It really should not be happening.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about an invitation to President Zelenskiy.  We can certainly take that up with the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.  Perhaps the Leas-Cathaoirleach will raise it with the Cathaoirleach in his absence and with the Ceann-Comhairle to see about a joint sitting to invite President Zelenskiy.  I will ask the Leas-Cathaoirleach to take the matter up with the Cathaoirleach.<\/p><p>Arising out the issues in Ukraine, Senator Malcolm Byrne also talked of a debate on the future of Europe.  I will certainly ask for that.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell touched on the issue of neutrality.  Many of the issues that have come to the fore over the last period of time have always been there.  We have a situation whereby as a neutral country we will not support the purchase of a tank for example, but we will support the purchase of fuel to run the tank.  There is a slight anomaly there in my view; it is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  There is a serious debate needed in respect of this matter.  Some would say that Ukraine was attacked because it was becoming closer to NATO, but it is not a member of NATO.  The question is whether if it was a member of NATO, would it have been attacked.  That question is extremely important.  That is not to say that I believe we should join NATO, but there are serious questions here regarding our role and our security.  If we cannot defend our nation, who are we going to get to defend us should something happen?  People will say who is going to invade us?  In 20 or 30 years' time, who knows who might invade or what sort of madmen will be out there.<\/p><p>Senator Norris opened the proceedings with a tribute to the former Senator, the late John A. Murphy.  I know the Leas-Cathaoirleach will have that arranged to be sent together with other contributions as well last week, during the minute's silence and tributes to the family.<\/p><p>Senator Conway talked about International Women's Day in the context of Brigid Hogan-O'Higgins, the former Deputy who represented East Galway and who will celebrate her 90th birthday on Thursday.  She was first elected to the 16th D&aacute;il in 1957.  We remember her and her contribution at a time when women in politics were very rare.<\/p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly talked of her disappointment regarding the fur farming Bill.  There was an issue with section 7 of that Bill in terms of the engagement with the fur farmers.  We are talking about only three farmers, but they have rights.  They employ a significant number of workers.  Discussions need to take place and be concluded with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Obviously, not wanting to prejudice those discussions, there was some concern expressed in the House regarding accepting section 7 of the Bill in advance of concrete information on what is happening in regard to compensation.  That was the reason the Bill was pulled for today.  If there are more concrete developments in the next few days, I hope that the debate on the Bill can proceed later in the week.<\/p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly also talked about the great news in regard to the temporary school building for Galway Educate Together.  The school has been operating in temporary accommodation that is no longer fit for purpose.  The Department has come up with school buildings in Newtownsmith in the heart of Galway city.  That is a positive development.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donngaile talked about International Women's Day.  He is right of course, women are very often the most impacted by poverty, war, cost of living, and unfortunately we see women and children leaving in their droves from Ukraine.  There will be millions of people displaced depending on how long this war lasts.  Will it last a year?  Will it last five years?  We do not know.  We hope it will be finished tomorrow.  We wish it never started, but it did.  This country, the European Union and the international community have to assist by doing all that they can.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senators Hoey and Flynn also referenced International Women's Day, as well as the issues surrounding Travellers and the Traveller movement, such as their lower life expectancy and higher rates of suicide.  Senator Flynn spoke of the National Travellers Women's Forum and how they want a brighter future for their children.  Of course, we all want brighter futures for all of our children here in this country and across the world as well.  Senator Flynn referenced accommodation.  The budget for the past two years has been spent in our local authorities, according to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, which is important because it was not being spent.  <\/p><p>Senator Dooley talked of his trip.  <\/p><p>Senator Buttimer talked again of Ukraine and standing in solidarity and the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte that will no doubt be shown to Ukrainians, some of whom already have arrived, as well as those who will arrive in the future.  I imagine that the St. Patrick's Day parades across the country will reference support for Ukrainian citizens.  I can imagine the flags will be flying in our St. Patrick's Day parades as an act of solidarity and no doubt that will happen organically.  Senator Buttimer also talked about the rise in fuel costs, which is something that is very much a concern.  Some of it is relating to the international instability over the past number of weeks but it is something that is becoming more of an issue.  I will certainly ask for a debate on that.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan first expressed the hope that we can all support the coffee morning tomorrow morning in the Members' private dining room at 10 a.m.  We will do our best to be there.  It is held in support of the situation in Ukraine and there will be ambassadors from around the world attending.  She asked for a debate on public liability and certainly that was the view, namely, that we were going to have a fall in premiums if the amount of payouts fell.  That certainly is what we were being told, that if the payouts are reduced, the premiums will fall.  Where that is not happening, it should be the case.  Therefore, we will ask for a follow-up with the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, on that.  IPB Insurance, the Irish public bodies mutual insurers, does a tremendous job in relation to our local authorities and if it can expand its cover, it would certainly be beneficial to community groups.  I can certainly suggest that to it and I urge the Senator to contact them as well with the representative from her native county and any other county.<\/p><p>Senator Hackett talked of International Women's Day as well and noted women in the midlands.<\/p><p>Senators Ahearn and Maria Byrne talked of the N24 road, among a number of other things.  I would like to again compliment the Minster, Deputy Eamon Ryan on agreeing that where there was, if you like, sterilisation of land, because a number of routes were chosen for roads, for example, in the N24 and the Mullingar-Longford area as well, that they would be allowed to continue the process to get to preferred route stage.  That would reduce the level of land sterilisation and from there, one can go to the next stage of planning and design.  Therefore, it is important those steps are continually taken.  I would like to welcome that announcement from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and compliment Senator Ahearn, in particular, on his advocacy on that.  He also mentioned Councillor Marie Murphy in Tipperary, the cathaoirleach of the first citizens forum in the region.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne also asked for a discussion on agency staff and the costs for carers.  Clearly, carers do much travelling and driving.  They have to be able to drive to be able to get from Mrs. Murphy's house to Mrs. Keener's house or whatever and they are driving up byroads going up beside those places.  They cannot be expected to rely on public transport in rural areas .  Therefore, it is required that you drive your car.  Where that is costing money because of increased fuel prices, there needs to be recognition of that.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan talked of the &euro;200 energy rebate, which is due to be taken off people's bills.  She talked of the issues in relation to the committee.  I will ask that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan be contacted.  He will have to decide whether the record needs to be corrected or not.  I am not aware of what he said in particular.  However, I know the reason there was a universal scheme was to ensure that there was speedy enactment and provision of funds.  If we had to go through a more prolonged period of legislation to determine who was eligible or not and how that would be enforced and the administration of that, it would take longer and would be possibly more costly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I welcome that the credit has been issued.  I will contact him on where that funding is coming from.  <\/p><p>Senator Currie spoke about an issue that is very close to my heart, namely, community centres.  I have long advocated that as things stand, there is no community centre fund to which people wishing to construct a new community centre can apply.  As the Senator will know, &euro;5 million was allocated in last year's budget for the maintenance or upgrade of existing community centres but I am not aware that any scheme in that regard has been launched.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will be able to provide information in terms of her plans to roll out that scheme.  The Senator mentioned that that scheme should be open not only to local authorities but community centres in the ownership of the church and other groups.  The latter would have to be eligible because if there are fire safety or other issues, they need to be rectified.  I would advise the Senator to engage on the matter with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, by way of Commencement matter.<\/p><p>In my view, there is an absolute necessity for a community centre fund for growing and newly-established communities.  The cost of building a community centre from scratch are astronomical.  It costs up to &euro;7 million to build one to specification, depending on size, with new modern day standards, building regulations and so on.  There needs to be a dedicated fund for growing communities throughout the country.  <\/p><p>Senator Ward raised the issue of water sports and sailing.  Again, the Senator might consider raising a Commencement matter on the issue because it is quite specific or he might request a meeting directly with the Minister.  There are a number of sports in which we could encourage more participation subject to funding, equipment and volunteers.  I have no doubt there are greater possibilities within sailing.  I encourage Senator Ward to engage with the Minister and the Department to see what additional opportunities might be made available to encourage sailing across the country.<\/p><p>I reaffirm my support for International Women's Day, which was the main focus of contribution today, and solidarity to all those who are fleeing the atrocities in Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#Y00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646749800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Data Protection Act 2018 (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations 2022: Motion","time":1646749800,"counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#BB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:   \tData Protection Act 2018 (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations 2022,  a copy of which has been laid in draft form before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 2nd March, 2022.&quot; <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#BB00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646749800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Technological Universities Act 2018 (Section 26) (Appointed Day) (No. 2) Order 2022: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1646749800,"counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#BB00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the proposal that Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:   \tTechnological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) (No. 2) Order 2022,  copies of which have been laid in draft form before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 23rd February, 2022, be referred to the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, in accordance with Standing Order 71(2)(<i>b<\/i>), which, not later than 29th March, 2022, shall send a message to the Seanad in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 75, and Standing Order 77(2) shall accordingly apply. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#BB00700","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646749800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021: Report and Final Stages","time":1646749800,"counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#CC00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>This debate is to adjourn at 6.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#CC00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>We will be done in 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#CC00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>That should suffice, but just in case.

The amendments we have submitted today on Report Stage that have made it onto the Order Paper all deal with the same issue, which is substituting the words \"an Irish\" for \"a European\".  This again goes back to the idea of discrimination and why Irish fisher men and women would be treated differently to their European counterparts.  We already know that they are competing with super trawlers, and that they come under their quotas, which are less than what they should be.  The very minimum we can do is ensure that they are on an equal footing when it comes to this penalty points system, and that it would be the same system for all European fisher men and women, as opposed to just Irish fisher men and women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#CC03100","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State respond to the entire grouping of amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#DD00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Yes I will take those amendments as grouped.  The effects of these amendments taken together appears to be to expand the scope of the points system for masters provided for under the Bill currently, to encompass masters who are citizens of another member state, as distinct from Irish citizens.<\/p><p>The amendments would require, in effect, that the Minister would have to set up a register to cover all masters from all EU member states and that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority would have to assign points to masters who are citizens of other member states.<\/p><p>In this regard, it should be noted that the Bill provides in sum, that points assigned to a master who is a national of another member state shall be notified to the competent authority of that member state.  The notification to the competent authority shall include the following particulars as per section 15I(4):<\/p> <blockquote> \t(a) the identity of the sea-fishing boat to which the infringement concerned relates;<br \/><br \/>(b) the name and address of, and any other identifying details available relating to, the master of the sea-fishing boat;<br \/><br \/>(c) the particulars of the serious infringement concerned;<br \/><br \/>(d) the number of points applicable to that infringement.  <\/blockquote> <p>Senators should also note that under the Bill, the same determination procedure applies regardless of whether the master concerned is an Irish citizen or a national of another member state.  In each case, the independent determination panel and the independent appeals officer, where relevant, determine whether a serious infringement has occurred for which points should apply.  In each case, the master concerned may apply to the High Court on a point of law regarding a decision of the appeals officer.  It is only when this determination procedure has concluded that differing procedural requirements apply regarding the assignment of points, depending on whether the master concerned is an Irish citizen or a national of another member state.<\/p><p>I should also point out that a similar approach to that I have just outlined is taken in the context of the separate points system for licence holders, as provided for here under the European Union Common Fisheries Policy points systems regulations.  That licence holder system has been operational in Ireland since January 2021.  Senators will recall from the debate on Second Stage that more generally the scheme for masters' points now proposed in the Bill follows, insofar as possible, the provisions of the existing separate licence holder system, with regard to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the list of serious infringements, the number of points assigned, and the suspension thresholds as provided for under the EU regulations, and in certain other respects too.<\/p><p>In my view, the relevant procedures in the Bill as I have just summarised, are the most appropriate means of ensuring the effectiveness of the masters' points system.  Were these amendments acceded to I believe the result would be seen as contrary to the intent of the EU objective.  Masters who are nationals of other member states could have points assigned to them by the Irish authorities, but then shortly thereafter could potentially have points assigned to them by the competent authorities of other member states.  A master could conceivably accumulate points in multiple member states, each operating separately, without ever reaching the relevant threshold for suspension or disqualification.  The EU points system for masters could not function in an effective, proportionate and dissuasive manner if multiple member states assigned points to respective masters who are nationals of other member states.  This is the clear implication of these amendments, and such an outcome would, in my view, undermine the effectiveness of the system, both at national and EU levels.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Bill follows the approach set down in the EU control regulation in respect of licenceholders by providing for each member state to assign points in respect of its licenceholders and for masters who are its citizens.

I am glad to be here to focus on, discuss and introduce the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill 2022 to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is a short but important piece of legislation in response to the Covid-19 situation.<\/p> <p>Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March 2020, the Government has sought to protect as many businesses, jobs and workers as possible through the early introduction of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and its longer-term successor, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  This was followed by many targeted measures for businesses, which have been critical in keeping them afloat and preventing redundancies over the last two years.<\/p> <p>Many sectors are yet again rebounding relatively quickly since the lifting of restrictions.  This is a real tribute to the resilience of businesses and employees.  We have good reason to be optimistic but a uniform and smooth recovery is not guaranteed and, regrettably, some redundancies will probably arise, which brings me to the objective of this Bill.<\/p> <p>This Bill will resolve an issue arising for employees who were laid off for periods because of the necessary Covid-19 public health restrictions and who were subsequently made redundant.  The Bill will ensure that a worker who was laid off due to Covid-19 restrictions is not further disadvantaged.  On being made redundant, that person will receive the same statutory redundancy entitlement as though he or she had not been laid off due to Covid-19 restrictions.<\/p> <p>Under existing redundancy provisions, a period of lay-off within the final three years of service before a worker is made redundant is not allowable as reckonable service.  Therefore, that lay-off period is not counted towards a worker&rsquo;s statutory redundancy payment.  As a result of the necessary Government decisions to close and restrict certain sectors of our economy, some workers lost the opportunity to accrue reckonable service.  This Bill will provide for a Covid-19 related lay-off payment from the State, which, in the event of the worker&rsquo;s redundancy, will cover lay-off periods due to Covid-19 restrictions. <\/p> <p>During the debate on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, some members queried why lay-off periods beyond 30 September were not being covered by the Covid-19 related lay-off payment.  At the time, that was because of the link made between the payment and the emergency period covered by the section 12A suspension of a worker&rsquo;s right to trigger a redundancy.<\/p> <p>It was the right approach when the policy was approved and brought through Cabinet.  We listened to Deputies on the Second Stage and Committee Stage discussions, however, and agreed that the arrival of the Omicron variant and new restrictions demanded further consideration to increase the timelines.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, we proposed an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage, which was agreed to, extending the period covered out to 31 January 2022.  This new period covers the additional restrictions that were in place until 22 January and allows some additional lead-in time during which the most affected businesses may have been preparing to reopen fully.  For completeness, I should also mention that I also tabled an amendment to correct a minor cross-referencing error in the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021 on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>I will turn back to the substance of the Bill, again, to clarify who qualifies for this payment.  A worker does not have to have been in receipt of any form of State payment during the lay-off period.  The criteria are simply that the person qualifies for redundancy in the usual way, was laid off because of Covid-19 restrictions and was made redundant within three years of those restrictions ending.<\/p> <p>The amount an eligible worker will receive will depend on the length of time he or she was placed on lay-off due to Covid-19 before the date they were made redundant.  The Bill does not change the fact that the employers are obliged to pay statutory redundancy to eligible workers, which excludes lay-off periods, in the final three years of employment.  Employers will not be liable for this additional payment, however.  The Covid-19 restrictions that resulted in lay-offs were completely outside the employers' control.  Imposing this cost on employers would, therefore, be unfair.  It would also conflict with wider Government policy, which since the start of the pandemic has been to minimise financial hardship for businesses and their workers during the most challenging of times.<\/p> <p>This Bill provides the best outcome for both employers and employees.  It will provide the legislative basis for the Department of Social Protection to process applications and make this payment to workers.  It will be an employer-led online application process in the first instances.  This is the most efficient approach from a customer service perspective.  In the event that an employer fails to make an application, however, I assure Members that manual applications from workers will be accepted and they will not lose out.<\/p> <p>Intensive work is ongoing on the development of the necessary systems.  Officials in the Department of Social Protection expect to open the application process during quarter 2 of this year.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, all the officials and her team for their important work in facilitating this.<\/p> <p>This Bill will improve the entitlements of workers without imposing additional costs on employers.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#PP00400","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much.

The work the Minister of State's Department has done has been greatly appreciated and acknowledged from an employer and employee perspective.<\/p> <p>This is an element of something that happens after the fact of Covid-19, which we acknowledge needs to be rectified.  As the Minister of State said, it is an important Bill.  It is short, obviously, but it is still important.  We as a Government have been there to support employees and businesses, whether it is through the EWSS, PUP, Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, or the range of payments that have been there for businesses throughout the past two years.  We also need to be there to support the businesses and employees on technical matters like this.<\/p> <p>This will obviously support the payment of employees if they receive redundancy payments over the next three years if they lose their jobs.  It looks at the time period for which they were out of work through Covid-19.  That is really important to recognise.

We are doing this for those who were out of work for a specific period of time, essentially March 2020 up to last month.  If I am correct, the cost per person is just over &euro;2,000.  While it is not a significant amount of money that the State has to put aside for people who might possibly lose their jobs over the next three years but it is an important element to recognise that this particular time when they were out of work would not have been the case under normal circumstances.  It is important their redundancy payments reflect that.  <\/p><p>As I said, this is really important.  It is a necessary measure.  Hopefully, there will not be too many people affected but for those who are, the State is here to support them.  The Minister of State will be aware that businesses have had it very difficult over the past two years.  In light of what is happening now in Europe, it is not going to be easy for businesses going forward either.  For some, it could be even more difficult.  The price of heating has increased to &euro;1.40.  On my way here today from Tipperary I pulled into a service station in Laois to get diesel, where the cost per litre is &euro;2.04.  There are people who monitor diesel prices all of the time, as I do, but I do not think I have ever been as shocked by an increase as I was today.  When I was paying, I asked the employee at the counter if many of the people coming into the shop were expressing shock at the price they are paying for diesel at the moment and she said, \"Yes\".  Her next response was, \"We're actually putting up again tonight\".  It has almost never been done before, but the State needs to intervene in some capacity to support businesses.<\/p><p>Over the weekend, I had an engagement with a haulage company where I heard it would pay hauliers not to deliver the services and the goods they have committed to in contracts agreed previously.  They have sought to revise prices with the companies to reflect the increase of the cost of petrol and diesel and while some companies understand and are agreeing revisions, others have refused and are sticking to what was agreed.  The haulage companies would be better off just not delivering but they will not do that.  They are, however, under immense pressure.<\/p><p>Where I come from in Tipperary many people have only recently returned to work post Covid.  Many of them, as the Minister of State will know because he recently visited the area, are people who have to travel to work in places such as Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  The State is crediting people &euro;200 for energy bills.  There are people in my town in Clonmel and in Tipperary whose travel costs per week have increased by &euro;100.  Before the Covid pandemic, they had to put only &euro;100 per week of diesel into the tank to get to and from Cork over five days.  The cost in that regard now is &euro;200.  We speak often about the increases in the cost of many things but this is beyond manageable for employees who need to travel to work and for employers as well.  I know I am straying from the Bill but the current cost of fuel is unusual.  The Minister of State and the Government need to support business through this difficult time.  There is immense worry about where this is going to go and where it is going to end.  <\/p><p>I welcome this Bill.  It is really important.  It is another acknowledgement that we get it that people need to be supported not only during the pandemic but post pandemic.  There are long-term issues that remain to be resolved.  I am happy to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#PP00600","speaker":"1629","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  As stated by Senator Ahearn, everybody in the House is supportive of the Bill.  As it progressed through the D&aacute;il, equally there was support for it there.  It is logical, common-sense legislation that is to be welcomed.  However, I want to speak a little about the pandemic and the Government's approach to it.  The Government has tried to facilitate everybody, from the employer down to the employee.  It sought to ensure that those who lost their jobs were looked after through the PUP and it incentivised businesses through the EWSS to keep their employees in the workplace rather than making them redundant.<\/p> <p>In his opening remarks, the Minister of State spoke about the resilience of businesses.  That resilience was based on what Government did for businesses.  It allowed businesses to survive.  It gave them the tools to enable them to get through the two years of the pandemic.  In terms of my own industry - I am not afraid to put this on the record - but for the Government supports our businesses would have closed.  The EWSS enabled us to maintain ten of our 40 full-time staff for the full two years of the pandemic.  Had that scheme not be put in place, those staff would have been laid off.  Sadly, many people returned to their homes and they do not propose to return and so we are once again experiencing a skills shortage.<\/p> <p>I welcome the two changes to take account of the Omicron variant, that is, the increase in the rate and the extension of the redundancy period up to January 2025.  We do not yet know the full impact of the past two years on the viability of businesses going forward.  A significant number of businesses have borrowed over the past two years.  That borrowing now has to be repaid.  Worryingly, over &euro;3 billion was lodged in the tax warehousing scheme by small businesses.  Those businesses now have to pay that back.  That will be the struggle.  <\/p> <p>You could not have written the script.  After coming out of Covid, before we know it we are into a war situation that is again testing the viability of businesses.  Senator Ahearn mentioned the haulage business.  I engaged with five hauliers yesterday.  Senator Ahearn is correct that many of them are saying that one more hike in the price of diesel will park them up.  The margins are getting tighter and tighter.  An increase of approximately &euro;1 in the cost of diesel will have a significant impact on that margin.  Diesel costs would normally be a 30% cost for that business.  It is now between 50% and 60% of the business.  It is no longer viable for them.  The Government will have to step in, whether through the diesel rebate scheme or a reduction in excise duty, which I understand is currently being considered.  When transport costs increase all costs increase.  We all need deliveries, be that the delivery of food, oil and so on.  It is a cost that we all have to bear.  I ask the Minister of State to take that back to those making the decisions.  According to the hauliers, this needs to be done sooner rather than later.  Every day we wait, business becomes less worthwhile for the haulage industry.  Some will try to get out of contracts but others may just park up.<\/p> <p>Everybody in the House welcomes this Bill.  As I said, the Government has taken a common-sense, logical approach in terms of protecting the employee and the employer.  I welcome the Bill and I look forward to its speedy passage through the House.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#QQ00200","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English.  My apologies for not being here for his earlier contribution.  I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Senator Gavan, who has asked me to pass on his apologies for not being here.<\/p> <p>The Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill 2022 is a response to the decision taken at the beginning of the pandemic whereby section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 was suspended.  This was at a time when thousands of people suddenly found themselves out of work and when life as we knew it shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was a terrible shock and a traumatic time for those affected by job losses and for so many small business owners who had to close their doors.  The decision taken to suspend section 12A at that time was taken to protect workers from being made redundant.  Employers were also protected so that they would not be inundated with workers applying for redundancy payments.  However, because of the decision, several technical difficulties arose for workers who were laid off or on short time and for those in receipt of the PUP.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It raised serious concerns that they would not have the fair calculation of reckonable service if they were made redundant and as a result they might then lose out on significant sums of money regarding a redundancy claim.  In response to these concerns, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill last March, the Redundancy Payments (Lay off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill 2021, the aim of which was similar to that of the Bill before the House this evening, namely, to ensure workers would not lose out on time when it came to the calculation of a redundancy entitlement.  The Bill before us is quite similar and it is very welcome.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill went a bit further as it sought to clarify some workers' rights issues that had arisen.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Teachta O'Reilly, tried to make amendments on Committee Stage but unfortunately they were ruled out of order.  However, we will continue to support the Bill because of the importance of what it does achieve despite what it does not.  <\/p><p>The Bill provides for a once-off redundancy payment to workers in respect of certain lay-off periods, during the period beginning on 13 March and ending at the end of September 2021.  Under the Redundancy Payments Act, statutory redundancy is based on duration of service and a qualified employee is entitled to two weeks' pay per year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a cap of &euro;600 in earnings per week, payable by the employer.  Under the existing Act, periods of lay-off in the final three years of service do not count as reckonable service, meaning that redundancy entitlements will not factor in those periods.  Therefore that would result in a loss in relation to redundancy payments.  Thankfully, that is addressed within the Bill.  It ensures affected workers can access a tax-free State payment of up to &euro;1,860 financed by the Social Insurance Fund to compensate for the break in their service caused by the pandemic and associated public-health restrictions.  <\/p><p>It would be good to hear from the Minister of State at this point on whether there are more details about the operational and practical side of delivering the scheme and rolling it out.  There will be people anxiously waiting to find out how and when they can apply.  We want to work with the Minister of State to get this legislation over the line as efficiently and effectively as possible but it is important that the details of how the scheme will be delivered are explained for people.  We do not want to see a situation where the scheme sits between two Ministers with neither really taking full responsibility, because it is not clear whether responsibility will be directly upon the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or upon the Minister for Social Protection.  Will the Minister of State clarify at this stage whether the application will be online or paper-based and how it will work in practice?  The details on that would be very helpful.  <\/p><p>I want to make a point about what the Bill does not achieve, and I want to finish by raising the issue of tactical insolvency.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, was very accommodating at the Committee on Enterprise, Trade, and Employment when discussing this matter with my colleague, Teachta O'Reilly.  However, I want to read into the Official Report of the Seanad the need for legislation to deal with tactical insolvencies, which have the result of destroying workers' collective redundancy entitlements.  We saw it with Clerys, La Senza, Paris Bakery, TalkTalk, and Debenhams how tactical and other opaque insolvencies can ruin workers' collective redundancy entitlements and damage public finances.  This legislation recognises the fact that, through no fault of their own, workers found themselves on lay-off and they should not find themselves disproportionately impacted by something that was not their fault.  Likewise in the situation of a tactical insolvency, workers who have given good and loyal service find themselves in a situation whereby the company goes out of business and they are left with absolutely nothing.  The majority of companies do not engage in this practice but legislation is required for those that do.  They are only small in number and I would not want to portray this as a case of all workers being in danger of this happening to them.  However, when it happens it is absolutely devastating.  The Minister of State gave a detailed outline of where things currently stand with Government legislation to correct the lacuna in the law which is exploited by companies engaging in tactical and opaque insolvencies and I thank him for that.  We all want to work together to resolve this matter, and I know the Committee on Enterprise, Trade, and Employment will be looking at it further.  I hope this House, the D&aacute;il, the committee and the Ministers can work together to ensure that what happened to the workers at Clerys, La Senza, Paris Bakery, TalkTalk, and Debenhams never happens again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#QQ00300","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>First, I must offer my apologies.  As it is International Women's Day, I am scooting from one Zoom event to another today.  It is a big day for us gals.  I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.  The Labour Party of course supports this Bill.  It will bring peace of mind to many workers who were laid off during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.  During the past two years, our society made many large changes for the greater good of public health.  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 gave legislative effect to many of these changes.  This groundbreaking emergency legislation was rightly introduced at great speed and it is perhaps to be expected that such a wide-ranging and fast-moving Act was not going to be perfect.  Indeed, issues around the Act's medium and long-term effect on workers' access to fair redundancy were raised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and by the Labour Party at the time.  My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has referenced other parties and Members of both Houses who raised concerns with this.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, in particular was highly vocal about the real risk to workers in the manner in which the section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act was suspended.  While the State's plan for emergency support payments required the suspension of normal redundancy rules in order to prevent widespread job losses during lockdown, the Act left many workers badly exposed against the risk of future redundancy.  Without the measures in this Bill, workers made redundant from 2024 onwards would find themselves unable to count any time they spent on the pandemic unemployment payment towards a fair calculation of their redundancy entitlement.  In other words, workers who were temporarily laid off during the pandemic and who later unfortunately are made redundant, will find that some or all of their time employed during 2020 and 2021 will not count towards their redundancy claim.  The financial cost to these workers would have been significant.  Workers who did the right thing in taking the pandemic unemployment payment, doing their part to keep their employers and our economy afloat would have found themselves out of pocket at the worst possible time.  Obviously it is extremely welcome that this problem is now being corrected and that workers seeking to access their redundancy rights will now be able to get a fair accounting of their employment during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>By passing this short Bill we are restoring vital supports for workers who, it is to be hoped, will never need to access them.  I repeat that this is welcome but I also repeat that this problem we are now correcting was identified by the Labour Party, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others at the time it was being created.  An amendment was tabled by Deputy Nash which would have corrected this issue before it even began.  That amendment was ultimately withdrawn in the interests of speedy passage of the emergency legislation, with reassurances from the Government that this issue would be fixed in time.  Time has passed, it is now being fixed but perhaps we could reflect on the fact that had the Labour amendment been accepted back in 2020, we could have had really strong emergency legislation without the need for this corrective measure two years later.  Ultimately I do not believe there was any need to leave workers who had been laid off during the pandemic with uncertainty hanging over their heads.  There was very much uncertainty outside of this uncertainty hanging over workers' heads.  Of course it is good to see this uncertainty removed and we will be supporting this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#RR00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation.  It is a very short Bill and I am delighted that the Minister has brought it forward.  It gives certainty to people who were laid off or are going to be laid off up to 2025 in some cases.  It provides for their statutory redundancy.  In the overall context, in my view it still does not address the whole issue of redundancy, in particular for self-employed people and sole traders.  I have repeatedly made this point in this House.  I have drafted a Private Members' Bill which I will bring forward in the next couple of weeks.  A highly unfair imposition is put on self-employed people and sole traders who employ people and who start out employing people in the greatest of faith.  They are fully committed to their businesses and for some reason or other the business may fail, close down or they may want to retire.  There is no system whereby the employer can make provision for a business that may fail or close.  At the end of the day when the business closes, the employer has to find two weeks' pay per year for the staff members who were employed for maybe ten or 20 years, I think there is a limit on the number of years that can be counted.  If the employer cannot pay it, of course the State will pay but eventually the State will come after the employer.  That means that a charge can be put on the family home.  The Bill that I am bringing forward will be to eliminate the risk to the family home from statutory redundancy, in particular in the case of self-employed people and sole traders who are employing a small number of people and who do not have the same protection as companies that are protected.<\/p> <p>In the long run, the Government must find some system where this is paid.  It is only right that employees would be paid and paid properly and so on but some provision has to be made.  At the end of the day, somebody who employs people for 20 or 30 years can have a charge put on the family home.  There could well be a dependent child in the house for whom the family would like to make provision for when they die but the charge is put on the family home.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have employed people, paid their taxes, paid for the Civil Service and so on.  It is an awful imposition to put on people who do not have the protection of a company.  They start up a business in good faith and hope that it will grow and grow.  They never contemplate a day when their business will fail, but businesses do fail in lots of cases.  Indeed, in this particular climate, there will be many businesses that will fail.  There will be businesspeople between now and 2025 who will have no choice but to give up, who will determine that they cannot continue because they are getting too old, that the business is not making money or that it is no longer viable.  Those people, unless they have the protection of a company, will have no choice but to make redundancy payments to their staff.  Under this Bill, the Government is making provision for a number of years.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to look favourably on the Bill that I will be bringing forward.  In the long run, there must be some system whereby employers can contribute to a fund that would cover those eventualities.  Even if employers choose to put a certain amount of money away, it is taxed.  If they put away a week's wages for some of the staff, they have to pay tax on it.  They cannot offset it or make any provision.  A businessman I know had to cash in all of his private pension in order to cover redundancy payments.  Even that did not cover him and now there is a charge on his family home.  I have spoken to various Ministers about this.  They have the greatest sympathy for this person and for others in similar circumstances, but that is not much good.<\/p><p>I welcome this Bill and the provisions it contains.

I will tease through some of the issues that were raised.<\/p> <p>I understand that Senator Hoey had to leave to attend an International Women's Day event.  Today is an important day and we are all very supportive of it.  On International Women's Day, I am glad to give a shout out to all of the women involved in our country and beyond and to acknowledge all they do to contribute to society, business and job creation.  On that note, I am delighted to see that there is more of a gender balance among those who own and run companies and among employers right throughout the system, including on boards of directors.  We all gain when there is a better gender balance, whether that is in politics, business, communities or families.  I am delighted, from a business point of view, to see greater involvement of women in decision-making.  That is something we can build on and it is something the T&aacute;naiste is very keen to develop even further.<\/p> <p>On the Bill, I thank Senators for their considered thoughts on it and for their support.  As I said in my opening remarks, the intention is to have this system up and running in quarter 2 of this year.  The payment system will be run by the Department of Social Protection.  This legislation has been brought forward by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection.  A great deal of work has been done over the past year or two by both Departments in order to make sure we get this right.  I acknowledged in the D&aacute;il and at committee but forgot to mention it here that there was support from all political parties over the past two years for this to happen.  We said very clearly that this would happen.  It was announced and confirmed by Cabinet in August 2021.  People should not have had any anxiety about it because we have always said clearly that, in conjunction with the unions, this would be addressed at the appropriate time.  The appropriate time to address and confirm it was before section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act was lifted last October.  That was dealt with, and the system will be up and running soon.<\/p> <p>Some technical advancements had to be made in the Department of Social Protection over the past few months to get this right.  The Department is working on its systems, and this should be up and running hopefully in the first half of quarter 2.  That is what we are going to try to do.  It will be online and employer-led but there will be situations where the employer is no longer around or may not want to be involved.  We will ensure that every employee is looked after so if an employer does not lead with the online application, we will deal with paper transactions for employees.  In that way, everybody will be captured and nobody will be left out.  People will not fall between two stools.  Those days are gone thanks to joined up thinking across all Departments.  There has been great co-operation between the two relevant Departments on this legislation.<\/p> <p>Senator Ahearn asked what the maximum payment would be in rough terms.  If someone was laid off for the whole period of the Covid restrictions, the maximum payment would be approximately &euro;2,268 so the Senator's estimate of &euro;2,000 was nearly right.  Thankfully, the majority are not in that situation.  The majority were at work for some periods during the restrictions and, hopefully, even those people who were laid off for all of that time will not be made redundant.  As Senator Casey said, however, we do not know the full fallout from Covid yet or what will happen to those companies.  Senator Burke made that point too.  This legislation is pre-empting situations that might arise over the next three years.  It is important and timely.  As Senator Casey said, it is common sense and logical to try to be ready for scenarios that might arise while hoping that they do not.  The Department of Social Protection will operate this as a Covid-19-related lay-off payment.  We will update the House when the process is up and running.<\/p> <p>Another issue that was raised was the development of solutions in the context of informal insolvency.  Again, to be clear, there is already legislation in place for this.  It is not often referred to in the Houses and it is not often used.  When we sat down with the Debenham's workers we agreed that we would try to strengthen the legislation that is in place.  The T&aacute;naiste was very clear about that when we met them first, along with their union, Mandate.  We went through all of this with them and said we would review the situation to see if we could strengthen the law in this area.  It was not appropriate to bring forward any changes in this legislation.  Some of the changes required will involve other legislation.  Consultations have been ongoing with trade union and business representative bodies, and there have also been discussions in these Houses, around deficiencies in company and employment law and changes that could be made to improve the position of employees who find themselves in a redundancy situation due to company insolvency.  Following that engagement, the Government's plan for action on collective redundancy following insolvency was published last year.<\/p> <p>I am happy to provide an update to the House now.  On company law, the Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021, which was discussed in the Seanad, amended the Companies Act to enhance the provision of information to employees as creditors.  Employees were not always kept up to date in terms of the information to which they were entitled so that has now changed.  The company law review group presented its report on the consequences of certain corporate liquidations and restructuring practices, including the splitting of corporate operations from asset-holding entities in group structures to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State, Deputy Troy, in December 2021.  This work reflects complex policy issues and the Department is currently examining the recommendations made in the context of the plan for action.  The Government will provide for any necessary further amendments to the Companies Act and will do so in a way that does not unduly impede enterprises in the conduct of their business.  That report will be published, along with the recommendations from the Department on it, very soon.<\/p> <p>I am not going to name any companies but some situations have been name-checked in here and in D&aacute;il debates which are not correctly in that category.  There are very big differences with some of these situations but we will strengthen the legislation in general.  I am not going to reopen the whole debate, but there has been some misinformation on this that is not backed up by evidence.  I have repeatedly asked for that evidence in both Houses.  Again, I would ask those who constantly make claims that if they have information that the Department does not have, please bring it forward and we will act on it.  It is not right to keep making assertions without backing them up.  That is all I would say, particularly as the courts have a different view to that of members of these Houses.  Misinformation does not help when we are trying to bring forward legislation to deal with these situations.  Regarding the situation with a particular company last year, I would say that people were given misinformation and led in the wrong direction by some politicians.  That resulted in a lot of unnecessary hardship for people who were led down a path that delayed them in moving on with their careers.  People were not always well served.  We should deal with the facts and the evidence as best we can.<\/p> <p>On changes to employment law that are recommended, an information handbook was published in December 2021 which provides clear and accessible information on the rights and remedies available to employees facing a collective redundancy situation following a company insolvency.  That handbook helps people to navigate the system with clear, concise information on their entitlements.  The drafting of the heads of a Bill amending the Protection of Employment Act 1977 has commenced and that Bill we be brought before the Houses very soon.  Work has also commenced on the drafting of the terms of reference for the employment law review group and on organising suitable membership of same.  Our immediate focus is to get this group up and running, initially on a non-statutory basis, in quarter 1 of this year, and the T&aacute;naiste will be announcing that quite soon.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That group will be placed on a statutory footing as soon as possible thereafter.  We are progressing with our commitment to strengthen the legislation in that area.  We recognise the difficulties for anybody who ends up in a redundancy situation.  It is not one that workers want to be in and, as Senator Burke referenced, it is not one that their employers want to be in.  Most people start and grow a business with the full potential to serve an area and to provide a service or an asset, or to deliver or make some goods, but part of that involves the creation of jobs.  They take that role very seriously.  That is certainly the case with all the Irish-owned companies that we work with on a daily basis through our development agencies.  They are very much committed to their staff.  While they never want to be in a redundancy situation, it can happen and we must protect everybody as best we possibly can in that situation.<\/p><p>I look forward to Senator Burke's Bill coming forward and to having a conversation with him because he has identified an area that we all recognise.  There are a lot of small businesses out there who are under immense pressure to try to find finance to meet everyone's entitlements if a situation goes wrong.  There is legislation to protect employees with statutory entitlements but very often an employer is left with one asset and that must be sold in order to pay the redundancies.  I am not aware of too many situations where a family home is pursued by the Department of Social Protection for the Social Insurance Fund.  It is my understanding that it is generally avoided, but I will check that.  It is something we can discuss and clarify as well during the debate on the Senator's Bill.  None of us would like to see that happening, whatever about other assets.  There are companies that are in other situations.  The Department of Social Protection works with employers to avoid undue duress on anybody and it tries to find a payment mechanism to make it a bit easier for companies as well in a redundancy situation.<\/p><p>It was correctly identified earlier by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile that section 12A was there to protect jobs, businesses and workers.  In some situations, if redundancies are triggered too early, it could put jobs in jeopardy.  Likewise, when redundancy payments are due, there is a recognition by Departments that some companies need to be assisted in that regard in the early stages to save other jobs and they can pay it back over time.  There are mechanisms in the Department of Social Protection to allow for assistance with statutory payments and for the money to be paid back over time.  Efforts are made to work out a payment plan that suits to keep a business afloat and protect the jobs that are still there as well.  We can discuss that further when Senator Burke brings forward the Bill but I am happy to work with him on it and to see if we can improve the situation.  At the end of the day, we are trying to encourage more people to create jobs.  We want to have jobs.  All the signs are very positive in respect to the recovery from Covid, but that is because employers take a risk and give people jobs in the first place.  I hope people will start companies and do all that.  We try to be as employer-friendly as we possibly can, while also protecting workers, which is key.  It is important to get the balance right.  In most situations, as a country we get the balance right but we need to build on it as well.<\/p><p>That leads me to the points Senators Ahearn and Casey referenced.  We have come through Covid, and companies have shown great resilience.  They were assisted with the support of taxpayers through Government initiatives.  That is key.  Everyone gained from that.  We still have a functioning economy.  Thankfully, a lot of people are going back to work now or are back in work but there is more pressure on the system because although we have come through Covid, due to the war in Ukraine there is significant pressure on costs, especially energy costs, as Senator Ahearn mentioned.  He referred to someone driving from Clonmel to work.  Naturally, we want to keep all the people in Tipperary working in Clonmel and other parts of the county, but the reality is that people commute.  It is now standard that a bill for fuel of &euro;100 for people who must travel from Clonmel or Navan elsewhere to work, has doubled to &euro;200.  There is immense pressure on family income as well.  The Government will be bringing forward initiatives to address that.  It has done so already, but a lot has changed in the past ten to 14 days.  More initiatives will be announced by the Government.  That is also putting immense pressure on businesses.  Senators Ahearn and Casey and others have raised that in the debate.  Without doubt, there is so much pressure in the transport, distribution and logistics sector that it has a knock-on effect on any product or service that is for sale.  The situation is being monitored and tracked by the Government, in conjunction with packages from the EU, to see how we can respond.  Without a doubt, there will have to be additional supports.  The economy is going to go through a difficult time with pressure on costs as a knock-on effect of all the sanctions and the consequences of what is happening in Ukraine.  We are doing the right thing as a country to support the people of Ukraine as best we possibly can.  We are doing all we can to help them by opening up our own borders, but it will have a knock-on effect on the economy and families and businesses will need assistance to get through this, and they will get it from the Government.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have been talking about this recently and they will be bringing more initiatives forward in the coming days and weeks.<\/p><p>I have covered most of the issues raised.  I will take a quick look to see if I have missed anything.  It was correctly flagged by many people at the time that legislation would be coming through but now is the right time to do it and it will be in place for anybody who needs redundancy in the weeks ahead as well.  If I missed anything, I will clarify it later.  I thank Senators for supporting the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#SS00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646749800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#TT00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022030800002#TT00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1646749800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
