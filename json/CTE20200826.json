I am joined by my colleagues from the HSE, Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer, and Ms Niamh O'Beirne, lead on testing and tracing.<\/p> <p>  Over the past few recent months, we have been focused on restoring various aspects of our health services that had to be suspended in the early phases of Covid-19.  We have also been finalising plans to protect our patients, the public and our staff this coming winter and throughout 2021.  As we have recently seen, we need continuously to assess these plans as we experience increased numbers of cases of the virus, major outbreaks and a requirement for significant serial testing, along with increased demands on testing and tracing.  In the past 14 days, there have been 1,269 confirmed cases.  For context, the equivalent number for the same two weeks in July was 264.<\/p> <p>  In respect of testing and contact tracing, the committee has requested specific engagement on the State's response to the recent spike in Covid-19 cases.  In the past two weeks, we have triggered our resourcing escalation plan for testing and tracing.  Serial testing is ongoing in meat and food processing plants and we have reintroduced serial testing programmes in nursing homes and long-term care settings for older people.<\/p> <p>  I wish to inform the committee of the current circumstances regarding testing and tracing.  To date, we have completed more than 750,000 tests.  Last week, we recorded our highest weekly number of tests since April, at 55,000, and we are recording similarly high numbers again this week.  The previous weekly peak was in April, when we tested 60,000.  The median end-to-end turnaround time over the past seven days is 2.2 days.  Last week, we completed 4,949 contact tracing calls.  These statistics give the committee a sense of the numbers we are contending with and the pace at which we are moving.  Setting up these teams is complex and must be understood in the context of our need to make the best use of resources during peaks and troughs of the virus.  It is important to re-emphasise that testing and tracing is a key tool to protect against transmission of the virus.  However, the primary line of defence is the public health measures we must all take all the time.<\/p> <p>  We are finalising a new model of testing and tracing to set out a more permanent workforce and implement further processes and technology changes.  In respect of outbreaks, testing and tracing works hand in glove with the work of our public health teams.  Throughout this pandemic, our public health teams have adopted a rapid, robust and comprehensive response to prevent, identify and control outbreaks where they occur, utilising the best public health knowledge and science available.  I pay special tribute to all our public health teams who have been working relentlessly for the past seven months.<\/p> <p>  The national standing oversight committee on cases and outbreaks of Covid-19 in high-risk settings was established by the HSE on 7 August and includes a broad range of cross-sectoral representation.  Criteria for the assessment of meat plant outbreaks, to inform decisions regarding their closure and reopening, have been developed.  This utilises a standard public health risk assessment model, emphasising that blanket measures may not be helpful.  We have also worked with the Department of Education and Skills on similar criteria for responding to outbreaks in schools, which will be a key focus in the coming weeks and months.  While institutional and workplace settings are receiving much attention, our public health departments are also responding to a large number of outbreaks in private households and among family, sporting and social groups.  By 22 August, our public health teams had responded to a total of 2,580 outbreaks since the onset of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  As for hospitalisations, while there has been an increase in the transmission of the virus, the indications are that our hospitals have not as yet been confronted with a similar increase in admissions.  There are currently 23 patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 and four in ICU, with three currently being ventilated.  The lower rate of admission may be attributable to the lower age profile of patients that has characterised the resurgence of the disease in recent months.  There is, however, no room for complacency and we have plans in place to deal with a surge in hospitalisations. <\/p> <p>  We are facing into a very difficult period in our health services.  In an ideal world, the elimination of the virus would make our work somewhat more straightforward, but this is not our reality.  We must live with this virus in a very new way and this requires a carefully balanced approach.  The health services need a functioning economy and society.  Shutting down the economy and society has implications for our health services.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I again pay special thanks to everyone working in healthcare.  We have witnessed much of what is great about the people who work in it.  We all now need to support them again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid, in particular for being so timely.<\/p><p>Generally, members are speaking for five minutes so I will indicate when they have reached four minutes and stop them at five because time is of the essence.

That said, it is inevitable that there will be suspect cases, cases and there may even be outbreaks.  That is the price we must pay in order to open schools again, with all of the educational, health and welfare benefits this brings to children.  Public health departments will apply the same principles as they do to outbreaks in other settings and will take a risk assessment approach.  In any outbreak setting, they will look at the individual characteristics of the school, the rates of community transmission, the number of cases in the school and the number of serious illnesses that might emerge - which would be very uncommon and unusual in children - as well as hospitalised cases and ICU admissions.  They will also look at the interplay with the community, the infrastructure of the school and the capability of the school to adhere to infection prevention and control measures.

We have developed an algorithm working with experts in paediatrics, general practice, primary care and public health.  This algorithm and the pathway were discussed with almost 2,000 GPs in a webinar two nights ago.  It describes the series of actions that will be taken once a suspect case emerges in a school.  As was highlighted by my colleague, Dr. Mary Favier, the other night, it balances the need for continuity in education with the need to identify cases where they emerge with children.  For example, children with sniffles or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms do not warrant testing and can continue to attend at school while those more specific symptoms such as cough, respiratory symptoms, loss of taste or loss of smell do merit isolation and testing.  This algorithm is for GPs and will be communicated clearly to principals in schools to enable them to take the appropriate set of actions should there be a suspect case in school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Witnesses in committee room 2 are having difficulty hearing us so I ask everyone to speak loudly and clearly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#E00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>From the diaphragm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#E00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank all the members of the HSE.

We are looking at this plan very differently now because it is not just about a winter plan and what we would normally have to do in winter.  It is about how we and our services cope, how we protect the public, our patients and our staff with Covid virus, and about the level the virus reaches at different stages.  We have done two things.  We have significant funding already in place which is supporting a number of initiatives that we put in place in the early stages of Covid.  We are also finalising plans with the board of the HSE and through Government for a set of funding to see us through the winter and through 2021.  This will involve a range of significant, different approaches aiming to keep people out of hospitals, including the likes of the community assessment hubs that we used during Covid in a very different way to treat respiratory illnesses, to try to filter out the number of people who will need to come to a hospital setting, the number of outpatients that we can have in place outside of a hospital and in our community services, and a range of investments which are the traditional investments in home care packages and our community service and community intervention teams, and the Covid response teams.  This is a range of initiatives that strengthen our community services, reduce the impacts on our acute services but also significantly increase our capacity in the community services.  One further aspect of that response will be our engagement with and utilisation of the private hospitals, as took place throughout the first phase, but in a very different way.<\/p><p>I am happy to go through how that may look in the future.

What capacity are they currently operating under in comparison with pre-Covid times?

Our key focus for these services is to protect the public and our staff.  Some of the cancer screening programmes are more difficult in that regard.  We have launched a plan which steps up capacity in all of them.

For example, in the BowelScreen programme the test is done at home but the main dependency is the availability of a colonoscopy.  A colonoscopy is a procedure and a service that has a reduced capacity for delivery because of the infection prevention and control measures that are necessary in the Covid environment.  We are aiming to resume that screening programme at the end of September, as with BreastCheck.  BreastCheck was supporting symptomatic breast care services during the first phase of the pandemic and it will be resuming all services at the end of September.

The testing centre in Tinryland, County Carlow, which is in CHO 5, has been closed.  Will the testing centres in Limerick and elsewhere that have been closed be reopened?  The woman was tested at 1 o'clock on Friday.  Today is Wednesday and she has not received her results.  I am aware of other similar cases.  This is what is happening on the ground.  People are being tested.  If the members of a family are tested, they must isolate and stay inside.  They cannot go to work.  It is unacceptable that people are waiting six days to receive results. <\/p> <p>  I was contacted by a business in County Carlow.  One of its employees contracted Covid and the business did not know what to do.  I rang the Minister for Health.  A person working on the business premises was diagnosed with Covid and had to isolate for 14 days.  The owners did not know whether the business should close or remain open.  They decided to close because they wished to be fair to people.  There are no guidelines to cover such circumstances.  The business was closed for 14 days.  No urgent system of testing was put in place for its employees.  The employees were out of work for two weeks because the business had to close when one employee got Covid.<\/p> <p>  I refer to counties which border counties Laois, Offaly or Kildare.

Ultimately, however, as we have seen over the past few weeks in particular, while everybody had predominantly been talking about when we might see a second surge, I think the reality is that what we are seeing in the country right now is probably what we are going to be living with for the future with this virus.  We are going to see significant peaks and, we hope, significant troughs very soon and those changes may not always be national.  They could be regional and, in some cases, local.  That is the new reality for us in terms of living with this virus and the transmission we have seen to date.  Therefore, our plans are now not so much around a second surge and a mass scaling up or scaling down.  The focus now is around agility, how we adapt, scale up and scale down, and how we try to get back our services, which I referenced a while ago.  We were very strong in our document that it is all dependent on the transmission of the virus at any particular given time.  We are constantly focused, every week, on where is the level of transmission of the virus and what services we need to adapt.  The focus is not always on the acute services.  In fact, at this time, the services we have had to step up are primarily in community services and particularly in public health teams.  The situation is not quite as black and white as we might have expected at the start of this, where we expected to see surges.

I fully respect that and we will need to continue with serial testing in various settings.  It represents a very significant cost.

The rate of positive results was 0.13%.  It is a very significant cost and absorbs a lot of resources.  I appreciate that it gives the public a lot of reassurance, but it is not the major tool with which we can protect the public.  I want to state that very clearly.

He referenced the number of hospital cases being low, thankfully, and we want to keep it that way.  We now face uncertainty as we have seen a rapid increase in the transmission of the virus among those below the age of 45.  I understand that 75% or, in some cases, 80% of the positive cases are now in those aged under 45.  Our concern is community transmission and the impact on other groups.<\/p> <p>  I would make the point that nobody is immune to the virus and some of its impacts.  Younger people may think they will not suffer from it.  There are extreme cases where people had really bad illnesses as a result of Covid.  Our specific concern is the spread of transmission further in the community and among vulnerable groups, particularly older people.  We want to protect our hospitals in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Our colleagues in NPHET will come before the committee later.  The measures taken at different stages are recommended by NPHET, based on the best knowledge it has at the time and which it has communicated to Government.  From our perspective, I understand the concern.  From a health service perspective, the impact of lockdown is key and we know it is significant.  It has a significant impact on the health service and recovery, as well as on the public in terms of our services being constrained or, in some cases, shut down.  Some of the mental health impacts can be very significant.<\/p><p>I think we are all trying to find an approach that keeps the economy and our society going and can keep our health services going and, equally, protect our public.

I compliment the community in Golden, in my county, where an incident broke out two weeks ago in Walsh Mushrooms.  I got a phone call from Kate Killeen of the HSE, whom I thank and who kept me informed.  The Army, the Garda, the Ambulance Service and everybody else rolled in and did the testing on a parish site.  This can be contrasted with the rumours abounding about a plant in Cahir for weeks, finally admitted last week, and then testing being done privately.  Now Mr. Reid has just told another Deputy that the tests are being paid for by the HSE.  We could get no information on this, and there was no phone call from the HSE.  It had no information.  We could get no information yesterday or all weekend on the number of tests.  A number of shops, including excellent ones in our wonderful town of Cahir, had to issue statements to deny rumours of incidents on their premises.  There were huge mixed messages, and the treatment of a community in Tipperary was different from that of a big business there.  We value those businesses, but the question is of special treatment, and now we find that the HSE is paying for the tests anyway.  Was there control over those tests?

There has been much observation internationally, as the Chairman points out, of the lower rate of hospitalisation and some suggests this represents a change in behaviour of the virus, but the virus has been sequenced in Swiss studies and the overall diversity of the virus has not changed.  There is no new variant and there is no development of some less severe mutation.  The most likely explanation for this trend we are seeing internationally is as follows: we know the virus has a steep age-dependent rate of illness and mortality.  The more testing one does, particularly in younger  people, it will result in an imbalance between tests and hospitalisation.  We have seen in this country, as in other countries, a predominant shift towards positivity in younger age groups.  The CEO referenced that 71% of cases in the past two weeks are aged under 45.  It may also reflect that older people are behaving more cautiously and as such are less prone to the illness as they were when we knew less about asymptomatic transition, the mode of transmission of the virus some months ago.  Nevertheless, the big caveat and warning at the end of all that is that there is a lag time between seeding within the community - between open outbreaks in the community such as in some counties or where there is high levels of transmission - and inevitable community transmission leading to older people and vulnerable groups getting the disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>What is that lag time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#T00300","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>The incubation period of the disease is seven to 14 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>We have seen this increase in testing for longer than seven days now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#T00500","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I refer to the spike in detected cases.

As Mr. Reid will be aware, Covid has resulted in considerable additional costs for nursing homes  The Government put in place the temporary assistance payment until September.  Has the HSE made recommendations to the Minister about the continuation of that payment in view of the fact that nursing home payments under the fair deal scheme have not been reviewed for four or five years but they now face additional costs?<\/p> <p>  The Covid expert panel made recommendations on the entitlement of residents with medical cards in nursing homes to community and medical healthcare services.  Has the HSE currently capacity to deal with that issue?<\/p><p>One complaint was there was not the access to the supports that nursing homes required when they needed it urgently at the time.  Has that now been revisited?<\/p><p> What is the current procedure when a person in a nursing home needs to attend an outpatient clinic?  What additional precautions have been put in place?  What changes have been made?

The Deputy is correct to ask how we can manage that situation if there are schools with cases or potential outbreaks in the next few weeks.   The first thing to say is we should plan on the basis that there will be positive cases and that it is likely there will be outbreaks throughout the country in different schools.  That is the most likely scenario we have to work towards and it is the one on which we have been working with the Department of Education and Skills.  We have given the Department clear guidance on its role, on communicating with parents and on our role, which is primarily led by our public health teams.<\/p> <p>  I will finish with a brief comment because Dr. Henry covered a bit of this earlier.  I know that people have the urge to get a kind of checklist of what will happen in various situations, where boxes can be ticked, but our public health teams largely go in and assess each school, in this case, or organisation on its individual drivers of the transmission of the virus and various other factors.  The primary driver of our communications will be through local public health teams, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and local schools in how they communicate to parents.  The public health approach involves, exactly as Dr. Henry outlined, a range of factors, including the numbers of cases, how rapid is the spread of cases, the impacts of the cases in terms of hospitalisations, what is happening in the community, what is the response of the local management of the school, and how we get reassurance of what measures were taken or are having an effect.  All of that is geared towards not getting to a scenario of shutdowns.  We will be driving a range of processes, public health led by our public health experts, but communication will be directly from the Department of Education and Skills and local schools to parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>To reiterate, it is unrealistic to expect we can eradicate risk; we cannot.  I recall the committee meeting at the beginning of March when we communicated that clearly.  Viral upper-respiratory tract symptoms are very common in primary school children and the vast majority are due to more common ailments.  In communicating this to parents, principals, teachers and wider society, we are trying to strike a balance between the significant health and well-being benefits for children in education, that is, the opportunities this presents to health, such as vaccines and screening for vision, hearing and so on, versus the risk of transmission of the virus.  As I said earlier, the emerging evidence is that child-to-child transmission in a school setting occurs at a lower frequency and is rarer than we initially thought.  What we have to have in place is clear communication to GPs, a clear definition of cases, insofar as we can when one considers all the other illnesses children get at that time of the year, and a rapid testing strategy for those who are funnelled through to testing as determined by a general practitioner.  As I said, we have been working this week with primary care and public health teams to create an algorithm for this purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Carthy, who has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#V00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#V00500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We will go round the room and come back to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#V00600","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>To be clear, I had ten minutes on this slot.

The actions taken and the approaches recommended by Government were directly related to what the analysis was demonstrating in terms of transmission.  One key lesson is that the public health measures are absolutely key.  We have spent a lot of time today talking about testing and tracing and rightly so but I feel the need to really emphasise that the public health measures are our 80% factor in terms of suppressing this virus and mitigating against further transmission.  Testing and tracing can be a 15% to 20% factor; an important one but not the major factor.  The big lesson is and remains the role of the public health measures.

Even though we may change, the virus has not.  As I said earlier, the evidence is that the virus has not changed.  It is not less vicious or transmissible.  In an uncontrolled setting the doubling time is a matter of days.  A small number of cases can lead to a rapid escalation if uncontrolled and unmitigated.  What we saw in Kildare and the other counties to a lesser extent was the hazardous effect of open clusters and how they can seed out into the community, hence the measures that have been continued in Kildare.  With an incidence rate over 14 days of 180 per 100,000, that presents a real and immediate threat to widespread community transmission, which is a huge threat to safety, health and well-being and to the continuation of health and education services in Kildare and beyond.  Allowing for the fact that counties are not enclosed structures in themselves, it presents hazards to contiguous counties including Dublin.  The virus has not changed.  It is very transmissible.  Outbreaks whether in meat plants, workplace settings or elsewhere, can seed out into the community.  That is where it is important to emphasise that for a virus for which there is no treatment and no vaccine, those measures which we all know by heart by now are the first and primary line of defence.  When we have outbreaks, rapid identification, isolation of cases and contact tracing represent the second line of defence.

It is effectively the third lockdown because we had the original lockdown like everybody else, a second lockdown and then a third, unlike other counties.  Would it be reasonable to deduce that Kildare has the highest rate of transmission or incidence per 100,000 of population in the country?  It seems to be the most acute hub of incidence right now according to the advice and the fact that we are under lockdown again.  In that context it is reasonable that every effort be made to ramp up testing, to make it available at all corners and to remove any barriers to doing so.  I was made aware recently of an issue arising if a suspect case presents out of hours in Kildare.  A constituent of mine presented last Saturday to the only out of hours health service available in Kildare, which is KDOC.  Unless patients have a medical card, they have to pay a &euro;50 consultation fee.  I confirmed with the Minister for Health on Saturday that the HSE's position is that Covid testing is free of charge.  No barriers should be put in front of anybody presenting for a test.  The principle applies across the country but it is particularly acute when Kildare is the only county in a third period of lockdown and appears to be the epicentre of Covid in Ireland.  I have had extensive conversations with KDOC's management team and they advised me they are aware of the HSE guidance.  My understanding is that there is an operational agreement yet to be entered into or signed off on.  Time is not a luxury that we can enjoy here.  We are into our third lockdown and have ten days.  The clock is ticking to see if we can escape from that.  We do not know how many more cases are transmitting or about to be identified in the community.<\/p><p>If people are being turned away from test centres because there is a &euro;50 charge for the test and they cannot afford it, that is not good enough.  I can see both sides of the story but heads need to be banged together to get this matter resolved.  I hope Mr. Reid can advise us of good news on the matter this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#Y00400","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his opening comments which, I am sure, our teams around the country and all Deputies will appreciate.

The public health response to Covid-19 to date has been guided by public health data and expertise and international best practice, and has been underpinned by ethical principles, including the minimisation of harm, proportionality, solidarity, fairness and privacy.  The central focus of our response has been to control the spread of the virus in so far as possible to protect those who are most vulnerable from infection, as well as protecting against causes, situations, circumstances and behaviours that can lead to the spread of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  In the absence of a vaccine or treatment at present, the key to controlling Covid-19 is to adopt a proportionate, dynamic and stepwise response tailored to the evolving epidemiological situation and the wider public health and health service context.  The foundation underpinning this approach has been the wide acceptance of, and buy-in to, the basic but essential public health protective measures, including hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, social distancing, avoidance of crowds and the use of face coverings, where appropriate, by the Irish public.  People in Ireland have shown that they are willing to follow public health advice to protect themselves and others.

In Europe, while the situation had stabilised in early summer, many countries are now seeing an increase in cases and have had to reintroduce public health measures.<\/p> <p>  Here, our own public health approach proved effective and by 24 June our five-day average was just six new cases per day.  However, since the beginning of July there has been a gradual change in our epidemiological situation, and by the end of July a large number of cases emerged rapidly in Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  These cases were initially predominantly linked to several large clusters in food processing plants in the region.  There were also several linked clusters in direct provision centres.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, NPHET was monitoring the situation in that region closely and made related recommendations on 30 July and 4 and 6 August regarding the protection of vulnerable groups living in congregated settings; the mitigation of risk in high-risk workplaces; and the continued enhancement and strengthening of the public health, testing and contact-tracing functions in the HSE.  On 7 August, NPHET recommended to the Government that a series of enhanced public health measures should be introduced in the three counties for a two-week period to bring the situation under control and prevent widespread transmission.<\/p> <p>  The NPHET reviewed the situation on 20 August and advised the Government that the position in Laois and Offaly had improved and the measures did not need to be extended.  The situation in Kildare was different.  While there was a certain level of stabilisation, a high number of cases continued to be reported daily, with cases widely distributed across the county and with incidence rates at several multiples of the national average.  Several facilities were still undergoing mass testing as a result of recent cases and there was evidence of some increasing community transmission in the county.  For that reason, NPHET recommended that the measures in Kildare should be extended until 6 September.<\/p><p>Separately, on 17 August, NPHET considered the deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country and recommended several public health measures to apply nationwide until 13 September to mitigate against any further increase in cases.<\/p><p> I am fully aware of how disappointing and frustrating recent events have been.  As a country, we have demonstrated so much resilience, solidarity and resolve throughout this pandemic.  We have set aside our plans and put our lives on hold for many months to suppress this virus.  As a society, we have done that incredibly effectively.  Although we have taken a step backwards, this is not irreversible.  With the continued support and collective effort of people in Ireland, we can stop the rise in cases and protect what must be our three priorities in the coming months: the protection of the most vulnerable in society, the resumption of healthcare services and the return to education for children and young people.<\/p><p> This is a marathon and I know people are tired.  I acknowledge the enormous and ongoing effort and sacrifice by people in Ireland to help protect each other during this pandemic and I ask them to continue to stay the course with us.  By continuing to work together, by building on the individual and collective action which has characterised our response to date and by supporting each other, we will navigate our way together through the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#JJ00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Glynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I invite Professor Nolan to deliver his introductory remarks and ask that he limit them to five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#KK00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to update the committee on the work of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, IEMAG, and, in particular, to offer some perspectives on the recent increase in the incidence of Covid-19.  We need to be aware at all times that statistical analyses and mathematical models provide very useful insights but have important limitations.  As such, our input has always been and must always be contextualised within the wider public health expertise available within NPHET.<\/p> <p>  The strict public health measures put in place between March and June 2020 brought the pandemic under control.  As of 18 June 2020, the date of phase 3 reopening, we were detecting, on average, 13 cases of Covid-19 per day and had a 14&ndash;day cumulative incidence of 5.2 per 100,000 population.  Thereafter, the level of disease continued to decline for one to two weeks such that at the end of June and in early July the average number of new cases per day was ten and the 14-day cumulative incidence was 3.2 per 100,000.  We estimated at that point that fewer than one in 30,000 people in the population had an active infection.<\/p> <p>  However, from late June onwards, we began to see an increase in incidence.  This appears to have had three components.  First, an increase in viral transmission seems to have begun soon after 18 June, leading to a small, slow increase in cases over the period from 7 July to 20 July.  This is understandable and, to a certain extent, was expected.  As people increased their numbers of contacts and perhaps began to relax a little with regard to hygiene and physical distancing measures, the virus transmitted more easily.  This was associated with an increase in the reproduction number above 1.0, which was clearly flagged to the public in early July.  The public seems to have responded by taking added precautions, as case numbers and the reproduction number decreased again towards the end of July.<\/p> <p>  Second, a number of large outbreaks in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, as alluded to by the acting Chief Medical Officer, developed in the week beginning 27 July 2020.  These outbreaks were quite explosive, with the virus entering and spreading rapidly within specific workplace settings.  Epidemiologically, this acted as an amplifying event and significantly increased the overall burden of disease in the country as a whole and in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly in particular.  The outbreaks were controlled, and significant community transmission prevented, by the outbreak management actions of public health teams, as well as population level public health measures applied in those three counties, as Dr. Glynn mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Third, since early August and in parallel with these events, we have seen a wide variety of smaller outbreaks with modest levels of community transmission.  The cases associated with the major outbreaks to which I referred seeded further outbreaks in households and extended families, but separately, and much more widely within the country, sporadic cases led to household and workplace outbreaks which spread between households and in a variety of workplace, social and sporting settings and, hence, more widely within the community.<\/p><p>The most recent set of public health restrictions to limit indoor and outdoor congregation and mixing between households is specifically aimed at minimising this inter-household spread and keeping community prevalence and transmission to a minimum.  It is my evaluation that these challenges were anticipated and detected quickly and that the responses were timely, specific, proportionate and, in so far as we can tell at this time, effective.  It should be noted, as Dr. Glynn has done, that similar patterns of resurgent disease have been seen in other jurisdictions in recent weeks.<\/p><p> We are at an important juncture.  The next few weeks will show whether we, as a society, are capable of resuming the most important of our social, economic, educational, healthcare, cultural and sporting activities without spreading the virus between households and into our communities to any significant extent.  They will show whether we are, as the acting Chief Medical Officer has put it, capable of \"protecting our priorities while living with the threat of this virus and keeping it at bay\".  I would like to record again my appreciation of the team of academic and public service colleagues who support the work of the modelling advisory group, the public health colleagues who work tirelessly to protect us from this virus and, at the same time, provide us with the information that informs our analyses and understanding of the disease, and, like Dr. Glynn, my appreciation of the general public, whose fortitude and solidarity in the face of this crisis are inspirational.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Lawless.  I pay tribute to all our health professionals, as I did during the earlier session with the witnesses from the HSE.  It has been a very trying time during which the focus has been on protecting lives.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, have to be very careful that we put people's health and lives first.  As we head into the cold and flu season, there is some confusion as to whether we are going into a second wave of Covid infections.  The witnesses may have heard the discussion on the radio this morning where we were told that people are not aware that they can ring their doctor free of charge to get information about Covid symptoms and what they need to do if they have them.<\/p> <p>  I have been dealing with the concerns of local businesspeople over the past few months.  The witnesses referred to the restrictions in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  I live in the Graiguecullen area of Carlow town, which is half in Carlow and half in Laois.  Some businesses in the area have had to close, which was very hard given that we are so far away from the outbreaks in Laois.  I spoke to the Minister about their situation and asked for a buffer to be applied.  If something like this ever happens again, which I hope it never does, there must be better communication with the businesses and people affected.  There are housing estates in Graiguecullen that are half in Carlow and half in Laois and there was huge confusion among the people living there.  When information is given on these types of restrictions, there needs to be clarity on where exactly they apply and consideration should be given to a buffer zone.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to testing.  We saw last week that 13,000 tests were done in one day, which, months into the crisis, was the highest number of tests done in a single day.  Are we going to see a ramping up of testing as the schools reopen?  Recent infections seem to be happening in clusters, including in meat factories and direct provision centres.  What is being done in regard to that pattern of infections?  I have had several telephone calls from people asking about what testing is being done at airports, which is a huge concern for me.  I am not aware of any definite cases but my understanding is that people coming in from red zone countries are not self-isolating for 14 days.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about whether we have enough personal protective equipment, PPE, particularly in view of the spike in cases and as schools and hospital services reopen.  It is vital that we have adequate supplies of PPE for front-line service staff.<\/p> <p>  The most pressing question I have concerns wet pubs.  Like all of us here, I have been contacted by owners of wet pubs who say they will be able to control their environment.  Their businesses are the only ones that have not reopened and many of them do not know whether they will be allowed to open.  In addition, there was huge confusion last week among owners of dance studios and theatres regarding the reduction in permitted indoor numbers from 15 to six.  Several dance studio owners contacted me to say that this new restriction will see them lose their livelihood.  I understand that the witnesses must put people's health first but where we are talking about a controlled environment in which the guidelines can be followed, why was the decision made not to open wet pubs and not to allow dance studios and other businesses to have 15 people instead of six?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Glynn will respond to those questions.  I realise there are a lot of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#LL00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Her key question is whether we are on the cusp of a second wave.  I hope we are not but there is no doubt we have seen a deteriorating situation over the past couple of months, if we are being honest, since the start of July.  It is no surprise that we have seen more cases as we have eased restrictions and that we have seen a greater proportion and a greater number of cases in younger people.  All of that is normal and I will take this opportunity to counter the narrative of blame that has been taken up around younger people.  Younger people go out to work.  They run our health service and our education service.  They keep society going and so they come into contact with other people.  By the nature of their lives, we will see more cases in younger people.<\/p> <p>  That said, we have grown increasingly concerned, overall, at the number of cases we are seeing.  That led to the recommendation of the additional measures last week for the country.  I know there has been some confusion around those measures but, at its heart, we are asking people to cut down their discretionary social contacts.  We understand that is difficult for people but if we do not cut down the number of people that each of us comes into contact with, there is no doubt but that, unfortunately, the number of cases will continue to rise.  If the number of cases continues to rise, it will inevitably lead to more cases in older people and those who are medically vulnerable.  They have to be our central focus in this.  All over Europe we are seeing an increase in cases.  So far, all over Europe we are seeing an increase in cases in younger people without a concomitant increase in hospitalisations in ICU but there is no guarantee that will continue.  If our number of cases continues to rise, we would be concerned about the impact that will have in terms of hospitalisation, admissions to critical care and mortality.<\/p> <p>  In relation to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#MM00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Glynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Sorry, I have to cut Dr. Glynn short.

We have an underfunded and overcrowded education system.  An example of that is the grotesque sight of an isolation room in a national school in Athlone in a garden shed.  I do not put the blame on the school but on Department of Education and Skills underfunding.  I know the witnesses cannot comment on that.  Because of overcrowded school estates, social distancing is simply not possible in some schools due to a lack of space.  That is the reality at this time.  The implied message from the Department seems to be to carry on regardless.  That is what I am picking up.  If a school cannot achieve social distancing, is it safe for it to reopen?

Many of the answers pivoted on the GP being informed, after which the issue would fall on what she termed \"public health\".  Parents would prefer to have a much clearer idea, though.  Dr. Glynn could give a detailed response, so perhaps he will provide a written answer on who should isolate and what the considerations are.<\/p> <p>  For now, I will ask a more direct question.  If a child receives a negative test result, is it safe for him or her to return to school immediately?  According to Dr. Mary Favier, if a child has sniffles or is sneezing and is otherwise well, he or she can attend.  Coughing was not commented on, though.  Many children are asthmatic or have other respiratory illnesses and coughing occurs frequently outside of Covid cases.  Where children are frequently coughing, should they refrain from attending school and isolate?  Greater publicity for some of these issues is needed.

There will be children with coughs as part of underlying conditions, but at issue is the onset of a new cough.  On any given day over the next number of months, if a parent or carer has a particular concern, he or she needs to act with an abundance of caution in the first instance and keep his or her child at home.

This morning, the HSE told us:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe refer people for day 0 tests and day 7 tests.

I acknowledge that 98% of all tests are negative, which is reassuring, but it is also a reason to ensure that those who do not turn up actually are tested.<\/p><p>This is a particularly important question in the context of recent public commentary.  The reason it is of particular important is that, of course, we are proponents of testing and want people to turn up for their day 0 and day 7 tests.  That is absolutely vital.  We are looking at alternative testing modalities that might be less uncomfortable than the traditional test we are using at the moment, particularly for the day 7 test.  However, the result of that test does not change what people need to do.  If someone is a close contact of a confirmed case, he or she needs to restrict his or her movement for 14 days.  We want more people to come forward for testing.  What is more important than anything is that if people have symptoms, they must not take the traditional approach of waiting to see how it goes for a couple of days but, instead, come forward immediately, put their hands up, contact a GP, identify themselves as having symptoms and get a test.  That is the way in the first instance that we will control the spread of this disease and protect individuals and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#NN00700","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>There has been commentary from some doctors in the media about people who presented to them with symptoms but did not go for the test even though they were recommended to do so.

That has had a devastating effect on the local economy but also on the public at large.  Confidence and morale is at a significant low at the moment as people try to grapple with the effects of this, and it is psychological as well as economic.  People are prepared to get on with it and to do with the right thing once they can understand it, buy into it and support it.<\/p><p> I have listened to the testimony of both witnesses and they have both spoken about the importance of the workplaces and the clusters that have emerged in recent weeks.  One of the questions that I, as a public representative in the county, have been asked repeatedly and will be asked again this evening when I meet with the Kilcock business association, given Kilcock has had just one case in two months, is why the entire county is in lockdown when it appears to be confined to a few workplaces.  I have asked this question of many people, including the acting CMO at a conference call last week, and on many other occasions during the last few weeks.  The answer I was given, which I believe because I believe the public health advice, is that the entire county has incidences, there are cases everywhere and it has spread beyond those initial workplaces or clusters.  However, we really need to demonstrate that to drive buy-in and get public support and acceptance for the measures.  People will follow the logic and follow the evidence for themselves if they have it.<\/p><p> We need to make that data available.  This is something I have called for, as did the Taoiseach in yesterday's radio interview when he agreed it should be made available.  We should make available microdata at electoral district, ED, level, while ensuring it is not low enough to embarrass anybody in terms of GDPR but is high enough for people to understand whether it is in their town or townland.  A set of figures was made available on 12 August and that was the first set of localised figures since June, so there was a two-month gap, and ED level figures have not been made available since 12 August.  Effectively, if we go back as far as June, we have one date for which localised figures are available, and nothing before or since.  This is a live issue, not an academic issue, an esoteric issue or something we can resolve in a fortnight's time.  Kildare is in lockdown today, businesses are struggling today, the people are struggling today and we do not have figures for today, for yesterday or for tomorrow.  I understand the Government is in entire agreement.

On the Deputy's point, the figures for Kildare have been given every single day over the past number of weeks and for Laois and Offaly for the two weeks in particular.

I have said previously that the county boundary is crude but we had to take some crude measure.  As we heard earlier, the cases were not confined to Kildare and we have seen cases in Carlow and Wexford, for example, linked to the issues in Kildare, thankfully at a lower level.  However, in broad terms, we had to pick a geography.<\/p> <p>  As we said previously, and as the WHO has said, at times we have to move fast at the enemy at the cost of perfection.  I would put my hands up and say that but, in saying that, when we make these decisions, we have a set of data in front of us at a point of time and we have to make recommendations and decisions based on the potential for what might happen over the following days.<\/p> <p>  To go back to our meeting on 7 August where I made those recommendations, on that day there had been 150 cases in Kildare in the previous 14 days but 128 of those had arisen in the previous seven days, so we were very justified at that point in moving quickly to prevent community transmission.<\/p><p>To echo the Deputy's words, I acknowledge in particular the work and buy-in of the people in Kildare, notwithstanding their anger and frustration about what has happened.

Many parents in Kildare are fearful of sending their children back to school this week, during the county-wide restrictions.  They feel their children are being used as part of a big experiment.

I do not believe there has been any set of recommendations that NPHET has made or a set of measures that has not specifically referenced those who are older and those who are medically vulnerable.  In relation to Kildare, Laois and Offaly, I made specific reference to this group the day before we met to consider the measures because I wanted those children and adults to take particular care.  Last week, a similar set of statements was made about the country more generally.<\/p> <p>  With regard to children, I fully understand there is anxiety and concern among parents nationally and, of course, in particular in Kildare given the set of circumstances but, as I answered earlier, thankfully we have not seen a greater level of community transmission in Kildare than we have in the rest of the country.  The profile is very similar to the rest of the country.  The wider profile of Kildare has improved again over recent days.  International evidence suggests that children spreading Covid to other children in schools is relatively uncommon and that schools are not a key driver of community transmission of this disease.  We know from our own data in Ireland that to date fewer than 3% of children in the country under 14 years of age have been diagnosed with Covid and of these, only 42 have been hospitalised to date.  Of course there will be cases, and these cases have arisen in recent weeks throughout the country, but the key to minimising the harm that comes out of these cases is for us all to act together and quickly.  To come back to my earlier point, if people have concerns, they should keep their child at home and contact their GP in the first instance.

The two lessons that have been learned are that if we react quickly we can bring the disease back under control.  That is what the Kildare, Laois and Offaly outbreaks showed.  The second thing they show is that if there is a very large outbreak the risk of diffusion into households and communities is higher than if there are smaller outbreaks.  There was a greater volume of cases and spread into household settings in Kildare than in Laois and Offaly.  In response to an earlier question, this could have happened in any county in the country.  Most counties in the country have the kind of workplace settings that are capable of amplifying this disease.  Quite a lot has been learned within those settings.<\/p> <p>  For the reasons Dr. Glynn alluded to earlier, in terms of the reopening schools there is a level of assurance.  It is very unlikely that if a child were to bring a disease into a school he or she would spread it to another child.  It is then unlikely that the child would bring the virus home and spread it back into his or her home.  We need to remember that adults moving around in society, in workplaces and other settings, are more likely to transmit it between households via adult-to-adult transmission.  In no way is it is an experiment.

I think Dr. Glynn, as a public health specialist, would be better placed to comment on some of that.  There are particular circumstances that apply in industrial settings, where there might be chilling, high airflow and so on.  Leaving those factors aside, any high-contact workplace, as one might call them, represents a risk of transmission.  We have seen and continue to see smaller outbreaks - smaller because the workplace settings are smaller - in a very wide variety of settings.  It is simply a matter of emphasis.  Public health colleagues would concentrate on the fact that any workplace where people are required to come together and work closely represents a risk of transmission.  Therefore, if an index case appears in such a setting, they move quickly to try to understand whether transmission has occurred within that setting.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is that public health colleagues have a very clear picture in their heads as to which workplace settings are higher-risk and which are lower-risk.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make one other brief comment, though, which is that there are also high-traffic situations, such as in the hospitality and service industries, where people are not necessarily congregating but the staff are exposed to a high traffic of people past them.  This is a situation in which not only do we want to watch for transmission but the employees need to be very careful in their preventative measures, and the patrons of those services need to respect the fact that those staff are also front-line staff.  The patrons needs to be exceptionally careful not to transmit the virus in attending a restaurant, bar, hotel or whatever else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#SS00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Nolan for that.

I will go through the three questions and he can take them all together.<\/p> <p>  There is a particular risk of outbreaks in congregated settings such as schools and meat factories.  As NPHET considers the broad use of low-sensitivity, low-cost, rapid, frequent antigen testing, does Dr. Glynn accept that frequency and rapidity of testing may be more important factors in outbreak detection than high sensitivity?  Should blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients be considered as a treatment for infected people who have been hospitalised?  Third, the latest Government advice is that people should avoid using public transport where possible.  According to the Garda, road fatalities have increased by 9% over the past year, and 27% of those who died were walking or cycling.  Has NPHET weighed up the costs to society of more deaths through road collisions and increased air pollution, as more people are encouraged to drive, against the benefits of increased isolation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#SS00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>To respond to the Deputy's first question about high-risk settings or places, my background is in public health medicine, and one of the reasons we get into public health medicine is to level up and help those in society who are most vulnerable.  If a pandemic does anything, it shines a light on those in our society who are most vulnerable, and this pandemic is no different.  The work my colleagues in the HSE and public health are doing now is just on a greater scale in respect of vulnerable groups: Roma, the Travelling community, those living in direct provision and those living in residential care facilities.  Infectious diseases impact these groups disproportionately, and we need to continue to do all we can to ensure that these groups in particular are protected as we navigate our way through the coming months.  That is why at all times when I talk about where we are going with this, I say this is one of the three priorities on which we must focus.<\/p><p>As a society, we all have a role to play as individuals in keeping transmission of this disease low so that those who are less fortunate than ourselves are protected from community transmission and the effects it will have on them if they become infected.<\/p><p> In relation to antigen testing and blood plasma, I would say that all new technologies and interventions, including testing and diagnostic screening treatments, are being kept under review.  We are open to all of them.  At present we are looking at new forms of testing to complement our existing nasopharyngeal swab and polymerase chain reaction, PCR, tests and we will continue to do that.  We are constantly looking to improve our surveillance, whether through waste-water surveillance or other methods.  This is an evolving situation.  We are learning, but we do not want to rush something through that is not ready or will have unintended detrimental consequences in terms of our ability to manage this.  We are absolutely open to learning, changing and evolving, but we need to do that in a considered way.<\/p><p> In relation to the avoidance of public transport where possible, the effect on air pollution is not one of our considerations in the first instance given that we have recommended this for such a short period of time and that wider use of transport more generally would have been down so much for such a prolonged period of time.  Of course, I understand that our recommendations have an impact, but when we make recommendations the intention is that if those recommendations are effective, they will only be implemented for a short and targeted period of time to protect public health in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#SS00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Glynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Glynn and Deputy Leddin.

It will miss a lot of cases and will come up with a lot of false positives if there is only a one in 20,000 chance or one in 10,000 chance that the person has the disease.  This shows the limitations of testing.  A negative test does not necessarily prove the person does not have the disease.  If the risk is low, sometimes a positive test can be false.  We need better testing technologies and better testing regimes.  Certainly, from the research and literature on what we know, strict self-isolation or restricted movements will always be part of a travel regimen.  This is what protects from the spread of the disease.  We may be able to improve testing regimens that can shorten the time or change the nature of the time but realistically, in the long term, we are going to be living with restrictions on movement, perhaps alleviated somewhat by a better testing regimen.

I frequently struggle to try to figure out what our national strategy is with Covid-19.  There are calls for different approaches and so on, but I assume there is a general approach that is about minimising the rate of the virus.  Clearly, the whole test and tracing regime is a key element of that.<\/p><p>We discussed that earlier with representatives of the HSE.  In the early months, we spent a long time trying to get the testing and tracing system to capacity.  By the time it was at capacity of 100,000 per week, the case numbers were very low.  It seems there is now a certain degree of struggling to ramp up testing again to meet the increased numbers.  I asked Mr. Paul Reid this morning about the approach that is being taken and why, if there is a capacity of 100,000, the HSE is not using that full capacity for both reactive and proactive testing.  He informed me that the HSE's approach to testing is determined by NPHET.  Perhaps Dr. Glynn will answer the question as to why it is that NPHET is not seeking to maximise the capacity that is currently there.  Intuitively, one would think that is the right step to take.<\/p><p> My second question concerns the availability of data.  It is unsatisfactory that we have to keep asking for data, all of which should be open source.  I refer in particular to the electoral division figures, that is, the rates per electoral division.  NPHET released figures on 12 August and the previous occasion was 12 June, although many of us had to battle to try to get our hands on those figures.  Why is NPHET not releasing those figures regularly and in real time, rather than an accumulative figure that causes a great deal of hassle for people trying to work out the current figure and the current rate per electoral division?<\/p><p> My third question relates to travel.  I have been tracking the figures that NPHET has been citing in its letters and I have noted the point it has been making about raising alarm bells about the fact that there are significant numbers of travel-related cases relative to those of actual travel cases, which might result in the passing on of the virus to family groups and other settings.  NPHET seemed to be ringing loud alarm bells in that regard for a period but in its recent letters, it has made virtually no reference to figures for travel or cases indirectly related to travel.  Why is that the case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#UU01200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":391,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy's third question first, recent letters have not unduly focused on travel because they have focused on the particular issues that have arisen in the country over the past couple of weeks, and travel has been just a small component of that.

To the Deputy's specific question, of the 69 cases that were travel related over the past 14 days, 20 were imported cases, with the remainder having been acquired through contact with imported cases in the country.<\/p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's second question, I fully accept that the dashboard needs to be updated more regularly.

The key reassuring point to make to parents and carers who are particularly worried is that the vast, vast, vast majority of children who are diagnosed with Covid-19 will have mild, if any, symptoms and our experience in Ireland to date bears that out.  We have had 274 cases in children up to four years of age and 507 cases in children up to 14 years of age to date.

We have seen an increase in cases in children, not transmissions.  Children are getting it from adults but there is very little evidence of child to adult transmission outside of the household, where it does occur, and very little evidence of child to child transmission.  We had 100 cases last week in children.  We will see 100 cases next week and the week after and they will be back in school.  It is really important not to overreact when cases are detected in school.  It is really important that we give public health colleagues the space and respect to allow them to manage any given school cluster or outbreak differently.  In no other walk of life and no other branch of medicine does one expect the full plan to be set out in advance.  We do not ask cardiologists what the plan will be if I have a heart attack next week.  It depends on the type of heart attack and it depends on a whole lot of co-morbidities.  It is exactly the same with schools.  The appropriate reaction to an outbreak in a school depends on the nature of the outbreak and the setting.  We simply have to trust public health colleagues, because they have not let us down before, to properly manage those outbreaks rather than ask them for a specific, precise protocol in advance.

I have had this debate with the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee.  We have asked that the D&aacute;il be allowed to return to its Chamber.  The advice is that we could do so at a 1 m distance but NPHET is insisting on a 2 m distance.  Where is the logic in that?  There are many things that do not make any sense.  I wish Dr. Holohan and his family well.  I understand that some time ago his advice was that mask wearing was of little benefit and that there were question marks around it, yet we are now enforcing the wearing of masks.  There is no logic to what is being done, from start to finish.  <\/p> <p>  I know of a young man who was out last Saturday night fortnight and met a person who had attended a party the previous night at which there were a number of people who were infected with the virus.

He was tested on Monday at 4 p.m. but he did not get the results until 5 p.m. on Friday.  As I said, the area in question is a hotspot. This young man was not asked for details in regard to the other people at the party and, as such, there was no contact tracing.  The process is a mess in many ways. <\/p> <p>  Reference was made to a specific number of tests and contact tracing.  It is not happening.  The system is not fit for purpose.  The mixed messages are unfair.  It was unfair that the young man I mentioned had to miss a week's work and it was unfair to his employer as well.  There was no follow-up, by telephone or otherwise, in regard to the people he met who were infected.  There are some very dubious issues around the process.  We need clarity but we are not getting it.  We also need a roadmap in regard to what we are aiming to do.  I know we are aiming to beat the virus.  Flattening the curve was the big objective and we did that.  <\/p> <p>  I support an earlier speaker who said that we have taken the focus way from hand-washing and hygiene to mask-wearing.  Mask-wearing was supposed to be not safe.  It was frowned upon at the start.  Why do we keep changing the goalposts?  How are we to get the public to keep supporting us in this situation, including the continued lockdown of pubs?  I thank the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, for not imposing a lockdown on Tipperary, as happened in Kildare and so on.  We cannot afford it.  It cannot be sustained.  <\/p> <p>  As I said, there are too many mixed messages and illogical decisions, including, as I mentioned earlier, the &euro;9 sandwich which allows a person to drink in a pub while wet pubs cannot open.  That does not make any sense.  I ask the witnesses to respond to as many of my questions as they can and to reply to me in writing in regard to those questions they cannot answer today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#ZZ00500","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>NPHET never said anything about a &euro;9 meal.

An excellent seroprevalence study has been carried out.  It shows an overall prevalence of antibodies of approximately 1.7%.  The prevalence is higher in Dublin, which was the epicentre of the original pandemic, at approximately 3%, and lower in Sligo, at 0.6%.  The study shows two things.  It shows that very few people in this country have been infected with the virus and, as such, there is no level of immunity to protect us, which is why we are utterly reliant on the public health measures to protect us through the winter and into next year.  The second thing it shows is that our modelling and surveillance system is excellent and that we picked up one in three cases all the way through the pandemic.  Allowing for the fact that half of those cases will be asymptomatic, that is what we would have predicted in our most optimistic estimation of how good our surveillance system would be.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the earlier discussion, we need to remember that we are talking about large numbers but that we also need to think about the small numbers and we need to think about our reproduction number.

The whole objective of what may seem like disproportionate measures to prevent people congregating is literally to prevent that situation occurring in the context of all those separate individuals in their households.

However, that is contingent on the levels of the disease remaining stable.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to recognise the work of healthcare professionals generally, who, in effect, bounced from managing a pandemic to immediately trying to resume services and get things back up and running.

In response to many of the earlier comments, I would say that when people sometimes wonder why NPHET makes recommendations that seem entirely disproportionate, it is because we are trying to protect our healthcare system and its priorities and ensure that people who are waiting for essential appointments can have those appointments and that they are not further delayed as a result of a diversion of resources to manage Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#DDD00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Glynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Will the witnesses come back to me in writing regarding the Danish system?

From the very outset of the crisis, there were some in society who wanted there to be more restrictions and, at the other end of the spectrum, there were others who believed the response was an overreaction.  NPHET has charted a very sensible middle course between those two positions.<\/p> <p>  In recent phases, we have moved from a situation where activities were possible or not possible because of social distancing requirements to a situation where we seem to be saying that some activities are desirable or not desirable based on social mixing.  That has led to some confusion and I do not think we have had that conversation with the Irish people.  For example, I was told about a situation in a holiday setting where a restaurant was open with social distancing of 1 m but an outdoor seating area where music was being played, and where distancing of up to 3 m was possible, was closed.  It would seem to be far safer to have people eating outdoors with greater distancing but there was not an understanding of the rules by the operators.  We need to revisit the discussion around why decisions have been made and clear up the confusion as to whether it is okay if there is distancing of 2 m and not okay if there is not.  We need to look again at how we are communicating why some activities are desirable and others are not.  The discussion around GAA matches and other outdoor games is one of the areas where clarity is needed.  We do not want those activities to go ahead because they involve mixing households, even though distancing of 2 m may be possible.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to organised sports events in indoor facilities.  Guidance from Sport Ireland talks about multiple pods of six being allowed where sufficient space is available in reference to dance classes, athletics classes and so on.  Will the witnesses clarify what is meant by \"sufficient space\"?  In a standard school hall with pods of six, what distance would be needed between those pods?<\/p><p>My final question is about schools.  There will be outbreaks in schools.  We heard earlier from the HSE that they have a plan for that.  Very early on, the first outbreak was in a school in my constituency and the information was circulating more quickly than the public health authorities could respond.  I ask that everything be done to name local clusters because they are already known by parents.  The rumour mill works very fast and I ask that everything be done to have as much transparency as possible when those outbreaks take place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#EEE00800","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1598396400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will make a wider point in response to the first part of his question.  In many ways, the communication challenges we are facing now are much more difficult than those we faced months ago because we simply closed everything and so it was clear to everybody what they should and should not do.  As we try to get more nuanced and try to be as proportionate as possible, we will get things wrong and some of our communications have not been, and will not be, as crystal clear as they should be but we will continue to work on that.  Ultimately, as I replied earlier to Deputy Mattie McGrath, the key messages have not changed.  We want to decrease discretionary social contact between people so that the important elements of human contact can continue as we try to navigate our way through the pandemic.  From that perspective, it comes back to the basic measures that we speak about so regularly.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make one small point of clarification.  We want matches to go ahead and we want training to go ahead.  We understand there are risks associated with that.  We understand there will be cases and clusters arising as a result of that but we weigh that up against the potential loss of those activities in terms of mental, social and physical well-being.  We made recommendations to reduce other elements of social contact so that those activities could continue.<\/p> <p>  With regard to organised sports activities, I have not seen Sport Ireland&rsquo;s guidance but, ultimately, it comes back to people using judgment and understanding that they should be 2 m apart, where possible.  If there is a group of six, it should not interact with another group of six.  It is about limiting contact between households.  If there are six people from six different households and one of them is a case then our public health teams, who have been working incredibly hard over the past number of months, have six different households to contact trace and follow up with.  If the other group comes into contact with that, suddenly we have 12 households, we potentially have 12 workplaces and different school settings.  All of that has to be contact traced and followed up.  The less we congregate and mix between households over the coming weeks, the greater the chances of the current measures having an effect.  <\/p> <p>  We are concerned about the ongoing increase in cases.  If this continues, we will run into trouble in terms of hospitalisations and critical care.  We have only had 90 cases among people aged 65 years and over in the past two weeks.  That is a key reason we have not seen cases in hospitals and critical care units.  That simply will not continue if the increase in cases continues.  We are being given an opportunity by the dynamics and the profile of the cases at the moment, in that the disease is spreading largely among younger people.  We have been given a window of opportunity to take measures, individually and collectively, to stop this before it gets worse.  I urge people to please continue to follow the basic public health advice, never mind all of the confusion that surrounds it - cut down your contacts; cut down the number of people to your home; try to meet up with fewer people, if possible; wash your hands; wear a face covering; and avoid crowds.  They are the simple measures.  They have not, and will not, change over the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#FFF00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ronan Glynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their hard work trying to keep the country safe.<\/p><p> A friend called me yesterday to tell me to turn on \"Drivetime\" because the Kildare county coroner, Professor Denis Cusack, was on.

The committee heard earlier today from the HSE, the acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Glynn, and Professor Nolan about Ireland's operational response to Covid-19 and the prevalence of the virus in our country at this time.  I will take this time, therefore, to update the committee on Ireland's approach and the priorities from now until Christmas.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this year, Ireland and countries across Europe locked down as Covid spread relentlessly through our communities.  Around the world, tens of millions of people have been affected and hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives.  Many lives have been lost here in Ireland as well, and we mourn every single one of them.  It has been a very difficult year for everyone and absolutely heartbreaking for those who have lost family and friends due to Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Staff across the healthcare system have worked tirelessly to prepare an already overburdened health system to cope with Covid-19.  The people of Ireland worked every day and sacrificed much to comply with the lockdown, keep essential services running and flatten the curve.<\/p> <p>  As countries across Europe began to open up, Covid-19 started to spread again.  Countries across Europe are now acting to suppress the virus and here in Ireland we are doing the same.  The first chapter in our fight against Covid-19 was focused on flattening the curve.  The country was locked down.  Schools and colleges were closed.  Businesses were closed.  Much hospital and community care was stopped.  People isolated by staying at home.  Sports, arts and community activities were cancelled.  This approach did flatten the curve but, as we all know, it came at a considerable cost.<\/p> <p>  We are now in the second chapter of the fight against Covid-19.  From now until at least Christmas, our focus will be on suppressing the virus to allow us to reopen society and schools, colleges and health services and to protect jobs and those who are most vulnerable to this awful virus.  Because we know more about the virus now, it has been possible to bring in localised measures where cases grew locally and to bring in national measures as necessary to limit the suppression of the virus through targeted national measures.  Because tens of thousands of tests are being done every week, it has been possible to act quickly and suppress the virus as it tries to move, once again, through our communities.<\/p> <p>  Last week, we learned something very important.  Thanks to the amazing efforts of the people of counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, we know that localised measures can work.  Without doubt, the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly have saved many lives.<\/p><p>They have saved lives in their own community.  By helping to suppress the spread of the virus around the country, they have saved lives all over Ireland.  For that we owe them a debt of gratitude.  We know that measures that avoid lockdown by seeking out and minimising the situations in which the virus spreads are what we now want to use.  That is the approach we are using across Ireland.  It involves targeted measures to suppress the virus while keeping as much of our society and our economy open as possible.<\/p><p> In the Department of Health we are preparing for the winter.  A comprehensive winter plan is being developed with many measures already in place.  As has been the case since the first day Covid-19 arrived in Ireland, Government decisions are informed by the recommendations and advice of NPHET, which monitors the evolving evidence in Ireland and around the world.  NPHET, in turn, is guided by the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  We are grateful for their assistance.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for this opportunity.

I am seeking that they will all stay open.  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been enhanced infection prevention and control, PPE, cleaning and disinfectant.  Part of his reasonable question is on how we increase bed capacity.  The other part is how we keep as many people as possible out of hospitals.  The clinical hubs are working well and we are looking for them to continue.  The mental health support desk has been working well and we are looking for that to continue.

In Cork a few years ago we had difficulty with a significant waiting list for gynaecological services.  A lot of them were day care procedures and space was rented in the Mater Private Hospital.

Is any provision being made whereby space can be rented in other medical facilities to allow, in particular, day care procedures to be dealt with?<\/p><p>What plan has been put in place in that regard?  Has there been engagement with the private sector in relation to getting space?  It is not necessarily about getting consultants in those facilities to do the work.

What is being done in that regard?<\/p><p> The second issue relates to consultant pay in the context of recruitment.  What progress has been made on that issue?

A support scheme for nursing homes is already in place.  I raised this matter with the HSE earlier and am seeking clarification, which could be set out in writing if necessary.  I seek information on the situation with regard to additional costs for nursing homes.  We must remember that they are caring for between 24,000 and 25,000 people.  Can I get clarification on that?<\/p><p> The final issue relates to the composition of NPHET and the fact that a sector that looks after over 25,000 people is not on NPHET.

In terms of the private hospitals a &euro;25 million bridging fund has been created and the HSE is using private hospital facilities right now, right across the system, based on medical priority.  Tenders have issued from now until Christmas and potentially beyond to all private hospitals.  We are tendering for diagnostics, services and surge capacity and I have no doubt that the example the Deputy gives of tendering for facilities but not necessarily for consultants is incorporated into the thinking on that.  I want to make sure that we avoid the situation we were in earlier this year, although I fully understand why it was done at the time, in the heat of moment in a full-blown crisis.  I am not criticising the action taken but it is clear that it did not work in terms of ongoing support, although it did work in terms of creating surge capacity very quickly.  I want to make sure we avoid the block purchase of resources that happened the last time.<\/p> <p>  In terms of consultants, a lot of progress has been made but let us remember that we have over 500 consultant vacancies right now.  We have one of the lowest levels of consultants per head of population in the OECD and if we are to get to a decent level, we will have to do an awful lot more than just fill the vacant posts.  C contracts have been signed off recently, which had not been done for quite some time.

If we do not get funding for the section 39 organisations I fear some of them will have to close.  <\/p><p> What is our roadmap for the GAA sports clubs, our wet pubs which have not yet opened, and our dance studios that have contacted us all?  They normally had 50 indoors, then 15 and six.  If we can deliver on legislation, information and testing, we could give people back the confidence they need.  We are doing well but we need to do a lot more.  We could make sure people know this is our message.  We are going to get over this and we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#WWW00400","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I will cover as many as I can and will get written responses for the Deputy if we do not get to them all.  With regard to testing and tracing, it is a key weapon in our arsenal.  We rank well by international standards.  The HSE has been ramping up very significantly.  We had approximately 52,000 tests or thereabouts last week.  One of the days last week saw the highest number of tests ever conducted in Ireland.  We have serial testing being rolled out in nursing homes, direct provision centres and meat processing plants.  There is a lot of community testing going on as well.  As the Deputy says, randomised testing will be introduced shortly to the airports.  With regard to schools, the public health advice is against that.  We are obviously led by the public health advice in that way.  If there is more information that can be provided to the public and the Oireachtas on an ongoing basis in terms of testing and tracing we will certainly endeavour to do that.  If the committee has views on that as to how we can be helpful, Chairman, please let me know.<\/p> <p>  On wet pubs - can we just call them pubs? - the public health advice is very clear.  Pubs cannot open right now.  I really do understand the pain, anguish and suffering that is causing for so many publicans and their staff around the country.  Based on public health advice and what is required to suppress this virus and avoid a second lockdown, that is the very clear position of the National Public Health Emergency Team.  They have said that restaurants can open.  It is not \"wet pubs\".  It is pubs and restaurants.  Some pubs are operating as restaurants at the moment, which is good and fine.  The international evidence is that we do not see a lot of clusters coming from restaurants, which is why the recommendation from NPHET was that they open.  However, it is my firm view that the moment it is deemed safe for the pubs to open, they need to open.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the GAA, I heard a lot of criticism from the GAA including singling out the acting Chief Medical Officer, which I have to say I take exception to.  The acting Chief Medical Officer's job is to advise me and Government.  His only focus is on saving lives.  The easiest thing in the world for NPHET would have been to advise us to just close down all sports.  We are at a tipping point, we could be looking at another national lockdown and we have to take this deadly seriously.  It would have been quite reasonable for NPHET to say for the next three weeks, in order to protect the country and lives, we simply have to stop sports.  To its great credit, it did not do that but recognised the incredibly important role sports play in our communities and for our country.<\/p><p>It said for that reason everyone can train and all matches can go ahead.  The advice it has is that playing of the matches and training is not where the virus spreading.  All it recommended was that for three weeks people did not spectate.  Obviously people can attend for child protection and safety reasons.  I hope that message is heard is by the amazing sporting institutions in this country, be it the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU and so on.  The public health advice was to protect these organisations and to protect sport and ask only that for a short period spectators not attend because the evidence is that there are cases associated with activity before and after training and matches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#XXX00200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#YYY00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending this session.  I compliment him and his staff on the work they are doing and I wish them well.  Taking the Kildare example, if the Minister was to identify a single issue that might have contributed to the upsurge in Kildare, what would it be?  Would it be a lack of attention to social distancing or, given that the pubs are not open and will not open in the near future, house parties or was it a lack of attention to hand hygiene and so on?  I would welcome a response from the Minister on that question.<\/p> <p>  Given that we are facing into the winter, and arising from the possibility that a single issue was a contributory factor in the recent outbreak in the midlands-Kildare and adjoining counties, can the Minister be certain of the ability of the system to deal with any further outbreaks that might occur in the community, in schools or adjacent to schools, in clusters or in meat factories and does it have the capacity to do so quickly?<\/p> <p>  A number of people have raised the question about the pubs.  I acknowledge what has been said.  In the absence of pubs as a social centre for the public there is a tendency for people to seek alternative locations that are not under any control.  What does the Minister say to the publicans who say they can achieve social distancing without any difficulty?  There will be some pubs that cannot do so but those that can are prepared to provide a service that is supervised as opposed to unsupervised and, as a result, safer places for social outlets for the public.  What does the Minister say to their submission?<\/p> <p>  My final point is in regard to the winter plan, special needs children and the ability to provide the necessary services for them, particularly in regard to children with autism.  There is strong evidence to suggest that owing to the lack of speech and language therapy, for example, their condition has deteriorated sharply.  To what extent can the Minister address that in the short to medium term and does he intend to do so?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#YYY00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.  The Deputy's first question, understandably, relates to what happened in Kildare and the reason for so many cases so quickly.  The advice I have is that it is a combination of factors, including high-risk workplaces in terms of Covid.  That is the experience in Ireland.  Nearly half of the workplace clusters to date, before this happened, had been in meat processing plants.  That is the experience around the world.  It is believed that travel may have played a part in terms of workers sharing commutes to and from work.  It is believed accommodation also played a part in terms of congregated settings.  When I ask the public health experts this question they are at pains to say that there are a lot of other unknown factors.  For example, there may have been a super-spreader or several super-spreaders but they do not know that.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that it is very important that in trying to identify what happened we do not lay blame anywhere.<\/p><p>The only thing to blame is a deadly virus and we are in the middle of a global pandemic.<\/p><p> Much good work was done in testing and tracing.  The committee has done good work in this area in its earlier sessions.  Due to the speed and significance of the number of additional cases in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the tracing time slowed down.  We need to ensure that it does not happen again.  It happened for an understandable reason, namely that front-line clinicians were deployed back to their jobs.  However, the tracing team is ramping up from about 50 or 60 around the time of the Kildare outbreaks to more than 150 by the end of the week.  As the schools go back and we seriously ramp up testing for meat processing plants, direct provision, nursing homes, and as our community testing is now high, our priority must be to maintain very high turnaround times.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#YYY00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>May I have written replies on the special needs supports for children and the winter plan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#ZZZ00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":609,"content":"<p>The next speaker is from the Green Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#ZZZ00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I have four questions which I will try to get through quickly in five minutes.  A colour coded alert system is being introduced as an alternative to the previously published roadmap for reopening.  Does the Department have a date for its publication?  What can the public expect from the system?  Will there be restrictions tied to specific colours and so on?<\/p> <p>  Second, data on hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections was released at the end of June.  There were 265 cases, so approximately 8% of all hospitalised Covid-19 cases.  The latest data from the health protection surveillance centre has identified 8,563 Covid-19 infections in healthcare workers which is about 31% of all Covid-19 cases.  As we move towards a potential second wave of Covid-19, what work is being done to reduce its spread within our healthcare facilities?  Will there be a lessons learned report on hospital-acquired infections and the high levels of Covid-19 infections among healthcare workers?<\/p> <p>  Third, how is the Department ensuring there will be minimal disruption to medical services in the event of a second wave?  Is the Department considering using the private hospitals as before?  Finally, at its Thursday 6 August meeting, NPHET discussed alternative testing pathways for children.  The standard nasopharyngeal specimen is upsetting and offputting for many children and their parents and guardians.  The alternative, less precise, oral fluid or saliva specimen was discussed in recognition of this being more appropriate for children.  Will the Department clarify if it has received recommendations from NPHET on alternative specimen types for testing children?  As we move closer to the reopening of schools, could the Department prioritise this?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#ZZZ00500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":611,"content":"<p>The colour coding system is a proposal from NPHET for consideration at Government level.  The Government is putting together the new detailed roadmap which will be available for debate and discussion in the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  Regardless of what is decided in the new roadmap, between now and Christmas we are in a new chapter.  The strategy is: follow the public health advice, suppress the virus to keep society and the economy open, use localised approaches where we can which, thanks to the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly, we know work, and critically target the measures at the areas and activities where we know the virus spreads in order to protect everything else in our society and the economy staying open.<\/p> <p>  On infections among healthcare workers, I agree the number looks very high.  Any infected healthcare worker is one too many.  There is no doubt but that the level of infection, prevention and control measures that are now in place were not in place previously.<\/p><p>That is not a criticism of the occupational help provided or of the amazing healthcare workers in our system.  It is a novel virus and it hit us quickly.  We had not dealt with anything on this scale before.  I assure the Deputy that very rigorous infection prevention and control measures are now in place.  However, we must never stop and say that enough has been done.  We have to keep going every day and week and we have to keep tightening up on the protections, not just for our healthcare workers but for our patients also, not just for those working in the nursing homes but for the residents also, and so on.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked an important question that weighs on my mind a lot, which is what happens to healthcare services if there is a second wave.  The short answer is that nothing good happens.  As we all know, before Covid-19 arrived, we had the longest healthcare waiting lists in Europe and the new information on how long they have become because of the elective care that had to be paused makes for sobering reading.  One of the reasons the winter plan we will propose is so comprehensive is in order that we will be able to deal with Covid-19, have surge capacity, get the healthcare system running to deal with day-to-day demand and, ideally, start looking at these waiting lists as well.  We will minimise the disruption to healthcare but we have to be clear that if we are dealing with a serious second wave of Covid-19 in this country, healthcare services will, for a second time, be severely curtailed.  That is why it is so important for us to get the message out that we are at a tipping point and that if we all comply with the healthcare advice from NPHET, as the people of counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly have shown, we can suppress the virus.  The best way we can all protect healthcare workers and the best thing we can do to make sure our hospitals and community settings stay open is to suppress the virus in the community.<\/p><p> I will get the Deputy a written response to her question about saliva tests.

When we asked the Minister to come to the committee a few weeks ago, he was unable to do so.  He is here now.  I am not sure if he is aware of this but he is the main event today, not just for the committee but for the people of Ireland who want to see a plan and some certainty.  The committee received a three-page opening statement, which was well spaced out with a lot of gaps, half an hour before the session began.  There is no submission or further detail, and even within these three pages - and a lot can be said within three pages - there is nothing that gives people any kind of clarity or guidance on what they will have to do until at least Christmas, to use the Minister's timeline.  That is deeply concerning.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about a winter plan a number of times today.  The chief executive of the HSE explicitly stated earlier that the HSE is not referring to a winter plan this year.  He pulled me up on that earlier and said the HSE was looking to manage its services through winter and into next year and that it is in a totally different realm.  I am wondering if the Minister and the HSE are even talking to each other.<\/p> <p>  In the Minister's opening statement, there is no mention of direct provision, meat plants or travel restrictions and how travel will work.  There is no mention of a roadmap either.  The Minister mentions Kildare, Laois and Offaly, which is quite disingenuous.  If Kildare, Laois and Offaly are to be the pilot system for what we will be doing between now and Christmas, I am deeply concerned.  The previous speaker asked about a roadmap and the Minister said a roadmap would be presented to the Oireachtas for discussion in the coming weeks.  How will that work?  Will we all thrash out a roadmap across the floor of the Oireachtas for a number of weeks before it is delivered?  It is up to the Minister, on the advice of NPHET, to deliver a roadmap so that we all have certainty.  We require leadership on this.  I am at a loss as to where we are going.<\/p> <p>  To take what little detail the Minister has provided, on the localised county-by-county approach, how would it work for a county such as Dublin?  God forbid there will be a big outbreak in Swords or Balbriggan.<\/p><p>Is the whole of Dublin city and county going to be closed down in that scenario?

Of the 5,608 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in nursing homes, only 422 patients were hospitalised.  As I said, it all makes for really grim reading.

We have to look at this now, not with the benefit of hindsight but with the benefit of understanding that what was done happened in a crisis the likes of which had not been seen before.  I am aware, as is the Deputy, of some very serious incidents, both in terms of individual nursing home residents and of very high mortality rates in particular homes.  As the Deputy said, the various agencies of the State have been looking very closely at what happened.  I am sure Deputy Kenny has seen the HIQA report which looked at the half of nursing homes that did not have Covid outbreaks and how prepared they were before the pandemic.  I have asked the authority to do the same report for the other 50% of facilities.  Most important, we have had the nursing home expert group report, which contained 86 recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I hope the Deputy agrees that the number one priority for us all right now is making sure everything that can be done to protect nursing home residents and staff is done.  The focus now is on what we have learned, what has worked well here, what has not worked well here, what has worked well in other countries and whether we are doing everything we can to protect the people most vulnerable to this awful virus.  At the same time, it is absolutely proper and essential that the families of the residents who have passed away or become very sick get full transparency as to what happened.  I do not believe that now is the time to start a public inquiry because we are focusing on keeping people safe.  However, I am most definitely open to the idea.

The short answer to the question on face coverings in financial institutions is \"Yes\", for the reasons the Deputy has outlined.  As I am sure the committee will appreciate, I want to avoid sounding like I am the Chief Medical Officer by providing direct public health advice.  I will do my best to paraphrase the advice of the acting Chief Medical Officer.  The advice is essentially to use extreme caution right now.  We know from the data that people who are more vulnerable to the virus, those over 70 or with underlying conditions, are being extremely careful.  We know that because as the number of cases has gone up and up, the number of fatalities, hospital admissions and intensive care unit admissions has thankfully remained stable and very low.  We know that people who are more vulnerable to this disease are already exercising their judgment very well and very effectively.<\/p> <p>  The message during this period, which will hopefully last just three and a half weeks, is to be even more careful.  What does that mean?  It means people should limit their number of social interactions and limit the number of people who come into their homes.  Shopping should be done during the times designated for more vulnerable people, if that facility is available.  If it is not, more vulnerable people should seek other ways to have shopping brought to their houses.  People have asked me if they can still go on their holidays in Ireland.  The answer is absolutely \"Yes\", but they should take all the precautions they would take at home.  Social interactions should be limited, face coverings should be worn and others should be asked to wear them and so on and so forth.  <\/p> <p>  This is not just up to people who are vulnerable.  It is up to everybody else as well.  We all have a role to play.  The Chief Medical Officer spoke passionately this morning about the need for solidarity.  The best way to protect people who are vulnerable to this disease is to suppress the disease in our community.  That means keeping our distance, limiting the number of people we meet with, washing our hands, wearing face coverings and following the other measures.  That is the message I want to send and which I hope everyone in this committee will relay.  We have to do this together and we can do it together.

The Minister was quoted as saying at a recent press conference that in one weekend 6,000 pubs were inspected and 26 were found to be non-compliant.  That can be compared with the meat plants.  There is one in my own home town of Cahir.  Only 39 inspections were carried out in meat plants and 30 of those were preannounced.  Those figures are stark.  They are the Minister's own figures.  Those pubs were inspected in a single weekend.  An Garda has enough to do without visiting pubs.  What does the Minister have against pubs?  They have not been found guilty of anything but they have been blackguarded and destroyed.<\/p> <p>  I refer also to dance schools, musicians and artists.<\/p><p>They are being left behind and crushed.  There is also the cohort of people with disabilities, especially those on the autism spectrum and special needs children.  They have really suffered and they are not fully back up and running yet.  Huge attention must be given to them, which is very challenging.  They must be supported because they need that. <\/p><p> There was a situation at Walsh Mushrooms in Golden.  Why is testing not done at the plant, given there is ample space, rather than going into the middle of a village and frightening people by setting up a camp there?  I salute everybody who did that and salute the community for its engagement.  There is further testing next Saturday but it should be done at the plant, where there is plenty of space away from the local village.  It puts fear into people when they see the Army and Garda arrive with the whole entourage.  The inspections are pretty stark.<\/p><p> There is also the whole situation regarding the treatment of publicans who have opened.  The Minister can call them what he likes today, and he can call them restaurants, but they are pubs.  Many of them do food and many are forced to do food because, apparently, the &euro;9 worth of food is better than any antidote or cure.  Food is the cure.<\/p><p> The Minister is giving out mixed messages, which are very wrong and very damaging.  I put it to him that he and the Taoiseach have dropped the ball since they took over.  I wished them well when they took over but they have dropped the ball and lost public confidence.  Some of that was due to the Minister's own response at a press conference where he equated the virus to children being on a trampoline or people driving a car.  Those are pretty silly things to say, or else the virus is not that serious.  It is one or the other, and the Minister might explain. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#GGGG00800","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Deputy McGrath asked whether we need more Health and Safety Authority inspections.  That is a question directly for the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, but I can give the Deputy my opinion as Minister for Health.  As we look at the meat processing plants and other high-risk areas, I want to see as many inspections as possible to make sure high-risk workplaces in particular are compliant with the protocols that have been put in place.  My preference is for unannounced inspections, for obvious reasons.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why the pubs are closed.  I share his frustration.  It is not fair for publicans around the country, and I know that.  The reality is we are dealing with a virus that is close to having us lock down the country again.  The public health advice is that we are at a tipping point and we are doing everything we can to suppress this virus to stop a second lockdown, get the schools open, which we now have, keep businesses open, protect jobs, get the hospitals open and so forth.  The public health advice and evidence are that in other countries, unfortunately, where the pubs have opened, they have been associated very quickly with outbreaks.  That is the reason.  I really do not want to be here saying that.  I would like nothing more than to be announcing, and hopefully I will as soon as possible be announcing, that they have to be reopened. <\/p> <p>  The same applies unfortunately to dance schools.  It is not about going after anybody; it is about trying to save lives.  The measures the Government has brought in for this three and a half week period are based on the evidence that the National Public Health Emergency Team has on where and how this virus spreads.  What it has found is that large indoor gatherings are one of the areas where this virus spreads, unfortunately.  In being able to target that, what we are able to avoid is much wider shutdowns because our experts know more about the virus than they knew four or five months ago.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with the Deputy on disability services, which are an absolute priority. <\/p> <p>  With regard to Golden, I want to respectfully push back.  The Deputy has made comments about why it was set up there and that people are intimidated by the Garda and the National Ambulance Service coming in.<\/p><p>What happened was that an outbreak was detected very quickly and the healthcare services of the State were deployed in Tipperary almost instantly.  All workers were sent home, isolated and tested.  As a result of this ability to move quickly and comprehensively, we have the best chance of stopping the virus from spreading into the community in Tipperary.  I understand the Deputy's questions and I know he is giving voice to the frustrations of the people he represents but on this particular issue I remind him that what happened in Tipperary was exactly what we have to see to suppress this virus, namely, the public health services working quickly and comprehensively to deal with the clusters as they emerge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#HHHH00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>The factory in Cahir ten miles away was not closed.

Deputy Cullinane and I had a conversation about this earlier.  The reduced capacity in terms of acute beds is reducing all the time.  The figure we were given initially was 20%.

It is closer to 40%, as the Deputy said, for some issues such as complex diagnostics and somewhat complex surgeries.

I acknowledge that in my time on the committee, the Deputy was a tireless advocate on exactly this question and making sure these measures were in place.<\/p> <p>  \"Yes\" is the short answer.  We have a useful report from HIQA, which examined half of nursing homes that did not have Covid outbreaks and assessed them under a wide variety of measures regarding their preparedness for a second wave.  I have written to HIQA and asked it to do the same for the other half.<\/p> <p>  We had a very comprehensive report from the nursing homes expert group.  They made 86 recommendations under 15 themes.  We launched it last week.  We have set up an implementation team, including the stakeholders that need to be involved.  They also have expert advice from people who were involved in writing the original report.  They will come back to me soon regarding the additional measures that need to be put in place.  The Government's goal is to make sure that everything that can be done is done for all nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  I believe the nursing home recommendations were superb.  Some were short-term.  In fact, we already have some of them in place.  There were medium-term ones.  They also took a look at the much broader questions around whether the regulation of care for older people in this country is good enough.  It is a point the Deputy has raised repeatedly.  The answer, of course, is, \"No, it is not.\"  They have also given us direction in terms of the work we must do in this Government to improve elder care, be it in nursing homes or in hospitals, or, of course, at home.  We have seen some striking figures for other countries, particularly in Scandinavia, in terms of the percentage of people who can live in their older years at home as opposed to going into nursing homes if they have the supports at home they should have, and which we want to take a close look at making sure happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#MMMM00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments.

As the Deputy said, one of the most important ways of doing that is to provide adequate home care hours.  An additional 2.6 million additional home care hours have been deployed and sanctioned.  In the winter plan, we will look at a considerable additional number and bulking up the multidisciplinary teams required to support people living at home.<\/p> <p>  We have to do everything we can this winter to make it unnecessary for people to go into hospital and what we are doing is providing as much home care as possible.

I welcome his comments.<\/p> <p>  Two issues that have upset me the most, most of my constituents and indeed most of the country.  One concerns the man and his stepson ,both of whom lived in Kilbrew nursing home and both of whom died.  We heard the appalling description of the maggots on the poor man's face and the way he was treated.  That case cries out for justice.  I understand the Minister is talking about other inquiries but I believe that he needs to appoint urgently a qualified professional to look into Kilbrew nursing home as a matter of extreme urgency.  I know there were other deaths there.  It requires a qualified person.  Professor Des O'Neill did the Leas Cross nursing home report some years ago.  It needs to be done.  What I understand happened at Kilbrew nursing home is absolutely unacceptable.  Part of the inquiry has to be into the correspondence between Sage Advocacy and HIQA.  There were three or four notices of concern issued to them directly about this family.  It is just appalling.<\/p> <p>  The second issue, which I asked about at this morning's session with the HSE, concerns the deaths in Dealgan House nursing home, which had the highest number of deaths in County Louth.  For three months, half of the deaths in the county were in Dealgan House.  Families are extremely upset.  A report was done by HIQA but they have not had sight of it.  They are not getting answers from the HSE or from the Department of Health.  In their view, there is obfuscation and delays.  They have spent hundreds of euro on freedom of information requests to try to get to the truth as to why the Department and HIQA, due to what they found, put the Royal College of Surgeons hospitals group in to run that nursing home.  These people have lost family members and are traumatised by their deaths.  They are deeply frustrated at the bureaucracy they have encountered.  I ask the Minister the same question I put to Mr. Paul Reid this morning.  Will he meet those families to listen to their issues?  Will he appoint a competent and qualified person to look specifically at what happened in that nursing home on the particular grounds that he, the Department and the HSE had put in a special team to manage the home?  One of the issues raised was that the majority of staff who worked there were unable to be on duty.  Patients died.  There is evidence that the HSE was aware of the fact that a significant number of workers were absent due to illness and other reasons, and while the executive gave assurances that it was acting, there was a delay of at least four or five days when a lot of people would have caught Covid-19 as a result.  It is a very serious issue and I would appreciate the Minister's comments on it please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#NNNN00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I know I am out of time but given the sensitivity of the topic I ask the Chairman if I can take a short bit of time to respond to the Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#NNNN00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#NNNN00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

When the invitation was issued 14 days ago, the meeting was scheduled to address the increased restrictions in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  Over the past 14 days, while it is disappointing that Kildare has not emerged from those restrictions, we have successfully managed the outbreak in those counties.  By allowing the public health experts to take the lead, we dealt with the virus as well as we could.<\/p> <p>  Over the course of the meeting, I have taken away two lessons.  The first was when I heard Mr. Paul Reid talking about us living with the virus and Dr. Ronan Glynn talking about how we can reopen sensibly.  The strategy we are now engaging in, which is not a zero-risk strategy, is based on the idea that we must allow our economy to reopen so that we can go to school, engage with our health service and protect jobs, but with the balance always on the side of public health.  If that is the case, the Minister's analogy of risk management, about which there has been some discussion, is actually a correct one.  An analogy I have used many times, although I hesitate to use an analogy again, relates to the first time one lets one's child walk to the shop.  One will never know when is the right time to do it.  It will inevitably involve risk but the parent knows that the child must be allowed to grow and gain independence.  Each time we go out into the world there are risks, and as we head into a world of living with the virus, that is what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  What we heard today, however, was the idea that while previously activities were judged on whether they allowed for social distancing and on the public health advice, we now seem to be moving into a different area where some activities, even though they allow for social distancing, are not permitted because they involve increased inter-household contact.  That brings us into a difficult territory where we are making judgments about what is a good or bad activity.  That is always a dangerous area for the Government to be involved in.  If we are to live with this virus for long periods, perhaps we would be better off guiding people to have a prescribed number of contacts or a prescribed level of social contact, and to allow them to apply it, whether they want to go to a football match where they can stand 2 m apart or whether they want to go for a meal in a restaurant where the distance is only 1 m.  Different people choose different things to do in their lives.  I worry that if we are to stay with this virus for long periods, we may end up in a difficulty where the State dictates what is a desirable activity.  I know that is not the intention at the moment as we unravel the advice, but if the virus is to be with us for several months, we will need to give more leniency and to get back to circumstances where people can more easily understand what is or is not permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#OOOO00500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":757,"content":"<p>On the issue of comparisons of risk, during a conversation about getting schools open, I made a comment about our need to manage risk.  I believe one of the examples I used caused a great deal of genuine hurt, anxiety and concern.  It was in my head, as it happens, because it was how one of my kids had recently broken an arm.  I was not for a moment suggesting that the risks were at all comparable.  Nevertheless, I understand that in an environment where people are very worried, it caused anxiety, and I certainly did not mean to add to anybody's anxiety.<\/p> <p>  If I might provide some good news in respect of the point the Deputy made about children, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland has just released its latest view on the impact of Covid-19 on children from a health perspective.<\/p><p>I will just read one paragraph, if I may.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt is clear now that fortunately the vast majority of children who get SARS-CoV 2 infection do not develop severe COVID-19 illness.  This also appears to be the case for children with underlying health problems, these children may get an infection with very few symptoms at all or they may experience an illness like, but usually no worse than, the seasonal flu.  Children who are immunocompromised, or taking immune medications for inflammatory conditions such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, also do not appear to have an increased risk from COVID-19.  <\/blockquote><p>We are all worried.  I am sending my own children back to school tomorrow.  There is, however, good, positive news emerging from the experts on this.<br\/><br\/>To address the Deputy's broader question on striking the right balance in managing the risk in society, we are all figuring this out as we go, as is every country.  It was put to me by medical experts regarding counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly that because of early detection and what we now know about the virus, we were able to bring in much less restrictive measures than the countrywide lockdown we saw.  The point was made to me by one expert that if that had happened four months ago, it would have spread into the whole country and we would have had to lock down the entire country.  If the first piece of good news is that the medical evidence on children is reassuring, the second piece is that we are learning every day about this virus and are now at a point where, as proven by the efforts of counties Laois, Kildare and Offaly and the people living there, targeted localised measures can work.<br\/><br\/>I suppose the Deputy is now asking the next question, which is whether we can be even more non-specific than that.  Perhaps, at this point, we have all internalised the guidelines, namely, to limit our social interactions, wear a face covering, obey social instancing and all the other measures we all now know.  The answer is, hopefully, in time, &quot;yes&quot;.  If chapter one was flattening the curve by locking down the country, we are now at the start of chapter two, which is suppressing the virus in a targeted way so the rest of society and the economy can function.  Perhaps, the Deputy is describing chapter three whereby it will become implicit in how we live, work and interact and that will be enough.<br\/><br\/>The expert view from NPHET is that we are not there at this point and based on the increasing number of cases in Ireland, the rate at which they are rising, the profile of those cases, which are in workplaces, homes and social settings, we are finely balanced in terms of a second wave right now.  If there is a second wave, the Government will have to consider the blunt instrument which we know works, that is, a lockdown.  We are doing everything we can to avoid that.  Certainly, the public health advice right now it is that targeted measures are needed.  I agree in spirit with what the Deputy is saying.  We have to trust people.  People know how to deal with this.  In some of the targeted measures we are specifically targeting areas where, perhaps, the level of compliance is not what it needs to be and maybe simply just trusting everybody to do the right thing is not enough.  We know, for example, there have been house parties and that they have been considerable vectors of this disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#OOOO00600","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Deputy Lawless wants to contribute for one and a half minutes.

I have explicitly asked the team to look at the profile of what is happening in Kildare and if there is a public health case to be made that it is the right thing to do and it is safe to accelerate the opening up, then that is exactly the recommendation I should get.

We also know that thanks to the incredible work of people in Kildare, that has been stopped and is now being reversed.  The seven-day rates are much lower.  This is a very difficult call for NPHET to make because while the measures are working, the question is whether they have reduced community transmission to a point where it is safe to relax the restrictions.  We know the restrictions are working and inevitably, there will be risk of community transmission spiralling again if they are relaxed too early.  I salute what the people of Kildare have done and I deeply empathise with the fact that they are now the only county being asked to comply with additional measures.  If the restrictions can be lifted early, based on public health advice, they most certainly will be but we need to be very clear that our absolute focus is on saving lives, which is what the people of Kildare have done, getting the schools open, keeping businesses and our health care services open and avoiding much harsher measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#QQQQ00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

At the beginning of this we were told that the strategy was to flatten the curve.  We were told that the virus would spread, as viruses do but that we needed to flatten the curve to ensure that our health system was not overrun and we did not have scenes like those in Italy and Spain.  At the time that the restrictions were introduced, numbers were rising from 170 in hospital to 440, from 50 in ICU to 80.  Four months ago on 29 April there were 1,185 cases in hospital in Ireland, of which 120 were in critical care units.  Three times today the Minister told us that we were looking at a complete lockdown and that we were at a tipping point.  We have been hearing a lot about tipping points.  We have heard about tipping points since June.  We were also told today by the HSE that 22 patients were admitted to hospital with Covid-19, six of whom are in ICU.  I accept that for those 22 patients and their families and particularly for the six patients in ICU and their families, this is an incredibly worrying and stressful time but what I do not understand is how the Minister can possibly talk about a national lockdown given those figures and given that our health system coped with 1,185 cases four months ago.<\/p> <p>  What is the strategy here?  What are we hoping to achieve, if not that our health system is not overrun?  I note that earlier this week Dr. Glynn accepted that we cannot eliminate the virus.  That seems to be the general consensus.  I accept that there are some who are calling for it to be eliminated but Dr. Glynn said that he does not think we can eliminate it here.  There is a growing acceptance that we cannot eliminate it and even if we do, what do we do then?  We open up and we go through the same cycle.  The Minister talked about lockdowns and said a couple of times that they work but Argentina has been in a lockdown for six months and its figures are spiralling.<\/p><p>Earlier this week we heard Dr. Hans Kluge, the European director of the World Health Organization, on RT&Eacute; news saying that lockdowns do not work.

It is not me making that up.  I am saying it because that is NPHET's position.  It is natural that we all become fatigued with this.  People have been through an awful lot.  The reason I am emphasising and re-emphasising it is that we need to be on our guard.  In terms of the Chairman's question about whether lockdowns work, we know they work.  We did one here and it worked.  They did them across Europe and they worked.  If the purpose is to flatten the curve, we locked the country down and the curve was flattened.

I regret each and every one of them desperately.  I lost a very close relative earlier this year and I know that no matter what age somebody is, we do not want to lose somebody close to us.  We are talking about national priorities.  We have six people in ICU and 22 in hospital with Covid-19.  At the height of this we had 1,100 people in hospital and 120 in ICUs yet the Minister is talking about a lockdown again.  Has he any idea of the effect that is having?  Forget about the economy for a moment.  We cannot forget it about it for too long because something has to fund our healthcare system.  They do not fund themselves in any country in the world.  Has the Minister any idea what effect it is having on mental health, on people's psyches and spirits?  How can he possibly talk about a lockdown given the figures?  It flies in the face of reason.

I think the Chair's question is fair.  The number of cases is going up and we know it is going up very quickly.

Let us be very clear that this virus is rising again quickly in our community.  The Chair has very fairly asked how that is linked to hospitalisations.  The cases are high but the hospitalisations, thank God, are low.  Go back and look at the profile at what happened the first time, and what you will find is that at this point in the pattern, as the cases were around where they are now and rising rapidly, hospitalisations were also very low.  The unambiguous message and advice from public health is that death will follow high numbers of cases.

I refer the Chairman to the profile that happened here in March and April.  If we were back in March and April, we could well be having exactly this conversation.  The Chairman could be saying that case numbers are increasing but hospitalisations have not happened at a big level and, therefore, asking whether we need a lockdown to flatten the curve.  As we all know, we have had nearly 1,800 deaths.  The answer is that what we did was necessary.<\/p> <p>  There are no easy answers.  We are moving early to stop the fatalities, the critical care admissions and the hospitalisations.  I emphasise again that the success of Kildare, Laois and Offaly is that the communities there have shown that relatively reduced measures in comparison with a lockdown not only work, but work very quickly.  That is simply what we are doing.  I am more than happy to remain here for as long as the Chairman wants and to answer any questions but I would like to make one ask and to make a further point.  Speed matters.  How fast we moved in the three counties in question mattered, and how fast we are moving in terms of the national measures matters a great deal.  Critically, how quickly individuals respond matters.  There has been, rightly, a lot of focus in the committee on the turnaround time for testing.  We will continue to reduce it.  The other part is individual responsibility.  My ask is that if people feel symptomatic, they do not do what we all do in the normal world and wait a few days to see if they improve but instead go immediately to their GPs.<\/p> <p>  If we all act and move early by going to our GPs to request a test if we have one of the symptoms, and if we follow the public health guidelines around social distancing, face coverings and so on, we will move through this crisis without the harsher measures, which is exactly what we are trying to achieve.  We obviously have to reopen our schools but in my brief we have to get the healthcare system to a higher capacity that existed before because of the enormous number of men, women and children waiting for healthcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020082600002#SSSS00700","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1598396400,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I note that in the coming days the Minister will provide the committee with the figures on how that capacity is to be increased and I thank him for that.
