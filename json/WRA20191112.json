Ireland is a signatory of the Stockholm Declaration of the International Forum on the Holocaust, and is a member of the Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.

Successive Governments in Ireland and globally, and public representatives, NGOs and individuals, have voiced strong criticisms of Israel&rsquo;s policies in the occupied Palestinian territory. I have done so myself. It is to be expected that any country which is engaged in a military occupation of another people will be subject to a particularly high level of scrutiny. Criticisms of the occupation are not based on anti-Semitism or hostility to Israel, but on consistently applied values of respect for justice, human rights and the rule of law. There are of course many Israelis who criticise Israel&rsquo;s occupation policies.<\/p>  <p>  Criticism of Israeli Government policy is not in itself anti-Semitic, and to conflate these things is unjust, counter-productive, and potentially damaging. Conflating valid criticism of Israeli actions with anti-Semitic attitudes, risks unfairly stigmatising people who are motivated by a desire for justice for the Palestinians, and blunting the reflex of horror we should all have at real manifestations of anti-Semitism. Conversely, I also believe it is wrong when criticism of Israeli Government actions conflates the Jewish people &ndash; globally or in Ireland &ndash; with the Government of Israel.<\/p>  <p>  EU leaders must be vigilant against anti-Semitism, given our continent&rsquo;s history. We consider Israel a partner. That has never prevented us criticising actions by the Israeli Government, particularly in relation to the occupation, rooting our criticism in values which we pursue consistently and globally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200056#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200056#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[46429\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200056#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to attacks by Turkey on civilians in northern Syria (details supplied); and if his Department is providing humanitarian assistance in the area.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>Ireland is deeply troubled by Turkey&rsquo;s unilateral military action in Syria, which has severely destabilised the region.

The report concludes that States carry the primary responsibility for ensuring that indigenous peoples are able to safely exercise their rights, and that accountability is established for violations against indigenous communities and defenders. The report also highlights the necessity to engage in genuine, free and informed consultation with communities prior to development. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has called on a number of occasions for States, including Brazil, to ensure full accountability for any violence, harassment or intimidation of civil society, indigenous or environmental activists exercising their rights to freedom of expression, and for the respect of indigenous communities' rights. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that call.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland used the occasion of the 27th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 5 May 2017 to express our concern at the reported regression in the protection of indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights in Brazil. Ireland recommended that Brazil take further steps to protect human rights defenders, including those working on the rights of indigenous peoples, by ensuring impartial, thorough and effective investigations into all cases of attacks, harassment and intimidation and the prosecution of all alleged perpetrators of such offences.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to raising these issues at multilateral level, officials of my Department at home and at our Embassy in Bras&iacute;lia engage regularly with human rights activists and civil society leaders in Brazil and across Latin America, including those working on the rights of indigenous communities.

It notes that, in the last year alone, paramilitaries have been linked to three horrific murders, a number of attacks on the PSNI and scores of paramilitary-style assaults.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission recognise that continued paramilitarism is profoundly de-stabilising in Northern Ireland and, as long as this persists, peace and reconciliation will be much more difficult to achieve. It is against this backdrop that the IRC calls for a renewal of urgency around efforts to bring paramilitarism to an end &ndash; in the words of the Fresh Start Agreement &ndash; &ldquo;once and for all&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The IRC reiterates its view from its First Report of 2018 that the twin-track approach, first pre-figured in the Fresh Start Agreement itself, remains the key to tackling paramilitarism. The twin-track approach is an holistic approach that combines a policing and justice response side-by-side with a comprehensive addressing of the systemic, socio-economic issues facing communities where paramilitaries operate.  <\/p>  <p>  The Report also notes the extent and effectiveness of the co-operation between the authorities in both jurisdictions on this island.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission's report makes clear that there are a range of areas where the full and effective implementation of the Executive&rsquo;s Action Plan for Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime &ndash; which flowed from the Fresh Start Agreement &ndash; is hampered by the absence of an Executive in Northern Ireland.

On 7 November, the HRVP issued a statement on behalf of the EU deploring the excessive use of force against protestors in recent weeks. The EU has been clear that all perpetrators of violations of the right to peaceful assembly must be held to account. The EU is ready to support the Government of Iraq in its work to address the citizen&rsquo;s demands, such as an end to corruption, improved governance and job creation.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in Lebanon is being carefully monitored and has been discussed among EU colleagues at official level. On 25 October, the HRVP issued a statement on behalf of the EU reiterating solidarity with Lebanon and recognising that the fight against corruption and the implementation of reform measures are of great importance. We appreciate the overall non-violent nature of the protests and that restraint has been applied by security forces. <\/p>  <p>  The ongoing demonstrations in Algeria were discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in April.

Ireland has disbursed &euro;5 million to UNRWA so far this year and we are in the process of releasing a further &euro;2m in funding. <\/p>  <p>  During that week, the Middle East Peace Process and the situation in the Occupied Palestinian territory was also an important theme in the meetings undertaken by senior Irish officials, for example in a meeting with the EU Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process Ms. Susanna Terstal.  <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to do everything I can to ensure Ireland can influence the political debate with the aim of resolving the conflict and bringing to an end the Israeli occupation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200057#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":62,"content":"<p>Question No. 69 answered with Question No. 50.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200057#WRB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[46255\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200057#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will follow the lead of other states by calling on Myanmar to be brought before the International Court of Justice for genocidal actions against the Rohingya; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Gambia has just yesterday submitted an application to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging breaches of the Genocide Convention by Myanmar.  <\/p><p>Ireland remains deeply concerned over the findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (IIFFM), and other special mandate holders regarding gross human rights violations committed by the Myanmar Military Forces (Tatmadaw), many of which amount to the gravest crimes under international law.<\/p><p>These include a finding by the IIFFM that there is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine State<i>.<\/i>Ireland, together with our EU partners, has consistently called for the accountability of those who may be responsible for such crimes and has engaged in a number of actions at international level in this regard. <\/p><p>The EU has also worked with international partners, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, to press for action at UN level including acting as pen-holder on several key initiatives.

Officials from my Department based in Belfast have engaged with the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Department of Justice in relation to this issue. <\/p>  <p>  The NI Department of Justice Prison Population report from September 2019 notes that the proportion of prisoners on remand has increased annually over the past number of years, with 30.1% of prisoners being on remand in the 2018\/2019 financial year. This follows on from an NI Audit Office report published in March 2018 which showed that there are significant delays in delivering justice in Northern Ireland. The average length of time from the reporting of a crime to completion of Crown Court proceedings is 515 days, which is twice as long as in England and Wales. The report found that the progress of cases through the system is punctuated by practices and processes that are not efficient and that work against the timely delivery of justice. The report also notes the detrimental impact this has on victims, defendants and witnesses. <\/p>  <p>  A number of recommendations were made in the NI Audit Office report which would shorten the time spent on remand, including the removal of the committal process. Implementing such reforms would require a locally elected Justice Minister to be in place as part of a restored Executive, which is an immediate priority of the Government. <\/p>  <p>  There is widespread acknowledgement across the justice system in Northern Ireland that the existing processes need to be reformed and speeded up. The most recent report of the Independent Reporting Commission noted this, where they expressed concern that the efforts of the PSNI in tackling paramilitarism are hampered by the committal process and the delays which it causes.

In addition, we are not persuaded that the continued embargo is contributing in a positive way to a democratic transition in Cuba. <\/p>  <p>  Recent developments on this issue have related to the US&rsquo;s Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to internationalise aspects of the US&rsquo;s embargo and penalise non-US citizens or entities that engage in economic activity with Cuba.

This year the campaign is promoting awareness of the Met &Eacute;ireann Severe Weather Warning Systems with an associated leaflet on their colour coded warnings that further explains how these are used.<\/p><p>The Office of Emergency Planning in my Department chairs the GTF Subgroup on Winter Preparedness, which meets regularly throughout the year to plan for and review each &ldquo;Be Winter Ready&rdquo; campaign. The OEP also has an annual presence at the National Ploughing Championships, which offers an opportunity to further promote the campaign ahead of the official launch by myself and other Ministers in early November each year. The OEP and the GTF review the effectiveness of each campaign annually and plan for the theme and context for the next launch.<\/p><p>The &ldquo;Be Winter-Ready&rdquo; annual campaigns have been incorporated into an overall whole of Government approach to winter preparedness across all Government Departments and the wider public service. In the context of expenditure, the costs of the campaign have been kept to a minimum and other Departments are working together and utilizing existing promotional mechanisms and budgets to present their contributions.

As outlined in the response to the previous PQ you mention, I am aware of the difficult situation that exists for human rights defenders in Colombia, and continue to reject the use of threats, including death threats, intimidation and violence against those exercising and protecting their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. <\/p>  <p>  Since opening earlier this year, our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has followed the situation in La Guajira closely and has maintained regular contact with all relevant stakeholders in order to gain a greater understanding of the circumstances and issues raised by the Deputy. Taking into account security and other considerations, a visit by the Embassy to the Department of La Guajira, where the Cerrej&oacute;n mine is located, was possible in late September 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The two-day visit took place on 23 and 24 September and was led by Ireland's Ambassador to Colombia, Ms Alison Milton. The programme included a tour of the mine itself, which was also attended by NGOs and local-community groups, as well as meetings with all stakeholders involved with the Cerrej&oacute;n mine, including Cerrej&oacute;n management, local communities, local government, religious leaders, academics and NGOs, including the local human rights group Fuerzas Mujeres Wayuu. <\/p>  <p>  The La Guajira region has a near-majority indigenous population (over 40% compared to 3.4% nationally), the largest of which is the Wayuu people, who number around 270,000 and for whom the exploitation of La Guajira&rsquo;s natural resources is a major grievance as they maintain a deep spiritual and ancestral connection to the land. It is also one of Colombia&rsquo;s poorest regions, where the needs of local communities are acute. <\/p>  <p>  The mine generates almost half of the region&rsquo;s income and is one of its largest employers providing over 13,000 jobs. While the mine owners attest to their compliance with local and international standards, challenges exist in relation to local governance, leading to a lack of trust between the local authorities, local communities and the mine. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy has reported on the range and complexity of issues, not least evolving public opinion in relation to the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels, and concluded that efforts should be made to improve communication between the local communities and the mine, and to include the local community in plans for closure of the mine by 2033. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy will hold meetings with national Government, with national and international NGO partners, and with Cerrej&oacute;n management in order to share feedback on the visit. Some of these meetings have already taken place.<\/p>  <p>  The Embassy will also continue its engagement on this issue with the EU delegation in Bogot&aacute;. The EU Delegation has visited the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in order to hear stakeholders&rsquo; views and maintains regular contact with representatives of sectoral trade unions and other civil society and environmental organisations.  The EU Human Rights subgroup also visited the area and met with local communities in February of this year.  <\/p>  <p>  Having a presence on the ground in Colombia has greatly enhanced Ireland's ability to engage on and monitor important issues, among them those raised by human rights, environmental and indigenous rights defenders, not least the impact of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine on the local community and the environment.<\/p>  <p>  The situation of human rights in the country is closely tied to the implementation of the peace agreement. Ireland supports the Colombian Government&rsquo;s full implementation of these accords. We also aim to continue our financial support to the peace process and to deepen our lesson-sharing programmes, based on our experiences of peacebuilding and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that officials in my Department in Dublin and at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; will continue to monitor the human rights situation in La Guajira and across Colombia.

The country reports assessed both Serbia and Montenegro as having both made progress over the past year, but there remain areas for improvement.

The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo noted that the political situation in Kosovo remains challenging.

It will be some time before Kosovo can qualify as a candidate country. <\/p><p>North Macedonia and Albania have been candidate countries since 2005 and 2014, respectively. The Commission&rsquo;s report in May recommended opening negotiations with both countries. North Macedonia has made significant progress in implementing the reforms recommended by the European Council in 2018, and the ratification of the Prespa Agreement shows that even the most difficult bilateral disputes in the region can be resolved.

As well as a committment to the humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence, humanity and impartiality, Ireland is firmly committed to directing our funding to those in greatest need.

Over the past number of years Ireland has taken on some key leadership roles in the international humanitarian system.

I raised the Israel-Palestine conflict in my meetings with a range of interlocutors, including the Secretary General of the League of Arab States. I also met with senior White House advisor Jared Kushner to discuss the Middle East Peace Process and the situation in the region.

The report concluded that Bosnia-Herzegovina needs to significantly step up the process to align with the acquis. The Commission set out 14 recommendations in the areas of democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights, and public administration reform that need to be implemented before the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered. Ireland is committed to supporting the country on its reform path and towards alignment with the EU, and we will continue to support all of the six Western Balkans countries on their path towards Europe. <\/p>  <p>  On Turkey, the Commission noted that there has been continued backsliding on the rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy, and that Turkey&rsquo;s accession negotiations have effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing. The Turkish Government&rsquo;s repeated commitment to the objective of EU accession has not been matched by corresponding measures and reforms, and the EU&rsquo;s serious concerns on continued negative developments have not been addressed. However, it should be noted that Turkey remains a key partner for the EU, particularly in relation to migration. Ireland therefore does not support the notion that the EU should withdraw Turkey&rsquo;s candidate status or formally suspend accession negotiations. Continued engagement with Turkey in the accession context is in the interests of both Europe and the Turkish people. However, Turkey needs to begin to re-engage constructively with the EU, and also with the Council of Europe in relation to human rights and basic freedoms, in order for the accession process to be set back on the right path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200059#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid Provision","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200059#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[46613\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200059#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which financial commitments made by the international community in respect of aid to various disaster areas has improved over the past ten years, particularly in the areas of co-ordination and delivery of such commitments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The past decade has seen a sharp increase in the level of humanitarian need globally, mainly due to conflict.

Conflict is the most significant driver of this increased need. <\/p>  <p>  Reducing humanitarian need is one of the four key priorities in Ireland's new development policy, A Better World. Ireland prioritises the provision of needs based, principled humanitarian aid to high profile humanitarian crises such as Syria but also to &lsquo;forgotten crises&rsquo; which receive less attention such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and Sudan. Over 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding in 2018 was directed in support of those affected by conflict.<\/p>  <p>  Critical to maximising Ireland&rsquo;s response is our strong and enduring commitment to effective multilateralism, particularly through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations.  Ireland is a strong contributor to efforts to prevent and to resolve conflict, prevent genocide, and eliminate the abuse of women and children. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts. Ireland has maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958, and has more than 570 personnel in United Nations mandated missions overseas.  The Government is committed to participation in peace-keeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security.  This commitment informs Ireland&rsquo;s decision to seek election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the period 2021-22.  If elected, membership of the Security Council would allow Ireland to play an important influencing role in the international response to the needs of the most vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  The Women, Peace and Security Agenda recognises the unique impact of conflict on women and girls and the importance of their full equal and meaningful participation in decision-making at all stages of peace-building and in sustaining peace. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Ireland's commitment to supporting peacebuilding and conflict resolution efforts around the world, Ireland is a strong supporter of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. Ireland has already implemented two National Action Plans on WPS: (NAP1 2011-2014) and NAP 2 (2015-2018). Ireland's third National Action Plan launched on 21 June 2019, renews and strenghtens this commitment. <\/p>  <p>  Next year marks the 20th anniversary of UNSCR 1325 and there is a push internationally for UN Member States to increase their work in this area and to move from rhetoric to the reality around the implementation of national action plans and the inclusion of women in peace processes.

(PFT) of up to &euro;2.3 million where the capital value of their pension rights as of 1 January 2014 exceeded &euro;2 million, but eligible individuals had to apply for a PFT before 31 July 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Public service pension schemes are treated for SFT purposes in the same way as all &ldquo;defined benefit&rdquo; (DB) pension schemes which provide for a lump sum that is accrued separately to the individual&rsquo;s pension (rather than providing for possible conversion or &ldquo;commutation&rdquo; of part of the pension to a lump sum).\u00a0 Account is also taken of the fact that part of the individual&rsquo;s pension fund would have accrued prior to 1 January 2014, before which date the SFT was higher.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The way the fund is calculated for public servants (and other members of DB pension schemes with lump sums separate from pensions) is best illustrated by way of an example. \u00a0For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that the individual has not had a previous &ldquo;benefit crystallisation event&rdquo; as defined in paragraph 2 of Schedule 23B TCA (which includes a pension the individual is already receiving), and does not have a PFT.<\/p>  <p>  If an individual retires on 1 January 2020 at age 60 years, gets a pension on retirement of &euro;100,000 - &euro;80,000 of which is deemed to have accrued up to 1 January 2014 (the &ldquo;specified date&rdquo;) and the balance of which (&euro;20,000) is deemed to have accrued after that date - plus a lump sum on retirement of &euro;300,000, the capital value of the individual&rsquo;s pension fund for SFT purposes is the sum of<\/p>  <p>  -  The amount accrued up to the &ldquo;specified date&rdquo; (&euro;80,000) multiplied by the &ldquo;relevant valuation factor&rdquo; on that date (20), which equals &euro;1,600,000, plus<\/p>  <p>  -  The amount accrued after the &ldquo;specified date&rdquo; (&euro;20,000) multiplied by the &ldquo;relevant age-related factor&rdquo; provided in the table to Schedule 23B TCA (30 for age 60 years) which equals &euro;600,000, plus<\/p>  <p>  -  The amount of the lump sum, which is &euro;300,000.<\/p>  <p>  The total capital value of the pension fund for SFT purposes for this individual is therefore &euro;1,600,000 plus &euro;600,000 plus &euro;300,000, which equals &euro;2,500,000.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The pension on retirement for the purposes of the calculation is the annualised equivalent of the amount paid on retirement &ndash; any adjustments in the first year (for example, increases in the pension) are ignored.\u00a0 The &ldquo;relevant valuation factor&rdquo; for the specified date (1 January 2014) is 20, while the &ldquo;relevant age-related factor&rdquo; ranges from 37 for those who retire at age 50 years or younger to 22 for those who retire at age 70 or over.\u00a0 For this &ldquo;split&rdquo; calculation to apply, the pension fund administrator must be satisfied that an &ldquo;accrued pension amount&rdquo; (that is, pension rights accrued before 1 January 2014) arises for the DB pension in question.<\/p>  <p>  For public servants and anyone whose pension fund exceeds the SFT (or the PFT, if applicable) the balance over the threshold, which is called the &ldquo;chargeable excess&rdquo;, is subject to &ldquo;chargeable excess tax&rdquo; at the higher rate of income tax, currently 40%. \u00a0To return to the example, that individual had a chargeable excess of &euro;500,000 (&euro;2,500,000 minus the SFT of &euro;2,000,000) so the chargeable excess tax due at 40% is &euro;200,000.<\/p>  <p>  No reliefs, allowances or deductions may be set against the chargeable excess when calculating the tax due.\u00a0 In certain cases, standard rate lump sum tax may be offset against tax due on a chargeable excess.<\/p>  <p>  The administrator of the public service pension fund will pay the chargeable excess tax due, which is recoverable from the individual.\u00a0 The legislation outlines a variety of ways in which the tax can be reimbursed by the individual to the administrator, depending on the amount to be reimbursed - by reducing the lump sum, by direct payment by the individual, or by reducing the individual&rsquo;s pension over a period not exceeding 20 years, or a permitted combination of these methods.\u00a0 The legislation also provides for cases where a pension adjustment order applies.<\/p>  <p>  There is an &ldquo;encashment option&rdquo;

For this reason, an alternative measure known as modified GNI (GNI*) has been developed by the CSO, which excludes the globalisation effects that can distort measurements of Irish output. These effects relate to the imports of R&amp;D, trade in intellectual property, net factor income of re-domiciled multinational enterprises and features of the aircraft leasing sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the OECD BEPS process has achieved much in curtailing aggressive tax planning. However, as mentioned by Mr Setser, this very success has been a factor in encouraging companies to move assets out of zero tax jurisdictions to places, such as Ireland, where they have real substantive operations, and this has contributed to some of the distortions in our national accounts.<\/p>  <p>  While much has been achieved, I recognise that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed. <\/p>  <p>  My officials and I continue to engage positively in the discussions at the OECD, and I remain open to solutions which respect our right to compete fairly and which respect the legitimacy of Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Application","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE00700"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[46246\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the quarter of the percentage point reduction in USC as agreed in budget 2018 applies to a person (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>Section 531AN of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides for a reduced Universal Social Charge (USC) rate of 2% on all income above &euro;12,012, where a person&rsquo;s total income in a year does not exceed &euro;60,000 and where the person is aged 70 or over or holds a full medical card.

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither I as Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  In May last year, the OPW completed the most extensive and comprehensive study on flood risk through the National Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme which identified the flooding risk to 300 communities. The Flood Risk Management Plans prepared under the CFRAM Programme identify 118 flood relief schemes in addition to the 35 flood relief projects that are already in design and development under the existing capital programme.<\/p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. This it believes should in turn lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  -  prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  <\/p>  <p>  -  implementation of flood relief management plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and   <\/p>  <p>  -  maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.  <\/p>  <p>  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme to be delivered by the OPW and Local Authorities, and complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The nature of this arrangement is that, overall, there has been an increase in the provision of flood insurance cover observed in areas protected by these schemes over the period 2015 to 2019, according to Insurance Ireland Flood Survey Results. <\/p>  <p>  I have not discussed the issue of flooding in Dublin 3 directly with Insurance Ireland. However, my officials are in regular contact with both Insurance Ireland and the OPW regarding proposed and completed flood defence schemes around the country and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed.<\/p>  <p>  You should also note that I have been advised by the OPW that in relation to the schemes located in Dublin 3 (The Tolka - East Wall Scheme, the Tolka - Hawthorne Terrace Scheme, and elements of the Tolka - Richmond Road Scheme) that all have been built to the 1\/100 year standard, and that information in relation to these schemes has been shared with Insurance Ireland under the Memorandum of Understanding.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance ((01 676 1914 or feedback@insuranceireland.eu).  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade in Tobacco","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE04000"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[46532\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the loss of earnings of retailers through the illegal importation and selling of tobacco products, which becomes more prevalent with duty increases on such products as was the case in budget 2020; and the way in which he can ensure that legitimate retailers are not undercut.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>There is a long-standing commitment by successive Governments to use taxation along with other measures as an instrument to discourage smoking, particularly amongst younger people.  This policy has been broadly successful.  The Government&rsquo;s Healthy Ireland strategy has set a target that 5% of the population or less would be smokers by 2025. According to HSE figures, the rate of smoking in Ireland fell to 18% of the adult population as of June 2018, down from 28% in 2003.   <\/p>  <p>  High taxation levels create an incentive for tobacco smuggling but tackling this problem is a high priority for Revenue.  An annual survey conducted by IPSOS MRBI in 2018 on behalf of Revenue and the HSE&rsquo;s National Tobacco Control Office found that 13% of cigarettes consumed in the State were illicit.  This compares to a survey estimate of 13% for 2017 and 10% for 2016.  However, the 2018 estimate of 13% is reduced from the comparable estimate in 2011 of 15%.   <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has indicated to me that they use a range of measures deigned to identify and target those involved in the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting the persons involved. Revenue&rsquo;s strategy involves developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work together on an ongoing basis in acting against tobacco crime, and both organisations cooperate closely with their Northern Ireland counterparts, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this form of criminality. In addition, Revenue works closely with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud office, Europol and other international organisations, including the World Customs Organisation, in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat tobacco crime. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s extensive ongoing programme of work against the illegal tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success. During the period 2016 to end-August 2019, 157.8 million cigarettes and 7.826 tonnes of roll your own tobacco were seized. In addition, 104 tonnes of raw tobacco were seized when two illicit cigarette factories were discovered in Co. Louth in 2018 and 2019. There were 123 convictions for tobacco-related offences in the period from January 2018 to September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has ensured through the Finance Acts over recent years that Revenue has the necessary statutory powers to tackle the illicit tobacco trade. I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for this important work but I am open to considering any proposals for further changes that Revenue may bring forward in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE04300"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[46596\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200060#WRE04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) regarding a proposal for the Revenue Commissioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>In general, an accountable person who supplies taxable goods or services to another accountable person is obliged under VAT legislation to issue a VAT invoice which includes the VAT payable on the supply.

This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.\u00a0 This\u00a0reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. NEPS psychologists are afforded a degree of flexibility in responding to need as it presents in their allocated schools.<\/p>  <p>  By way of clarification NEPS psychologists are assigned schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, DEIS status, gender mix, special class occurrence and geographical spread and equating roughly to a 5,000:1 pupil to psychologist ratio.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019 the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e. Some 197 of these posts are currently filled which represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000. The filling of the remaining posts is being actively pursued by my Department in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service and a number of new appointments are imminent. <\/p>  <p>  I would advise therefore, if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any child, that these should be raised by parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school concerned, with a view to that Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200062#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200062#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[46229\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200062#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when he plans to roll out the school inclusion model nationally in view of the fact schools outside of the 75 schools in the pilot programme have lost SNAs and have not benefited from in-school support.","asker":"1238","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>On 27<sup>th<\/sup>March I announced the trialling of the School Inclusion Model, a new model of support for students with special educational and additional care needs, which is being piloted in 75 schools in the Kildare\/Wicklow\/South Dublin region\u00a0in the current\u00a0school year.<\/p><p>The School Inclusion Model aims to build schools&rsquo;

This will provide increased choices for students, an enhanced student experience and greater access for potential students tackling educational disadvantage with TUs offering a broad range of teaching from apprenticeship to doctoral degrees. They will also support an increased intensity of research activity which will provide increased opportunities for collaboration with industry and deliver benefits for the economy and wider society. TUs will marry both an attractive physical multi-campus presence with state-of-the-art digital connectivity, providing new modes of learning where the student and learner is placed centre-stage and can access course content and avail of first-class tuition irrespective of location or circumstance. Each TU will serve as an anchor institution in the development and advancement of its region.

This state change is to be achieved through the connectedness, particularly at regional level, collaboration and connectivity of TUs and their unique delivery of programmes across the full range of the National Framework of Qualifications. The report makes a series of 12 recommendations for outcomes that will provide TUs with a solid foundation for their development. These centre upon three thematic areas identified by TURN as the essential building blocks for successful TUs : - <\/p><p>- investment in integrated multi-campus digital infrastructure to provide regional cohesion and to facilitate new modes of learning and the prioritisation of capital investment in TUs;<\/p><p>- investment in research capacity building by developing researcher human capital, facilitating research activity and opportunities for existing academic staff and implementing a researcher career development and employment framework, addressing infrastructural deficits and prioritising research strategies within TUs, exploiting fully the mutually supporting roles of teaching and research; and<\/p><p>- realignment of the policy framework and funding for TUs including an expansion of institutional autonomy and reform through the implementation of TU-apposite career structures, the reform of the grant allocation model to accommodate TUs, the creation of a dedicated TU funding stream including in the post-establishment phase and the creation of a borrowing framework for TUs. <\/p><p>The report recognises that relevant priority actions can only be achieved through a structured, system-wide, relevant and dynamic process that will ensure value for money, underpinned by a robust and evidence-based set of monitoring and evaluation arrangements.<\/p><p>The TURN report can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website at: <i><\/i><\/p><p>As announced during Budget 2020 and in response to the TURN report the Government is providing &euro;90 million over the next three years under a new TU Transformation Fund to support consortia such as TUSEI to achieve TU designation and to support the further advancement of established TUs. <\/p><p>The TURN report and the ongoing work of the group, whose remit I am extending, will be of considerable assistance and benefit to consortia such as TUSEI towards achieving TU designation as will access to the new TU Transformation Fund being developed currently in consultation with TURN.<\/p><p>Further TU creation, establishment and progression will be achieved by the relevant stakeholders delivering on the TURN report recommendations and the transformational multi-annual funding underpinning such delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200063#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200063#WRH03200"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[46466\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200063#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the disclosures log made by his Department under freedom of information was last updated; if this is in line with the disclosure policy of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>My Department updates the FOI Disclosure Log at the end of each quarter plus forty working days to allow for extended FOI requests to be decided upon.

This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. <\/p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.  My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer \/ Board of Management.  <\/p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p><p>In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019.

There have been four multi-agency specifically targeted operations within the sea fishing industry between October 2016 and present, and robust engagement will continue.<\/p><p>Where an individual believes themselves to be a victim of human trafficking or where another person believes that this situation applies, they should contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS), or an NGO or State authority (e.g. WRC) who will be able to refer their case to AGS.

My officials and I have ongoing engagement with non-governmental organisations about these cases.\u00a0 I met with the Migrant Rights Council of Ireland in June of this year to discuss the issue of children who have grown up here in such circumstances. The MRCI presented an outline proposal to deal with legacy cases of people who have been undocumented for six years or more for consideration.

Consequently, this office does not measure applications on hand but rather tracks waiting times as the measure for operational effectiveness. <\/p><p>The Courts Service is embarking on an ambitious programme of reform and transformation over the coming years and one of the projects under consideration is an e-probate project. The proposed e-Probate project is at a very early stage of development and its full development is dependent on resources being made available and its relative priority against other significant projects which stem from other legislative and operational commitments. Primary legislation will also need to be passed before an e-probate project can meet its full potential.<\/p><p>All of the findings of the Probate Office review have been implemented to date. In addition there have been significant improvements in the way in which the Principal Probate Office operates. The Revenue Commissioners are currently actively developing an on-line application which will allow users to electronically file their Inland Revenue Affidavit (CA24). Staff from the Principal Probate Office sit on that Project Board and are working with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure the success of that project. This project, once implemented, will make the process of applying for probate significantly easier for citizens, in advance of the roll out of the proposed e-Probate project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200066#WRL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200066#WRL05300"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[46472\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200066#WRL05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the disclosures log made by his Department under freedom of information was last updated; if this is in line with the disclosure policy of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Freedom of Information Act 2014, requires public bodies to routinely publish disclosure logs detailing requests made to the relevant Department under the Act.

Under the terms of the Scheme, the Tribunal is limited to a Chair and six ordinary members who provide services on a part-time basis. It is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation.<\/p>  <p>  Five Departmental staff act as Secretariat to the Tribunal. These staff receive applications and gather the necessary information from applicants and other stakeholders such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to each case. When all required information is available, Tribunal staff send the file to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. Where a decision is appealed, Tribunal staff make arrangements for a Tribunal appeal hearing.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the duration of the process, I should note that it may take several years before an application for compensation is ready for submission to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. For example, final Garda reports on the crime are required, as are the outcomes of any court cases initiated. In addition, in some cases, the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years. It is also the case that the assessment of loss of earnings for consideration by the Tribunal may be complex to determine and may require employer assessment and social welfare reports. These and other factors can have an impact on the duration of any particular application. <\/p>  <p>  An assessment is currently being carried out by officials of my Department in relation to the caseload in the scheme, including the extent and nature of any possible backlog. This assessment is currently being finalised.<\/p>  <p>  Finally the Deputy may be interested to know that in its fifth work programme, published in March 2019, the Law Reform Commission included a review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme as one of 15 planned projects.

Two of these companies are contracted to provide management, catering, housekeeping and general maintenance services in state owned accommodation centres.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Direct Provision system is not just about accommodation.  It is a whole of Government system which delivers a wide range of State services to those seeking international protection in Ireland. These services include health services as provided by the HSE, education services as provided by the State's primary and post-primary schools and, for adult education, the Education and Training Boards across the country.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department's role is to oversee the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to persons seeking international protection.  The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department links vulnerable and at risk persons with the appropriate services. The IPAS acts as a conduit between residents, staff at accommodation centres, state agencies including TUSLA, the HSE and education services. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2018, all contracts for the provision of accommodation services are awarded through an open tendering competition which complies with EU Directive 24\/2014 and are conducted in accordance with the open procedure under the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 (Statutory Instrument 284 of 2016). The tenders submitted are assessed on the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) criteria, which enables the contracting authority to take account of criteria that reflect qualitative aspects of the tender submission as well as price when reaching an award decision. In the procurement competition,  tenderers are required to demonstrate a track record of high quality service delivery and customer care.  Service providers are required, as part of the assessment process, to include in their staffing proposal details of qualifications or experience in social care in order to assess their expertise in dealing with vulnerable and at risk persons. <\/p>  <p>  The specifications for bids to be considered under the tendering process requires successful bidders to deliver independent living (cooking facilities for residents and designated living space for families) and to implement proposals to meet the social care needs of residents. These proposals must outline how the bid will provide social supports to residents and how the recreational, cultural and community needs of residents can be met.<\/p>  <p>   It is the aim of my Department that tendering for such facilities ensures that quality accommodation centres can be procured while ensuring value for money for the Exchequer.  <\/p>  <p>  The standards of service delivered are constantly being improved.  The reforms pursued and implemented by my Department over the past five years have radically overhauled the initial model. The implementation of the McMahon report recommendations, the opting in to the obligations set out in the EU Recast Reception Conditions Directive and the new rolling out of standards designed with NGOs have brought about real and valuable improvements. My officials continue to work with centre operators to provide a high standard of service delivery and care to persons seeking international protection.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of these services is kept under review and the Deputy will be interested to note that a High Level Interdepartmental Group established and chaired by my Department has been tasked with ensuring better coordination of provision of services and meeting needs in the short to medium term.  An Advisory Group has also been established by my Department and it is chaired by the former Secretary General of the European Commission, Dr. Catherine Day.  This Group will advise on the development of a long-term approach to the provision of support including accommodation to persons in the international protection process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200067#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Divorce Process","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200067#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[46648\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200067#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the new reduced waiting time for divorce, which was due to be introduced in June or July 2019, can be applied for.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>The Family Law Act 2019 was signed into law by the President on 25 October 2019 and makes a number of amendments to existing laws in relation to divorce in Ireland.

An SIA is an instrument used by the Commission to support trade negotiations conducted by the EU Trade Commissioner on behalf of the European Union to aid our trade negotiators in conducting sound, evidence-based and transparent trade negotiations with partner countries. Accordingly, SIAs are independent assessments produced by external consultants to provide in-depth analysis of the potential economic, social, human rights, and environmental impacts of trade negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  DG TRADE first conducted a Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment on EU-Mercosur in 2009. However, since that time, several factors led to the Commission revisiting that Assessment, including new and emerging trade flows between the EU and Mercosur region, and updated Commission policy on the inclusion of human rights issues as part of SIA considerations.<\/p>  <p>  DG TRADE commissioned a new EU-Mercosur SIA in March 2017 with the publication of Terms of Reference for an updated SIA. This was followed by an Inception Report in January 2018 published by LSE consulting which provided for an overview of the proposed framework for conducting the sustainability assessment analysis and methodologies to be employed, including the consultations activities for the study.  <\/p>  <p>  On 4th October 2019, the European Commission published the draft interim SIA report for the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.

The Lisbon Treaty extended this competence to cover foreign direct investment, as well as making the European Parliament a co-legislator alongside the Council on trade matters.  Under this architecture the European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries. Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are consulted as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council as has the European Parliament.  In addition, the EU Commission represents Ireland and other EU Member States at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), taking into account the needs of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  <\/p>  <p>  The current international trade environment has seen a rise of protectionism, which is an unwelcome development for Ireland, given our open and globalised economy and has the potential to harm market sentiment and disrupt global supply chains should the situation escalate.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU are strong supporters of multilateral approaches to solving a range of global challenges.  In that context, we see the WTO as the forum by which the international community can successfully promote economic development and free trade in support of good jobs for our people. Importantly, it provides a bulwark against damaging trade disputes and remains as relevant today as it was at its establishment in 1995, albeit reforms to meet the challenges of the 21st Century are required.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly supportive of the EU Commission&rsquo;s ongoing work on WTO reform, including its previous proposals which I believe to be both practical and sensible in their aim to promote engagement by partners, especially the US, to drive the reform process forward.<\/p>  <p>  Another key support for dependable rules-based trade is the EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), which has evolved over time, from the &lsquo;First Generation&rsquo; FTAs dating back to the 1970s which focused on tariffs for goods, to the current &lsquo;New Generation&rsquo; of FTAs which go beyond the reduction or elimination of conventional tariff barriers to include; non-tariff and regulatory barriers, services, investment, recognition of professional qualifications, intellectual property rights, access to public procurement, regulatory cooperation, sustainable development, labour and environment.  These help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish based firms.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most important aspects of the EU's trade policy is that - alongside protecting European businesses and consumers - it is promoting the EU's principles and values.  Furthermore, each Agreement includes arrangements for joint committee oversight which promotes dialogue as a means of settling any potential trade dispute or differences in interpretation, that may arise under the individual Agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits of the establishment of comprehensive EU Free Trade Agreements with third countries must not only be counted in terms of the economic benefits, but also the establishment of strong lines of communication and areas of common interest with other economies.  These ties encourage both the EU and its trade partners to adopt a unified, diplomatic approach to any respective areas of concern that may arise within a mutually respectful environment, as valued, respected and equal trade partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200067#WRM05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200068#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[46017\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200068#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the timeline for the implementation of the recommendations emanating from two reports (details supplied); when the consultative group is due to hold its first meeting; the budget that will be allocated to the group and towards implementation of the report recommendations; the data for Irish SME rates in tabular form; the OECD average for productivity rate, start-up rate, churn rate and percentage of SMEs trading across borders; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am committed to driving the recommendations of the recently launched Report and Strategy Roadmap of the OECD&rsquo;s Review of SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland.

The OECD also stated the vital importance of such a group being Ministerial led thus giving the group the recognition and engagement at political level it so deserves.<\/p><p>The Advisory Group on Small Business (AGSB) has served us well and has carried out a lot of very valuable work since its inception in 2011. However, this recommendation has hit the nail on the head and both I and Minister Breen, group chair, warmly welcomed this recommendation as a positive opportunity to broaden its current remit. <\/p><p>We need to use the policy experts throughout our network to the best advantage of entrepreneurs and SMEs. We need the representative groups and business people themselves to be actively involved. By involving all the different parties that interact with SMEs or are SMEs themselves, we can get the best value and effect out of relevant policies. <\/p><p>The inaugural meeting of the SME and Entrepreneurship Consultation Group took place on Wednesday 27<sup>rd<\/sup>March 2019.

The group will focus on a number of pillars such as R&amp;amp;D, Standards, Skills, Finance and Clustering. As we progress and firm up what the role of the Committee will be, members will be asked to take responsibility for their areas of consideration and provide structured feedback to the Group and its Secretariat who will be expecting concrete feedback and thought out suggestions.<\/p><p>Finally, there is no budget allocated to the running of the Consultation Group as with the previous AGSB. Those willing to participate give of their time and invaluable experience at no additional cost to the exchequer.

We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and my Department and its Agencies have been working hard towards that goal. Significant progress has already been made, with 58% of all IDA client-supported employment, for example, now located outside Dublin. This figure represents the highest such figure in the history of the Agency. Last year the Agency also delivered 113 regional investments. Our aim is to increase these numbers further and create more jobs and economic opportunities across regional Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst site visits are an important tool in helping showcase regional locations to investors, it is important to remember - as I have made clear before - that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant proportion of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country. <\/p>  <p>  For commercial sensitivity reasons, IDA Ireland can only make data available on site visits that have already taken place. Over the first three quarters of this year, Counties Meath and Westmeath have hosted three and 16 site visits respectively.<\/p>  <p>  FDI levels in both Meath and Westmeath are trending in the right direction. Meath experienced a 4.5% increase in IDA supported employment in 2018, with the creation of 67 new jobs.

My Department launched the National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship (NPSE) in October 2014. It was designed to cover the five years up to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  This Policy Statement represents the first time an Irish Government has published a comprehensive national plan for entrepreneurship in Ireland. It set out the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives as a facilitator within the Irish entrepreneurship ecosystem. Its ambition to double the jobs impact of start-ups on the Irish economy over the 5 years by:<\/p>  <p>  -  Increasing the number of start-ups by 25% (3,000 more start-ups per annum)<\/p>  <p>  -  Increasing the survival rate in the first five years by 25% (1,800 more survivors per annum), and <\/p>  <p>  -  Improving the capacity of start-ups to grow to scale by 25%.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office Business Demography report 2016 indicates there were 19,249 new enterprise births in 2016, up from 16,256 in 2015. This is already very close to the target of 3000 for the five-year period. The other measurements will be examined from future Business Demography reports.  <\/p>  <p>  In its inception, the NPSE was seen as a means for facilitating the entrepreneurs of Ireland in creating, surviving and growing their businesses after a period of huge upheaval in terms of the economy and in new technologies and disruptive business models. Irish entrepreneurs, as ever, have shown resilience, innovation and the willingness to take risks which has seen the rapid increase in the number of business births but also a reduction in the rates of business deaths. Marking the half way point of the Statement, 2017 saw the development and organisation of the Mid-term Review. My Department held a number of stakeholder meetings grouped by those involved in education; state bodies and entrepreneurs themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the start-up community were asked to identify those areas which have the potential to impede the growth of their businesses. Entrepreneurs expressed that the ecosystem was of good quality. However, there were concerns that there were numerous supports for start-ups but less and not enough supports once a company grew to the 8-10 employee stage. They felt strongly that there had been progress in increased female participation, but further efforts were needed. The entrepreneurs stated that there is a lack of available skilled labour in the Irish market and the current restrictions and high salary requirements are putting them under enormous pressure. The general access to finance ecosystem in Ireland was seen as under developed with a lack of Venture Capital. The Venture Capital available was perceived to be particularly lopsided in favour of male entrepreneurs. They stated that there needs to be greater diversification in this market. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the feedback from the entrepreneurial stakeholders of the Mid-term Review, I committed to ensuring Ireland has an even more startup friendly environment. I recognised the need to develop a tailored SME and Entrepreneurship Strategy which would ensure Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as being a positive environment to start and grow a business. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2018, my Department engaged the OECD to undertake a Review of SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland to support as I saw to fit the specific needs of Irish enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  It has taken 18 months of intensive largescale engagement across Government, academia, agency, business representation and our small businesses to get to where we now have a SME and Entrepreneurship Policy Roadmap. <\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that the work and engagement over the past five years carried out as a result of the NPSE, provided the impetus and conversation to accelerate the engagement of the OECD. <\/p>  <p>  The final report on the NPSE is currently being compiled by my officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200068#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"InterTradeIreland Data","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200068#WRN03400"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[46392\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200068#WRN03500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the details of the Acumen and Elevate programmes of InterTradeIreland and its funding advisory services; the current and capital budget allocation for the programme in each year over the 2018 to 2020 period in tabular form; the number of participants in each year in the programme; and the maximum funding permitted to a successful applicant.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>InterTradeIreland (ITI), offer a range of supports to help SMEs in Ireland and Northern Ireland explore new cross-border markets, develop new products, processes and services and become investor ready. <\/p><p>Acumen is ITI&rsquo;s flagship trade programme which supports SMEs to develop cross-border business.

Significant progress is being made, with 58% of all IDA-supported employment now outside of Dublin.  2018 also saw more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years.  <\/p><p>When it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), site visits do represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas.

As regards Waterford as a whole, the County hosted 16 site visits over the first three quarters of this year.<\/p><p>The IDA continues to actively market locations in Waterford to potential investors. Under its Regional Property Programme (RPP), the Agency has constructed two Advanced Technology Buildings (ATBs) in the County. The first ATB was completed in 2015 and is currently occupied by EirGen Pharma. The second ATB was completed earlier this year and the IDA is currently seeking, through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas, an investor for it. <\/p><p>More generally, Waterford continues to be a strong performer in attracting FDI. There are 38 IDA client companies in the County employing approximately 7,100 people. In terms of recent investments, Emerald Contact Centre announced in September that they will create 200 new jobs over the next three years. In July, Agora Companies announced 135 additional jobs at their Waterford offices. Last May, Allstate Sales Group announced that it will establish software development and support centres in Sligo and Waterford, creating 100 new jobs in each location. <\/p><p>While progress has been made in helping to generating new investment in Waterford, the Government remains determined to attract more FDI to the County.

However, it must be appreciated that where a person is retired they cannot have a dispute concerning their employment or non-employment.

Under the Regulations health warnings which advise consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance are mandatory. The Regulations also provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. The Regulations require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products that they place on the market and, if a manufacturer, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the Health Service Executive and to explain what corrective action has been taken.

The evidence review is expected to be completed in March 2020 and it will contribute to informing any future regulation in this area.

The proposals are detailed and require careful consideration.

The ceilings are an indicative amount for each year.  The drawdown may be more or less in any given year as it is dependent on the progress of the  Rural Development Programme, but the overall ceiling for the programming period 2014-2020 cannot be exceeded. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Direct Payments Regulation (EU) No 1307\/2013, the National Ceiling for Ireland is set out in Annex 2 and provides for &euro;1,211,066,000 (&euro;1.21bn) for the year 2020.<\/p>  <p>  My key focus is to work together with my European colleagues to achieve agreement on the CAP reform proposals and the maintenance of the CAP budget.

The report noted that there are established statutory annual reporting arrangements to the European Union in respect of these targets. In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland also reports annually to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in line with our obligations as a Party to that Convention.

Specific schemes included under TEC are as follows:- <\/p><p><b>- After-School Child Care Scheme<\/b><b>(ASCC)<\/b>- provides subsidies towards afterschool care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents and parents on Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection employment programmes (not including Community Employment).<\/p><p><b>- Childcare Education and Training Support  (CETS) <\/b>- provides subsidies to certain training course participants on courses provided by the Education and Training Boards (ETB, formerly FAS and VEC) and Secondary Schools.<\/p><p><b>- Community Employment Childcare (CEC) <\/b>- provides subsidies for early learning and care and school age childcare for children of parents who are participating  on Community Employment schemes.<\/p><p><b>Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (CCSR): <\/b><\/p><p>This programme provides up to 60 weeks of early learning and care and school age childcare support on a part-time basis to Programme Refugees to support their resettlement and integration into Irish society, up to 5 days per week for children aged 0 &ndash; 5 years and for primary school going children during the school holidays. The parents are not charged a fee.<\/p><p><b><\/b><\/p><p><b>Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (Transitional) (CCSR(T)): <\/b><\/p><p>As part of the &ldquo;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rdquo; the DCYA provides access to free early learning and care and school age childcare on a part-time and sessional basis for pre-school children (ages 0 &ndash; 5) and primary school-going children during the school holidays for families experiencing homelessness. In addition, a daily meal is provided for each child.  The parents are not charged a fee.<\/p><p><b>National Childcare Scheme (NCS):<\/b><\/p><p>With the exception of the TEC schemes, no new registrations can be made on these programmes after November 15 as they will  be replaced by the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) which is due to open for online applications on 20 November, with subsidies flowing from 25 November.  There will be two kinds of subsidy available under the NCS: <\/p><p>A universal subsidy is payable for children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme if later) who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider or childminder.  The universal subsidy is not means-tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week (maximum &euro;20 per week per child, or &euro;1040 per annum).<\/p><p>An income-related subsidy is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider or childminder.  The level of subsidy payable is determined by the family&rsquo;s reckonable income (i.e. gross income minus tax, PRSI and other deductibles and minus any applicable multiple child discount).<\/p><p>Many parents availing of current targeted early learning and care and school age childcare schemes will be better off under the new NCS and able to access higher levels of subsidisation.  Many others will qualify for financial support for the first time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200079#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200079#WRY01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[46369\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200079#WRY02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the work her Department is undertaking with the Department of Justice and Equality on pathways to residency for undocumented children; the supports in place for undocumented children in care and aftercare; the number in the care of Tusla by county; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1324,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has for a number of years had a dedicated service for separated children seeking asylum, who may or may not be undocumented.

Bids were sought from local authorities around the country for funding under the Programme. The  development of such a multi-annual funding programme was a key recommendation of the report on the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The programme will enable the progressive resolution, on a priority basis, of substandard Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure  - commonly called DPI  much of which was installed in housing estates during the building boom of the late 1990's and early 2000's. These privately owned and temporary facilities provide mostly wastewater treatment with a small number providing drinking water.<\/p>  <p>  In a survey conducted by my Department in late 2015, it was estimated that just over 900 housing estates around the country depended on Developer Provided Infrastructure for their water services. However, in a workshop recently organised by my Department to inform local authorities of the new Resolution Programme it is now estimated that around 513 housing estates depend on such infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2016, my Department launched the National Taking in Charge Initiative. This was in recognition of the financial commitment that residents made in buying their homes, and the importance of ensuring that roads, open spaces, car parks, and service connections are completed and maintained to a satisfactory standard.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Initiative was to trial or demonstrate new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the process for taking-in-charge of housing estates - including those with Developer Provided Infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  The collaborative experience gained by the key stakeholders in implementing the Taking-in-Charge Initiative has now informed the new Resolution Programme. The objective of the Programme is to resolve this sub-standard component of our water services infrastructure in a sustainable manner, and ultimately to support residential estates being taking in charge. The National Development Plan published in February 2018, includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 to support the Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The closing date for bids under the programme was 18 September 2019. A total number of 19 local authorities with Developer Provided Infrastructure in estates in their areas made applications under the programme for support. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently completing a preliminary evaluation and clarification process on the bids received with the local authorities. The intention is to shortly set up an Expert Panel to  independently evaluate the bids and recommend suitable projects for funding. This evaluation will take place over the coming months. Membership of the Panel will include Departmental, stakeholder and independent representation in the Chair.<\/p>  <p>  The Expert Panel will make recommendations to me on the suitability of projects for funding under the programme based on the criteria set out in the Framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals. <\/p>  <p>  The Panel will report to my Department when their examination of the bids is concluded. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in early 2020 on approvals and allocations once that process is concluded and has been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200082#WRBB05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Rents","counter":1530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200082#WRBB05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1531,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[46362\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200082#WRBB05600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if social welfare payments received by a tenant, such as carer&rsquo;s allowance, can be assessed as income for differential rents by a local authority (details supplied); if a national framework exists that governs local authorities to ensure consistency in this respect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1532,"content":"<p>The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is laid down in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966.

As rent is calculated using each local authority&rsquo;s own formula, the schemes do vary in a number of ways from each other.

Each local authority lists sources of income which they consider assessable for rent purposes and these can and do differ across the country at present.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, provides for the introduction of a national rents framework for social housing tenants.

This has included the establishment of the Peatlands Council, intensive and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters. The aim is to address the needs of turf cutters as part of an overall raised bog designated sites network solution, as set out in the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022. This involves a balance of protecting traditional rights, providing compensation where these rights are curtailed and seeking to facilitate feasible alternatives, where possible, while working to ensure that Ireland meets its legal obligations. <\/p>  <p>  In the region of 2,000 applicants have qualified under the\u00a0cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme\u00a0from 48 of the 53 raised bog special area of conservation sites. There are particular reasons as to there being no qualifying applicants under the scheme for the remaining 5 sites, for example, the lack of turf cutting on these sites during the qualifying period. <\/p>  <p>  For 11 raised bog special areas of conservation, relocation sites have been identified and developed. Some of these relocation sites have been operational since 2013\/14 with the most recently developed relocation sites ready for turf cutting to begin in the 2020 season. Relocation sites for a further 6 special area of conservation bogs have been identified by the Department and are at various stages of development. The Department is still investigating suitable relocation sites for 7 raised bog special areas of conservation.<\/p>  <p>  For a number of the special area of conservation sites, the non-designated site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases and within the framework of the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, the Department, in consultation with turf cutter representatives, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the Habitats Directive to provide for turf cutting with certain areas of raised bog special areas of conservation. 14 sites are under consideration for the possible application of article 6 of the Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200083#WRCC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1592,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200083#WRCC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1593,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[46701\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200083#WRCC05400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of additional staff appointed in her Department and agencies under her remit in 2019; the estimated cost of hiring the additional staff, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1594,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is detailed in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Organisation<\/th>       <th>Number of additional\u00a0staff appointed in 2019<\/th>       <th>Estimated annualised\u00a0payroll cost of additional staff appointed in 2019 <br \/><br \/>&euro;million<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht<\/td>       <td>33<\/td>       <td>1.22<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Arts Council<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>0.244<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Crawford Art Gallery<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>0.048<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Concert Hall<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>0.116<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Gallery of Ireland<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>       <td>0.435<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Library of Ireland<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>0.060<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Museum of Ireland<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>0.240<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Screen Ireland<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>0.060<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterways Ireland<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>0.402<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>79<\/td>       <td>2.825<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>I am informed that my Department,\u00a0Waterways Ireland,\u00a0the National Museum of Ireland and the National Gallery of Ireland all recruited a number of seasonal staff in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0As this is an annual occurrence to give additional cover for busy periods in public-facing sections such as the National Parks\u00a0in my Department and does not give rise to a year-on-year increase in payroll, seasonal staff are not accounted for in the above figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200083#WRCC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
