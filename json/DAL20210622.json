Media reports quoted a series of housing experts predicting continued housing price hikes.  This echoes similar commentary from the Governor of the Central Bank last week.  One economist said of our housing market that it is on fire.  Another warned that house prices could reach Celtic tiger levels.  A third expressed the concern that house prices could continue to rise for the next four years.  All of this is, of course, an indictment of the Taoiseach and Government&rsquo;s failed policies.<\/p>  <p>  Last Thursday during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, raised with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, the issue of rising house prices.  By way of response the T&aacute;naiste said that house prices are cheaper than they were 14 years ago and that, in any event, people were in a position to borrow more, in other words, to amass more debt.<\/p>  <p>  This approach will only increase house prices further.  One has to ask has the T&aacute;naiste learned nothing from the past ten years?  Does he not understand that more credit will mean more house price inflation, more debt for workers and families and more expensive housing?  Does he not understand that increased debt means greater risk of mortgage default, repossession and, in worst case circumstances, perhaps homelessness?  <\/p>  <p>  I spoke yesterday to a family in Ringsend.  There were three generations living in one home.  They are by no means unique but I will talk about this family.  One of the family members, a young woman aged 35 with a good job, had just moved back into her mother&rsquo;s home for the fifth time.  Because of the Government's failed policies, this woman and countless thousands like her feel that their lives are on hold.  A whole generation has been left in the same situation.  This woman and people like her do not need unsustainable levels of debt forced upon them; they simply need to put a roof over their heads.  She needs a genuinely affordable home for her and her family.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree with the T&aacute;naiste that house prices should increase further and that workers and families should go further into debt?  Does he think that is acceptable or does he accept that house prices are too high?  Does he also accept that heaping even greater debt on workers and families will force prices up and will not bring them down?  All of this scenario, as it unfolds again in a housing crisis, smacks very strongly of the bad old days of Fianna F&aacute;il in power.<\/p> <p>The housing system is designed and delivered not for ordinary people, families or workers but by and for developers, and the banks too, of course, get their pound of flesh and line their pockets.<br\/><br\/>Will the Taoiseach clarify where he stands?  Does he stand with his T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, who takes the <i>laissez-faire <\/i>approach whereby people should simply borrow more and buy more expensive housing, or does he accept that we have a crisis and need to deliver affordable housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624367100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy where she stands.  I listened to her soundbite after soundbite, slogan after slogan, which is really all about electioneering, is it not?  The reference to Ringsend is no accident, obviously.  We have all been out and about.  I am very conscious of the significant issue that housing is.  I have said repeatedly in the House that housing is a crisis.  The Government is just about 12 months in office, dealing with a global pandemic that, unfortunately, impacted on house-building in 2020 by about 5,000 houses that we could have got built if there had not been a lockdown, and the lockdown of 2021 has impacted on us as well.  That said, the Government has been very focused on building more houses, getting more supply into the market, which is the key issue, and doing it in such a way that we can make it affordable for people.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy knows the figures.  About &euro;3.3 billion has been allocated for housing alone in 2021.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is introducing a shared equity scheme, which will help people in terms of affordability, and the Government enhanced the help-to-buy scheme last year.  That has helped about 22,000 buyers get on the property ladder.  That is 22,000 people who have benefited from that scheme, yet the Deputy opposed that scheme and then comes to the House and lectures everybody else about affordability and trying to make housing affordable.  She cannot have it both ways in respect of her stance on housing.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy seems to want to exploit it to win votes but comes up with very few solutions to it.  She opposes every measure the Government introduces to try to make housing affordable.  She is opposing the Affordable Housing Bill and the measures the Minister is introducing, in regard not just to shared equity but also to the enhancement of the serviced sites fund, which will involve the State providing thousands of affordable new homes over the next year or two.  She opposes an extension and expansion of Part V of the Planning and Development Act to designate a range of homes for first-time buyers.<\/p>  <p>  The first ever cost-rental scheme, being introduced by the Minister and providing up to 400 units, will be expanded significantly in 2022 and beyond.  We have brought about 2,500 voids back into use very quickly through the July stimulus funding of last year.  The Land Development Agency Bill is going through the Oireachtas and will provide additional capacity, through the agency, to get more houses built - both affordable and social.  The initial portfolio for the Land Development Agency can potentially provide up to 4,000 homes to 2025, yet the Deputy opposes that also.<\/p>  <p>  Family homelessness, in the past 12 months, has decreased by 39% on the total recorded in March 2020.  It is the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since February 2016.  In a short space of time, that represents very significant progress by the Minister on this issue.  He is using every possible opportunity, including a suite of affordable measures and a strong social housing programme, to try to get additional supply into the market.<\/p>  <p>  In sharp contrast to that, the Deputy opposes all the affordability measures that have been introduced to date and that will be introduced in the coming while, and on the ground her party has been opposing many housing projects that are shovel ready.  Thousands of houses have been rejected and opposed by her party, which is completely inconsistent with the stance she takes in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1624367400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Attacking Sinn F&eacute;in for a housing crisis Fianna F&aacute;il created demonstrates just how threadbare the Taoiseach's approach is.

There is no doubt we witnessed a political transformation, unlike almost anything we have seen for the past 20 years.  Having been an enthusiastic Tory fiscal conservative for his entire life, the T&aacute;naiste has seen the light.  There were so many spending commitments announced on Saturday that Fine Gael delegates must have been checking to make sure they were at the right event.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to list some of the promises, but there were so many I may inadvertently leave some out.  They included a commitment to build 40,000 houses per year, an extra &euro;4 billion per year for the health service, expanded medical card eligibility, occupational pensions, a living wage and more money for welfare payments, all paid for not with tax increases but some vague sounding growth at a time the economy recovers from the pandemic, we are coping from Brexit and our corporate taxes are set to reduce.<\/p>  <p>  I wonder if the Taoiseach is fearful that the next time he is down in Dublin Bay South, he will come across a Fine Gael bus with a big sign on the side of it stating there is &euro;4 billion extra per year for the HSE emblazoned on the side of it.  The T&aacute;naiste's other political inspiration, Boris Johnson, found that kind of stunt useful.  Given imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I am gratified the T&aacute;naiste has taken on some of the Social Democrats' policies, including improved public services, better pay and conditions for workers, a social welfare safety net in order that people to live in dignity and much increased State investment in housing.  However, I am not sure he is a credible person to deliver on this given Fine Gael, after ten years in office, has not managed to reach the Rebuilding Ireland target of 25,000 houses annually, never mind 40,000 houses.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, 1 million people are currently on hospital waiting lists and it has taken Fine Gael ten years to realise the problems with gifting a new &euro;800 million maternity hospital to a private company with a religious ethos.<\/p> <p> Was the Taoiseach warned or even consulted in advance of these announcements?  Are we to understand that the health budget will increase by &euro;4 billion every year from now on?  Will that come as a surprise to the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly?  Is the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, down in the Custom House planning the delivery of 40,000 houses?  I hope so.  Who in Government is deciding fiscal policy?  Is it solely a Fine Gael remit?

I can report that the Minister for Health is in good form over the last 48 hours in terms of the underpinning of the substantial health budget which will be required.  He might optimistically think that his bilaterals with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, may not be as difficult or challenging as health Ministers generally have them with Ministers of public expenditure.  That remains to be seen.<\/p>  <p>  In a more serious vein, the programme for Government aims essentially to take this country through the pandemic as safely as possible, to facilitate the emergence of a strong economy and society and to learn the lessons of the pandemic in terms of a stronger state in health with reforms and funding.  It is not just about funding, but the reforms that go along with it.<\/p>  <p>  We have learned a lot during the pandemic.  I was keen in late summer when working with the Minister for Health to ensure the winter initiative was introduced with &euro;600 million, an unprecedented level of funding for a winter initiative, and to give full-year funding to that.  That has made a significant difference to the capacity of the health service to withstand normal winter pressures, never mind the third wave.  If it had not been for that level of investment in home care packages, community diagnostics and acute capacity, we would have been in far greater difficulty during the winter.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding information technology, the digital transformation that occurred in certain aspects of health is something else we have to build on as we emerge from the pandemic.  There will, without question, be a stronger health budget in the next year or two to make sure we embed the reforms that have been made and to underpin the level of services required.  We are living longer generally and that will create its own additional cost.<\/p>  <p>  On housing, we are very clear the single biggest issue of our time is to make sure the current generation, particularly but not just young people, are in a position to get into the housing market and buy houses that they can afford and that we can provide more social housing.  With the Housing for All strategy, we are focusing on a significant social housing programme for the next five years.<\/p>  <p>  Another key plank is climate change.

It may be characterised as a more sober assessment of the situation over the next five years, generally speaking, in terms of the framework.  We knew that, for these two years, exceptional spending would be required in terms of the pandemic, and an exceptional deficit.  Over the lifetime of the Government, as part of the programme for Government, we have said we will ease our way through to a balanced fiscal position over the next five years.

Denmark and Finland had roughly the same level of mortality as this State and has had roughly the same level of vaccinations.  They managed to open their indoor dining facilities in April and May.  Here in Ireland, hotels have been allowed to open up indoor dining since the start of June and the T&aacute;naiste says there is no science behind the decision to discriminate between hotels, restaurants and pubs.<\/p>  <p>  There has been incredible confusion on our streets over the past while.

This will be the second of many protests since fishermen have had enough of inaction, spin and lies.  They will take the Taoiseach and the Government's leadership to task for huge inaction which will see every fisherman lose anything between &euro;5,000 and &euro;20,000, with significant job losses in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I was told that the Taoiseach was in west Cork last Saturday, in Union Hall and Castletownbere.  It is always important for a Head of State to visit west Cork.  Those who told me on Friday and Saturday that the Taoiseach was coming felt that it was way too late, other than to hear about the nightmare crisis that these fishermen face after calamitous errors by this Government.  When in west Cork last Saturday, did the Taoiseach apologise for his continued refusal to appoint a senior Minister for the marine, which was a red line for me in negotiations for the formation of a Government?  No matter how I explained the imminent crisis of Brexit and other major issues related to fishing, the Taoiseach refused to understand the importance of appointing a Minister to protect Irish waters, fishermen and our richest resource.  Did the Taoiseach take the opportunity to apologise for signing into law the unjust and shockingly unfair penalty points while in his short term as Minister for Agriculture and the Marine in 2020?<\/p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach apologise for the shocking handling of Brexit negotiations in late 2020, where clear evidence shows that the Government's eye was off the ball despite me pleading for the Taoiseach to be involved?  While the Government failed, France and other European countries had their terms and conditions fully met by negotiator Michel Barnier before they would agree to anything.  Did the Taoiseach apologise to the fishermen for the cock-up with the weighing crisis hoisted upon our fishermen, with the weighing of fish on our piers for inshore and pelagic fishermen?  We have since found out that the Minister and Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, knew in December 2020 but failed to consult with the industry until 5 p.m. on Friday, 16 April, about what the industry would call a crisis beyond belief.  If the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and SFPA could add more insult to injury to the Irish fishing fleet, we now have an agreement to allow French and Belgian trawlers to park at Irish piers and to unload straight onto lorries without weighing or any checks of any sort.  This is a hard pill for honest Irish fishermen who park beside them and have been afflicted by every Irish rule and regulation inflicted on them by the State.<\/p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach apologise to the fishermen after the attempted ramming of a Castletownbere vessel off the Castletownbere coast by a Spanish trawler which was illegally fishing in Irish waters?  It was three times the size of the Castletownbere trawler.  Irish fishermen have no protection in their own waters since no one could come to their aid to immediately arrest the Spanish trawler which was carrying out an act of piracy.  The only explanation that the Taoiseach gave last Saturday, which has left many exasperated, is that there is an uneven and unfair burden on Irish fishermen and he has made it clear to the Commission.  Is the best the Taoiseach has to offer?  Everyone knew this already.  Will the Taoiseach reveal today how these fishermen's incomes and livelihoods, which the Government is helping to destroy, can be saved without the word \"decommission\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200009#G00100","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1624368900,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I had good and constructive engagement with the fishers in west Cork over the weekend.  I visited Castletownbere and Union Hall.  We had a matter of fact meeting to go through the issues in a sensible way, listening to what the fishers had to say and identifying the issues.  The country was faced with a no-deal Brexit or a trade and co-operation agreement.  A no-deal Brexit would have been catastrophic for the Irish fishing industry, given how dependent our pelagic fleet is on fish in British waters and always was.  It was always a problem even prior to Brexit and   once Brexit was contemplated at all.  That said, there was, in our view, an unfair burden on Ireland arising out of that agreement, which we are pursuing with the Commission.  That leads to the key item at the meeting.  At the meeting I had yesterday, I initiated a social dialogue forum with the fishing industry and I met with the producer organisations and fishing representatives from the different categories and sectors for more than two hours to go through these issues.  One is the Common Fisheries Policy review next year, which will give us an opportunity to see if we can claw back some of the quota and share that we lost as a result of Brexit.  Another issue is the control plan.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Collins is being somewhat disingenuous.<\/p> <p>The Department did not remove the derogation in respect of the weighing of fish in our factories.  As he knows, the Commission initiated proceedings and an investigation into the plan.  Its implementing decision revoked the approval of the Irish control plan for the weighing of fishery products which had been submitted.  We received that Commission implementing decision revoking the approval of the Irish control plan submitted for the weighing of fishery products.  The SFPA must now respond to that.  This is a very serious issue for all the fishers.  One of the reasons I was in Union Hall and Castletownbere was to witness at first hand the impact of this decision.<\/p> <p> We also need to engage with the Commission on that.  Rightly or wrongly, the Commission's assertion is that there was overfishing of our quota and it wants to claw some of that back.  We are resisting that.  We will need to deploy all legal tools at our disposal to resist it.  That brings me back to a point I made to all the groups yesterday.  We need to reset our relationship with Europe regarding fishing.  The Commission's perception of how we are enforcing the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland and our perception of that are miles apart.  Standing up and attacking the Government on these issues is missing the point.  We need to engage with the European Commission on these issues.  I intend to engage with it.  I intend to work closely with the fishing industry to go through the items I have just referenced and other items that were also raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200009#G00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624369500,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach mentioned the weighing issue and suggested it is the business of the SFPA.  The bottom line is that the SFPA and the Minister knew in December that there was a crisis.  They did not consult with the industry and they are only doing so now when it is too late.  Listening to the Taoiseach today convinces me that the Government does not have a plan for fishing other than to kick the can down the road until next year.  All the fishermen are being fed is spin and more spin, going around in circles and leading them to a crisis protest tomorrow.<\/p>  <p>  Only last week the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, stated incorrectly to the D&aacute;il that the control plan is at public consultation.  This is incorrect as only white fish and shellfish plans are at public consultation.  Pelagic fishing is excluded from the consultation and is not part of any proposals.  He also stated that the SFPA would submit the control plan to the European Commission.  This is incorrect and misleading as section 43 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 states it is the function of the Minister to submit the control plan to the European Commission following a Cabinet decision on that plan.  No control plan can be submitted to the European Commission by the SFPA.  This kind of spin to our fishermen is why we are in the mess we are in today.<\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Taoiseach to give us an honest answer.  How does the Government propose to immediately address the incomes and the livelihoods of thousands of Irish fishermen who will face an enormous drop in income or face losing their jobs?

None of this should be new to people.  References were made to leasing and so on, as was well known at the time.  When the State is investing in and building a hospital, it should ideally own it.  The State will own the hospital but there is an issue with regard to the freehold of the site.  The Minister for Health will be engaging with stakeholders in that respect.  Planning permission for the hospital was secured in 2017.  Enabling works were carried out with regard to the car park and pharmacy.  This is all public knowledge.

As far as I am concerned, there is one very significant issue here, which is the safety of women in particular in terms of building a modern maternity hospital.  I have often been struck by the fact that we have only managed this in one location, which is in Cork, where we have a modern maternity hospital with a neonatal facility.  Everyone agreed way back that we should have co-location in terms of optimal best outcomes for women in particular and that is why the original idea of the national maternity hospital co-locating with St. Vincent's Hospital arose.  I do not think people want to unwind that idea of co-location and that creates its own context for this.

In the first 18 months, only 4,378 homes and businesses have been reached out of a target of 115,000 and only 632 of these have actually been connected.  Given that contractors were allowed to continue working on the roll-out over the past year, it is necessary for the Taoiseach to explain what has happened and why so little progress has been made.  People in my constituency of Mayo want to know what is going on.  For them to see such a shocking low number of connections is completely discouraging.  There has not been an adequate explanation of the situation.  What is the new agreed downgraded target for the connections this year?

It goes nowhere near meeting the demands they made.  They met with the Taoiseach and have written to him subsequently, but have received no direct response from him.  They want to know whether that is the end of it now.  Is that all they are getting?  In particular, they are pleading around the issue of the extension of the ten-year rule to something like 15 years.  Otherwise, many of these drivers who have lost a year's income and are carrying debts will have to replace their vehicles at the end of this year.  They simply will not have the money to do so.  Given that billions of euro have rightly been given to other industries, will the Taoiseach tell the taxi drivers that a measure that would actually cost nothing will be agreed?

It will create employment overall in the region, which will be of great significance for the infrastructural works that will facilitate both residential and commercial developments in the Cork docklands of benefit to many people living in the northside of Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Rail investment of &euro;185 million in commuter rail, particularly in regard to the revamp of Kent Station and the Cobh line, from Glounthaune to Monard, will have significant impacts throughout the northside of Cork and the hinterland around the northside of Cork city and county.  It will be a significant investment because it will leverage and incentivise further urban development along the rail track.  The idea is that in order to get sustainable communities, there needs to be investment in a combination of public transport and housing.  It will be very interesting to see how the development pans out.  We are very keen that it will lead to significant economic development on the northside of Cork, and I believe this rail investment will in time come to be seen as very important.<\/p>  <p>  On the new elective hospital, the HSE has made submissions in that regard and land on the northside of Cork has been identified as one potential location.  It is important that we modernise healthcare facilities throughout the country, and a number of elective hospitals have been identified.  Some work, negotiations and considerations are still under way with the HSE in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare, whose framework covers this, and the Government will eventually be involved in the decision-making.  The hospital will make for a very significant development in modernising our healthcare system and will make it more efficient in terms of elective care.  It will take pressure off the trauma centres and the centres for excellence and ensure we can get through our waiting lists much more quickly than is currently the case at the major trauma centres.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Kelly, there are various broader metrics and standards.  We are developing a well-being framework under the aegis of my Department to identify the characteristics and that will more broadly measure not just the economic metrics but also the broader quality of life in Ireland.  This will be within an OECD framework.  A similar model has been developed in New Zealand and elsewhere, and we are keen to adapt such a framework to Ireland.  Of course, there has always been the issue between GDP and GNI in Ireland.  Equally, however, the impact of foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland, when it is stripped out, is not accurately assessed either.  It too can be understated, in regard to the quality of work and so on being provided and the historic added value of human capital, experience and expertise that have been garnered over the years, which have a consequential impact on indigenous industry, enterprise and research.  <\/p>  <p>  We still have much to do.  As for housing, I think it is about capacity and delivery.  We built about 20,000 houses last year and lost about 5,000 because of Covid.  This year, it is estimated that the figure we build could be between 18,000 and 20,000, losing a further 5,000 or 6,000 because of Covid and the lockdown-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200018#Q00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1624374000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Thank you, Taoiseach.

The comments on students were not fair.  The Government has been supportive of students in the context of the application of the pandemic unemployment payment in an unprecedented way.  Ordinarily, students have never availed of social welfare payments while studying full time at college, yet the Government, in the context of the pandemic, supported students through the pandemic unemployment payment.  It was unprecedented.  It has been very helpful and supportive to students and their families and it is not fair to try to characterise it as anything but that.  It is certainly not minimalist, as Deputy McDonald tried to suggest.<\/p>  <p>  A great deal of populism is going on at the moment.  Everybody wants to appeal to everybody and a by-election campaign is taking place, but there needs to be balance and perspective in regard to how we emerge from the pandemic and invest in new sectors.  The most important thing we can do for young people is to invest in education, research and skills and reskilling, and to provide more places in further education, apprenticeships and third level.<\/p> <p>We will do that.  We did it last year and the economic recovery plan provides substantial investment for thousands of additional places, through SOLAS, the further education sector, third level and fourth level in terms of research.  That is what we have to do as a country in terms of making sure we are competitive into the future as an economy.  We have to invest in human capital and young people and give them the opportunity to gain additional qualifications to reskill, in terms of the retrofit programme, for example.<\/p> <p> We need more apprenticeships in construction.  Everyone talks about housing.  We need more people who are skilled to build houses into the future.

It sets out to develop our capacity and protect the State.  In the last budget, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, tripled the budget for the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  It manages the State's incident response process to cyberattacks and is responsible for a series of initiatives to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure and public sector ICT.  It works closely with the Garda and the Defence Forces.  It is currently engaged in a detailed risk assessment of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities in the State.  It also provides public information on cybersecurity risks and best practice.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the recent cyberattack on the HSE, our overarching priority was to restore all medical services.  It was extremely difficult on font-line workers.  I pay the warmest of tributes to all staff in the HSE, including those in the war room who had to deal with the cyberattack and worked night and day, at great cost to themselves, to restore services.  It had a significantly negative impact on services.  Front-line staff on the hospital floor had to deal with the absence of scanning, patient records and so on.  It was extremely difficult for all concerned and I thank them for their enormous efforts in maintaining treatments for patients.<\/p>  <p>  A group comprising the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan; the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly; the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys; the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman; and the Minister of State with responsibility for communications and e-government, Deputy Ossian Smyth, was established to monitor and steer the cross-Government response to the cyberattack.  It was supported in this by the National Security Analysis Centre, based in my Department.  That is in keeping with the arrangements in the National Cyber Security Centre&rsquo;s, NCSC, critical national incident response plan for managing incidents such as these.  The technical response to the attack involved a strongly co-ordinated effort across Government working in co-operation with specialist private sector contractors.  That dedicated work is ongoing and will continue until the systems are restored and functioning again.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda national cybercrime bureau leads on the criminal investigation and will continue to work closely with the NCSC and the HSE on this.  It is also working with international partners, given the nature of the crime involved.  It is clear in the context of cyberattacks that one has to have a team-based response, both within the country across Departments and also across Europe.  It is a collective effort.  The UK was particularly helpful in providing cybersecurity expertise.  People rallied to the call to help us.  The Polish Government gave its experience because it had been the victim of a recent attack.  This needs to be acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  On the national security committee and the analysis I have received, there are a number of high-level threats or potential threats to the State that we have to keep an eye on and that some Deputies have referenced, relating to international geopolitics and to right-ring extremists and extremists of one kind or another.  Our security apparatus, our Defence Forces and our garda&iacute; keep a vigilant eye on all of that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly asked about the status of the commission on the Defence Forces.  That independent commission has been established and has a mandate to report within 12 months.  I think Deputies are familiar with the terms of reference, which relate to the structure and size of the Defence Forces, encompassing capability structures and staffing, appropriate governance, high-level command and control, pay and allowance structures, recruitment, retention, career progression, leveraging the capabilities of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, and its support to the permanent Defence Forces, making service in the RDF more attractive and, of course, arrangements for the effective defence of the country by land, air and sea.<\/p>  <p>  The commission has invited submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relevant to its terms of reference.  It received over 500 submissions, which it is analysing.

Since it was first published in 2014, the national risk assessment has provided an overview of strategic risks and has drawn attention, at an early stage, to the importance of phenomena such as Brexit, housing shortages and pandemics.  The process of preparing the assessment has been designed to ensure wide consultation across the full range of stakeholders.  This involves the dissemination of a draft for public consultation and opportunities for stakeholders and Oireachtas Members to contribute to the development of the final version.<\/p>  <p>  The national risk assessment is not intended to replace the detailed risk management and preparedness carried out by Departments and agencies, including by the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre.  Rather, it is part of the overall risk management framework and is a tool to assist Departments and agencies to update existing or develop new mitigation plans.<\/p>  <p>  The two years since the NRA was last published in 2019 have been particularly turbulent as a number of major risks have materialised.  The Covid-19 pandemic has been the most significant of these, not least in the cost to health and life.  Given the impact on resources of the pandemic crisis in 2020, the Department was not in a position to prepare an updated national risk assessment last year.

Will the Taoiseach please outline to us whether he believes there will be a need for a booster at the end of this year, starting with the elderly and working all the way through the various vulnerable groups and age cohorts?  Have we purchased the vaccines?  I know about Pfizer.  I heard stories today about Janssen and Moderna.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach outlined his thoughts on a booster campaign and what vaccines have been purchased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200020#S00900","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624375800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>On behalf of Deputy Lawless, I thank the Taoiseach for his response regarding the national risk assessment.

By my calculations, that is far too low, even by the standards of any comparable neutral country.  In a recent budget there was a bigger annual increase for the military pensions than there was for day-to-day defence expenditure.  Could the Taoiseach have this examined, perhaps by reference to other similar neutral countries for instance, Finland, Sweden and Austria?  It is an important issue and we need to take account of it.

The Taoiseach has spoken a lot about higher education, placements and people getting qualifications.  I repeatedly put to him a number of examples of where we are not doing what he is saying we are going to do.  One thing the pandemic has done is created something of a mental health crisis for particular cohorts in society, yet we are chronically under capacity in terms of the supply of psychologists.  We have 400 fewer psychologists than were identified as being required under A Vision for Change.  Interestingly, in Sharing the Vision, the reference to psychologists has disappeared altogether because we have not been able to build the capacity.  I pointed out to the Taoiseach that the difficulties are immense, in particular for working class people or people on low incomes in getting doctorates in psychology.  There is a chronic lack of places for all types of psychology doctorates.  The level of fees for doctorates is &euro;15,000 a year, and in the case of educational and counselling psychology no funding at all is available.  People are expected to do 30 months over three years of work and get no funding.  People are working unpaid on placement and paying perhaps &euro;50,000 over three years in fees.  They are in dire straits.  How exactly is that helping remove obstacles to higher education in a key area like mental health when we have 10,000 children, adolescents and adults waiting for psychological services?<\/p>  <p>  I could make the same point about doctors and the obstacles being put in the way of graduate entry courses for doctors in terms of fees and the cost of concluding their doctorates, or student nurses who still face significant fees, which they should not have to pay when we need more nurses and who are being made to work unpaid on placements throughout their nurse training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200021#T00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1624375800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>A month ago I raised in the D&aacute;il the need for us to take action to slow down the spread of the Delta variant in Ireland, including mandatory hotel quarantine for travellers from Britain.

When I first raised it, we had a small number of cases of the Delta variant in Ireland but now one in five cases is the Delta variant.  In Britain, they have slowed down and delayed the reopening.  Belgium has now closed its borders to travellers from Britain in order to stop the spread of the Delta variant.  We know that it is more transmissible, and that one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca is not very effective against it.  We know that young people, who make up a majority of the staff in the hospitality sector, have overwhelmingly not been vaccinated.  Does the Government still think that it is not taking any risks?  Is it still planning to go ahead with the reopening of indoor hospitality on 5 July?

I can get the specific volumes for the Deputy.  That is in addition to what we have already agreed in respect of Pfizer.  This is all part of the European Union pre-purchase agreement framework for 2022 and 2023.  The Health Emergency and Preparedness Response Authority, HERA, was established by Europe some time ago and has been preparing for the speedier manufacture and production of vaccines to deal with variants in the future, but also to have an expanded provision of vaccines for teenagers and children if authorised by the authorising authorities.  NIAC is currently looking at a vaccination programme for teenagers and children.  Suffice to say, it is our view that we need to purchase a sufficiency of vaccines to take us through 2022 and 2023.  Europe has already reached a deal with Pfizer to provide 900 million vaccines over the next two years.  We have opted in to those pre-purchase agreements and options.  It is good pre-planning by Europe.  We will add any surplus vaccines to our current support for COVAX and for other countries getting vaccinated.  Europe is also providing &euro;1 billion to support and build manufacturing capacity to develop vaccines on the African continent.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Devlin makes a very fair point on investment in the Defence Forces, which we are improving and increasing.  He is correct about the consultations on the next cybersecurity strategy, which had to be delayed because of Covid-19, but it is resuming.  I outlined earlier the work of the commission on the Defence Forces, which is very comprehensive and in line with the programme for Government.  It will also feed into the pay review body, which is also provided for in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I would argue that while some of the postgraduate programmes in medicine are much more expensive than the undergraduate programmes we provided additional places across the board at third level last year and we will do the same this year.  We will do the same in further education and we will increase apprenticeship places as well.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Paul Murphy's point, the Government has been and is concerned about the Delta variant.  We have been monitoring it very carefully.  We set up a special group within the Government comprising senior officials to keep a very close eye on the progress and trajectory of the variant.<\/p> <p>The United Kingdom has slowed down, although its opening was far more advanced than our opening.

It has stopped that because of the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant.<\/p> <p> We are going to have to examine this.  We will take the public health advice.  The CMO and his team are examining this.  The most recent data indicate a higher incidence of the Delta variant now in Ireland, which is a matter of significant concern.  We have to look at this on a number of fronts in terms of our vaccination strategy and in terms of ventilation, absolutely.  We will keep the whole reopening strategy under close review, as we always do, and, as we have said all along, everything we do is subject to ongoing public health advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200021#T00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Council Meeting: Statements","time":1624376400,"counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200022#U00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1624376400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I will attend a meeting of the European Council later this week on 24 and 25 June in Brussels.  At this week&rsquo;s meeting, we will, as has become usual, discuss Covid-19.  This week, our focus will be on vaccination rates across the EU, including in the context of new variants, and on progress on the EU digital Covid certificate, as well as an initial exchange on lessons learnt from the pandemic.  We will also discuss the EU&rsquo;s economic recovery post-pandemic.  We will discuss migration, in particular its external aspects, including our co-operation and support for countries of origin and transit.  We will also return to discussions on relations with Russia, on Turkey and the situation in the eastern Mediterranean more generally, and on the worrying situation in Belarus.  While not part of the formal agenda, the Presidents of the Council and the Commission will brief us on their discussions at the recent G7 meeting, as well as at recent European Union summits with NATO, the US and Canada.  Our meeting will begin on 24 June with an exchange with United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, who was recently re-elected to his post for a second term.  On Friday, 25 June, we will also meet as the Euro Summit in inclusive format.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will provide more detail on Russia, Turkey and Belarus in his concluding remarks this afternoon.  I will address all other agenda items.<\/p>  <p>  Before turning to this week&rsquo;s meeting, let me take the opportunity to report briefly on the special meeting of the European Council that was held on 24 and 25 May.  At that meeting, we discussed Covid-19, including ongoing developments on vaccination across Europe, and the operationalisation of the EU digital Covid certificate this summer.  As we had agreed to do when we met last December, we provided guidance to the European Commission on climate issues ahead of the expected publication of the \"Fit for 55\" package in July.  We discussed Belarus and agreed additional sanctions should be imposed in response to the shocking forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk on 23 May and the detention by Belarusian authorities of journalist Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega.  We held a strategic debate on Russia and restated our commitment to the five principles which have guided the EU&rsquo;s policy towards Russia since 2016.<\/p>  <p>  We had a short discussion on relations with the United Kingdom as they have developed since the end of the period of transition in January.  In this, we reaffirmed that the trade and co-operation agreement, together with the withdrawal agreement and its protocols, provide the framework for EU-UK relations and should be fully and effectively implemented.  I expressed my support for the approach being taken by the Commission and encouraged continued engagement in good faith with the UK.<\/p>  <p>  EU leaders also welcomed the Israel-Palestine ceasefire, which had come into effect in the days before our meeting, following the devastating loss of lives over the preceding weeks.  We reiterated our commitment to a two-state solution and agreed to continue to work with international partners to restart a political process.<\/p>  <p>  We condemned the kidnapping of the transitional President of Mali and the Prime Minister, and called for their immediate release.<\/p>  <p>  In preparation for this week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council, I met last week by video call, VC, with the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the leaders of Estonia, Greece, Poland and Slovenia.  President Michel regularly convenes such meetings with small groups of EU leaders to help prepare the agenda for European Council meetings.  We had a good exchange on the agenda of this week&rsquo;s meeting.<\/p>  <p>  Our meeting this week with UN Secretary General Guterres is a timely opportunity as he starts his new term to exchange views on how the European Union and the United Nations can better work together.  Our discussion will build on the assessment on co-operation between the EU and the UN given by EU High Representative, Josep Borrell, to the UN Security Council on 10 June.  Engagement with the UN is always a vital part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy but, of course, it is particularly important at present due to our membership of the Security Council.  Multilateral and UN-centred responses are essential for responding to complex global challenges in an interconnected and interdependent world.  Since taking up our seat on the UN Security Council on 1 January, Ireland has taken an active role and engaged constructively in the Security Council&rsquo;s work on a range of country situations and thematic issues.  Ireland has also assumed a number of leadership roles on the Security Council, including as facilitator for Security Council activities under Resolution 2231 on the Iran nuclear issue, and as co-penholder, with Norway, on Syria humanitarian resolutions.  I look forward to taking part next week in a debate at the UN Security Council, under the Presidency of my European Council colleague, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia, on \"Maintaining International Peace and Security in Cyberspace\".<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is currently one of three EU member states on the Security Council.  It is important to maintain EU co-operation and ensure a clear European Union voice on the many issues of concern to both the EU and UN.  The EU and UN are key components of a multilateral and international rules-based approach which provides the best protection and response to international peace and security issues, Covid-19 recovery, human rights, sustainable development and climate change.<\/p>  <p>  On Covid-19, this month&rsquo;s meeting will allow for further discussion on epidemiological developments, vaccination programmes and preparations for implementing the EU digital Covid certificate.  The decision that the European Union should come together as one to order and distribute vaccines was the right one, and very much in Ireland's interests.  It has given us access to a portfolio of billions of doses, and deliveries continue to increase.  Well over 355 million doses have already been delivered across the EU and more than 55% of the adult population have received at least one dose.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is the largest exporter of Covid-19 vaccines to the world and will continue its efforts to increase global vaccine production capacities in order to meet global needs.  Hundreds of millions of doses have been exported from the EU around the world to over 90 countries.  Universal and equitable access to safe, effective and affordable diagnostics, treatments and vaccines is crucial in the global fight against Covid-19.  Accelerating work on vaccine sharing and production will be a focus of this week&rsquo;s meeting, including the concrete aim agreed in May of donating at least 100 million doses by the end of the year.  On 4 June, the EU, within the WTO, submitted a proposal to agree on a global trade initiative for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics.  The three key components of this proposal are: ensuring vaccines, treatments and their essential ingredients can cross borders freely; concrete actions to expand production and ensure affordable supply; and clarification and facilitation of TRIPS agreement flexibilities relating to compulsory licenses.  It is clear that production capacity is a key issue, and I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s announcement of &euro;1 billion in funding to create long-term sustainable production capacity in Africa.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has also played a role in responding to the immediate health crisis in a number of countries.  In April, Ireland contributed to EU efforts in providing life-saving equipment to India and, last week, we responded to Nepal&rsquo;s request for assistance from EU member states with donations of medical equipment and PPE.  This material was donated by a number of organisations, including the HSE, and will support front-line workers delivering essential care.<\/p>  <p>  Next week, we will have a first discussion of the lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on an initial report presented by the Commission last week.  We must ensure that we enhance the EU&rsquo;s preparedness, response capability and resilience to future crises. <\/p> <p>While the European Union and its member states have accomplished much during the pandemic, it is clear that the European Union must be better equipped to support our collective efforts in the sphere of public health, while acknowledging areas of national competences.  There is scope to reduce unnecessary duplication of effort across member states, to improve co-ordination, and to harness our collective strengths as we address common challenges.  The success of the vaccination programme shows us what can be achieved when we work together as a Union.<\/p> <p> The Conference on the Future of Europe, which met on Saturday for the first time in plenary session, will no doubt also reflect upon the impact of the pandemic and our collective response during its work.<\/p> <p> On travel, we should acknowledge that the agreement reached on an EU digital Covid certificate is a significant achievement in a short timeframe.  The Government's advice is still to avoid non-essential travel.  Subject to the prevailing public health situation, Ireland will operate the new digital certificate from 19 July for travel originating within the European Union and the EEA.  Ireland will broadly align itself to the European Union approach to non-essential travel into the European Union from third countries, including Great Britain and the United States of America.  This will facilitate the safe return of international travel underpinned by clear safety and public health protocols, including an emergency brake mechanism coordinated at European Union level to react swiftly to epidemiological developments of particular concern.  The Government agreed last week to enhanced quarantine arrangements for passengers arriving from Great Britain.<\/p> <p> This month's European Council will be an important opportunity to take stock of economic developments as we look ahead to the next phase of post-pandemic recovery.  The European Commission presented its European semester spring package on 2 June, with a focus this year on implementation of the &euro;750 billion NextGenerationEU.  Formal ratification of the own resources decision by all member states has cleared the way for European Commission borrowing on the markets to fund the NextGenerationEU package, with an initial &euro;20 billion raised last week.  The Commission has indicated that it will issue approximately &euro;80 billion of long-term bonds this year in addition to significant issuance of shorter-term bonds.<\/p> <p> Most member states have now submitted their national recovery and resilience plans with a view to accessing funding under the recovery and resilience facility, which is the centrepiece of the NextGenerationEU package.  Ireland submitted its draft plan to the European Commission on 28 May.  This has been developed by the Government over recent months, guided by the requirement for a minimum of 37% of expenditure on climate, 20% expenditure on digital investments and reforms, investment and reform challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations to Ireland in recent years, and ensuring alignment with national economic and investment plans, particularly the national economic recovery plan.  Ireland is expected to receive &euro;915 million in grants in 2021 and 2022, which will be used to support investments between now and mid-2026.  Further grants will be allocated in 2023, taking into account economic developments.<\/p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s national recovery and resilience plan proposes investments and reform commitments in three priority areas, which are advancing the green transition; accelerating and expanding digital reforms and transformation; and social and economic recovery and job creation.  The Commission has two months to assess the plan, followed by up to four weeks for member states to consider and approve it following the Commission's assessment.  An initial summary of our draft plan was published earlier this month in conjunction with the Government's economic recovery plan.<\/p> <p> Leaders will meet next Friday for a euro summit, where we will hear from the President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, and from the President of Eurogroup, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  We agreed in March that the focus of this month's discussion would be on post-pandemic economic challenges for the euro area, as well as reviewing progress under the banking union and capital markets union.  The continued activation of the Stability and Growth Pact&rsquo;s general escape clause, this year and next, provides an important window of opportunity for ensuring we continue to have the right mix of monetary, fiscal and structural policies for the period ahead.  This includes a stronger focus on unlocking the full potential of our Single Market, including for next-generation digital services.  I look forward to constructive discussions with leaders to this end.<\/p> <p> Discussion next week will also return to the issue of migration.  Our focus will be mostly on the external aspects of migration.  We will take stock of the migration situation on different routes and will discuss how best to co-operate with third countries to manage this.  In 2019, the number of irregular crossings into the European Union was at its lowest level in six years and this fell further in 2020, largely as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.  However, the number of irregular border crossings at Europe's external borders in the first four months of 2021 reached 36,100, about a third higher than last year, and this is expected to rise further throughout the summer.<\/p> <p> This has, regrettably, brought with it an increase in the number of people who have lost their lives while trying to reach Europe.  Ireland has consistently supported European Union efforts to deal with migration in a comprehensive manner.  This includes the need to make sustainable progress on the challenges posed by irregular and forced migration.  To achieve this, we need to establish and strengthen mutually beneficial partnerships with key third countries.  We recognise the importance of development co-operation in helping to create the conditions in which people do not feel that migration is their only option.  We need to keep a focus on tackling the root causes of forced migration such as conflict and climate change.  However, it is important that we do not let migration define the European Union's relationship with third countries.  It should be only one part of a wider partnership.  In this context, the entry into force of the new neighbourhood, development and international co-operation instrument, known as NDICI-Global Europe, is welcome.  An indicative 10% of the NDICI-Global Europe financial envelope of almost &euro;80 billion for 2021 to 2027 is to be used for migration-related activities.  Ireland looks forward to continued work together as team Europe on this issue.<\/p> <p> I look forward to the opportunity this week of engaging collectively and bilaterally with my European counterparts.  In advance of the formal meeting, I will meet informally with leaders from the six Nordic-Baltic European Union member states, a group with which Ireland shares many policy priorities.  I will report to the House on our discussions next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200022#U00300","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624377000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.  EU leaders will meet at a crucial juncture.  I will raise a number of issues.  As we emerge from the pandemic, we have to plot our way ahead carefully and thoughtfully.  The Council will meet in June, which is the month of Pride.  I cannot let this opportunity go to reiterate our abhorrence towards the discriminatory and bigoted approach adopted by the Hungarian Government in respect of LGBT+ citizens.  I know the Commission is investigating this matter but there have to be consequences for Governments that behave in this way.<\/p>  <p>  As we rebuild, there are opportunities and challenges.  The challenge is to rebuild an economy which is better, stronger and fairer for everyone.  There cannot be a return to the old economy which served a privileged few at the top but failed ordinary workers and families.  We can do better and we must do better.  The focus of our recovery must be on jobs that are secure and well-paid.  Businesses will need to be supported to protect existing jobs and create new ones.  The future is a new green, sustainable economy which can preserve our environment for future generations.  We need a balanced economy, in which rural communities get their fair share of jobs, growth and investment.  We need a specific focus on micro, small and medium businesses, which form the backbone of our economy and economies across Europe.<\/p>  <p>  When we look to the North, we need to work through the challenges and maximise the opportunities of the Irish protocol because business wants the protocol to work and expects political leaders to work together to deliver solutions to the practical challenges they face.  All political parties, bar one, are doing this.  The joint committee has an important job to do.  Neither the DUP nor David Frost speak for the majority of people in the North of Ireland, whether MLAs, businesses or, crucially, citizens on any of these matters.<\/p> <p>Nobody wants recurring extensions of grace periods, which only kick the can further down the road and fail to provide the essential certainty and stability businesses and all of us need.  Through dialogue and engagement, solutions can and must be found and delivered.<\/p> <p> We must also highlight the opportunities the protocol brings to the North.  It places the North in a unique position in respect of access to markets and we need to explore what that can mean for investment and growth.  This week, one of the largest businesses in the North, Dale Farm, won a contract to supply ingredients to a major European company.  InvestNI has spoken of the significant interest it has had from outside investors sparked by the opportunities of the protocol.  There are success stories but we do not often hear them.<\/p> <p> Leaders at the European Council must be in no doubt that contrary to the loudest doomsday voices, the silent majority in the North supports the protocol.  All of us across the island recognise its necessity and that needs to be made clear at the European Council.<\/p> <p> The Council also has an important opportunity to challenge the injustice of the Common Fisheries Policy, a policy that has been devastating for our fishing community.  The Government has sat idly by while a situation has developed in which Ireland has 12% of the waters in the EU but our fishing communities are only allowed to catch 4% of the fish.  This costs our State thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of euro worth of seafood every year.  The Common Fisheries Policy must be revisited.  In the short term, we need equal burden sharing of the loss of fish quotas arising from the EU-British trade and co-operation agreement among the fishing fleets of all member states.  The current situation is unreasonable and Europe must address it.  Ireland must stand up for our fishing communities at the European Council.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach again mentioned the Palestinian situation.  I have said this to him previously, but I wish to say it again.  It is not enough for Europe simply to restate positions and support for a peace process and for a two-state solution.  The challenge for Europe is much more profound than that.  In the face of Israel consistently flouting and breaching international law and in the face of what is an apartheid regime in Israel, what will Europe do?  It is not a question of what it will say, but what it will do.  What will we do?  What will the international community do to bring this to a head and to ensure that Palestinian lives matter, that Palestinian self-determination is realised and that this open wound in the heart of the Middle East that affects all international diplomacy but above all has devastated the lives of men, women and children who have the right to a homeland, who have the right to peace and security, and who have the right to have their human and democratic rights recognised and vindicated?  What will Europe do?  The Taoiseach should ask that question because that is the question on the lips of Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200023#V00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624377600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly, the primary issue facing the EU at this moment continues to be the Covid-19 pandemic followed by how we, both as an independent nation state and as a contributing member of the institution, are to chart the course of economic recovery from the unprecedented events that have occurred since March 2020.  The impact the pandemic has wrought on our economy has been compounded by the added impact of Brexit.  The geographic position that we occupy of having Britain as our nearest neighbour, the political complexities of our relationship with the British and the impact of Brexit on our export economy positions Ireland as the nation most severely impacted by Brexit.  While I welcome the reports that Ireland will receive &euro;1 billion from the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve Fund, it is imperative that these funds find their way to where they are most needed.<\/p>  <p>  Significant issues remain to be resolved relating to access to traditional fishing waters by Irish trawlers as a consequence of the failure to safeguard the rights of Irish fishers.  The impact on our coastal and fishing communities is potentially devastating.<\/p>  <p>  Many of our businesses have made heroic efforts to stay afloat during the pandemic lockdown.  Their ambitions have been reduced to just staying in the game.  This funding must be directed towards keeping people in work and keeping businesses going.  Legislation before the House concerning our maritime jurisdiction offers an opportunity to send a message on the sovereignty of our waters and to put in place the mechanisms required that will allow our nation to harness our natural resources to become a world leader in the development of offshore renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of Covid-19, the global focus is on the vaccination programmes.  The emergence of new more infectious variants of the Covid-19 virus leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that we are in a race against time to administer vaccines globally before a variant emerges that is immune to existing vaccines.  The threat to global health, the economy and social cohesion concerns us all.  Until all are safe, no one is truly safe.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome, therefore, that the European Parliament endorsed a resolution earlier this month calling for a temporary waiver of Covid-19 patents.  The steadfast opposition of the European Commission to this measure is disappointing, even though it alluded to having different plans to accelerate the global vaccine roll-out despite the growing global consensus in favour of the policy of waiving the vaccine patents.  The Government owes an explanation to the House as to why its Members in the European Parliament refused to vote in support of that resolution.  I call on the Taoiseach to answer where Ireland stands following the recent expressions of support for the WTO waiver for Covid-19 vaccines by political leaders in both France and Spain in the aftermath of the adoption of the resolution and the earlier expression of support from the Biden Administration in the US.  <\/p>  <p>  Migration is one of the most important challenges facing the EU.  Conflict, poverty, persecution and global warming have led to the displacement of millions of individuals in recent years.  It is a political, moral and humanitarian issue.  It is also an issue we cannot discuss without broadening the debate to include the role of Turkey and how the EU's dependence on Turkey to act as a bulwark against migrants attempting to gain access to Europe has undermined the ability of the Union to address some of the more provocative actions that Turkey has taken in recent years, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean.  <\/p>  <p>  Just this week, the United Nations Human Rights Council heard from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, that we are heading towards a severe cascading of human rights setbacks across the globe.  The situation has been exacerbated by the human rights agenda of the EU having been compromised by its relationship with and dependency on Turkey to help resolve the issue of migration.  The irony is that the continuing erosion of human rights feeds the flow of refugees.  Last year, even though we were amid a global lockdown due to the pandemic, a staggering 82.4 million people were forced to flee war, violence, extreme poverty and human rights abuses.  More than 500 people have already died this year in attempting to cross into Europe.<\/p>  <p>  We stand on the cusp of potentially horrific humanitarian disasters in both Yemen and Ethiopia.<\/p> <p>The head of the UN has warned that Yemen is facing into the worst famine in decades and that more than 30 million people in the Tigray region remain at risk of famine.  The failure of the EU to use its influence on the global stage to address these issues while simultaneously examining its current migration policy will inevitably lead to a fresh exodus of migrants fleeing the horrors of famine and conflict.  <\/p> <p> The decision of the EU yesterday to renew sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, which have been in place since 2014, stands in stark contrast to the tepid response of the EU in regard to the ongoing annexation and apartheid policies of Israel.  Why can the EU not extend the restrictive measures being imposed on Russia?  EU imports emanating from the areas which have been annexed, along with the infrastructural or financial investments in these areas and exports from the EU for use in transport and telecommunications, gas, oil and mineral exploration, are all included, yet the Irish Government's response to the apartheid policies in Israel is to establish an IDA office there.  This is unacceptable.  The citizens of the West Bank and East Jerusalem are entitled to the same consideration as the citizens of eastern Europe.  Ireland being the first country in Europe to formally recognise the reality of Israel's annexation of Palestinian land has given the Irish Government the imprimatur of the D&aacute;il to use the motion on annexation and take it to the European Council.  The Irish Government can use its voice within the European Union to call for Brussels to support measures to review and downgrade its economic, cultural, military and diplomatic relationships with Israel until the occupation fully ends.<\/p> <p> Ireland can become the first EU country to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements through the enactment of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  The Irish Government has been given the authority to use its voice and seat on the UN Security Council to support the efforts of the International Criminal Court to investigate potential war crimes in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.  It is not good enough to make statements of condemnation and to pass resolutions within this D&aacute;il and not take meaningful action.  The Taoiseach has the mandate of the D&aacute;il to take that voice to the European Council and to urge our European partners to follow suit and take action against the apartheid policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200024#W00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624378200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>As is evident from the Taoiseach's contribution, there is a wide agenda for this week's EU Council meeting.  There will be a sharp focus on Covid-19, the vaccination situation across the European Union and the post-Covid economic recovery plan, all of which relate to our business and our prospects as a country.  A number of related matters are important to us.  I will briefly touch on a few of them.<\/p>  <p>  On the roll-out of the vaccines and vaccine acquisition, after a slow start it is reasonable for the Taoiseach to suggest that the co-operation agreement across Europe in acting jointly on vaccine acquisition has been the right one, but our experience with individual companies has not been uniform.  As it turns out, Pfizer BioNTech has been the workhorse of the vaccine programme in this country and in many others.  Its delivery has been reliable, its word honoured and its contract good.  The same cannot be said of AstraZeneca and that has posed real issues for us.  The cohort of people in their 60s, who are among the most vulnerable in terms of age according to the criteria set by the Taoiseach and the Government, have not been fully vaccinated because they are still awaiting their second dose of AstraZeneca.  I hope that when the Taoiseach or the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, are concluding this debate, they will make it crystal clear that, as per the schedule set out, everyone in that cohort who has received their first dose of AstraZeneca will get their second dose by mid-July, as expected, and that AstraZeneca is committed to providing those vaccines.  In terms of the planning for vaccination next year and so on, the Taoiseach touched on that during Leaders' Questions.  There are questions to be set straight in regard to the necessity for booster doses for those who have received the Janssen vaccine and the availability and timeline for same.  We will return to that on another occasion.  <\/p>  <p>  Another important aspect is the issue of free movement of European citizens, one of the four pillars underpinning the legal framework of the European Union.  The EU digital Covid certificates are to be issued from next month and Ireland is to participate.  I sincerely hope that commitment becomes a reality.  On the post-pandemic recovery plan, there is a lack of clarity in how the financial supports set out are to be made available to Ireland.  The Taoiseach mentioned the recovery and resilience facility.  That facility consists of &euro;672.5 billion, of which less than half, or &euro;312.5 billion, is grant aid.  According to the Taoiseach's statement, of that &euro;672 billion Ireland is to receive of the order of &euro;915 million, which is a very small percentage for Ireland.  According to the EU Commission website, the &euro;915 million is EU and national funds.  I would like to have underscored exactly how much money Ireland will get and when we will get it.  <\/p>  <p>  Other issues that will be discussed include Russia.  The May conclusions pointed to a stark underlining of the worsening of the relationship between the EU and Russia.  In those conclusions, the Council condemns \"illegal, provocative and disruptive Russian activities against the EU, its Member States and beyond\".  Those are very strong words from the EU in relation to Russia.  We have since had the cyberattack on the HSE and the Department of Health.  We understand that the cyberattack emanated from a criminal gang based in St. Petersburg.  Has the Government raised directly with the Russian authorities what action they have taken to find out how this group operates, if they will take action to ensure those involved are brought to justice and if they will co-operate with Ireland in that regard?<\/p>  <p>  Turkey was mentioned.  The human rights record of President Erdo\u011fan is shocking.  We depend on Turkey to absorb migrants that want to come to this country and to the European Union.  I listened to other Deputies mention this and they are right, but the solution to that is not so evident.  If we do not depend on Turkey, what do we do?  There are 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey.  A shocking number of people have been dislocated, thrown out of their own countries fearing persecution.  Not only are there 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, there are 400,000 others from Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere.  We need to have a different dialogue with Turkey and to not become complicit with the human rights abuses that are ongoing in that state.  <\/p>  <p>  In the time remaining to me, I want to mention the Israel-Palestine conflict.  There is a new Israeli Government and, I hope, a prospect for a new initiative.  As I said in the last three contributions I made on this issue, we get very focused when there is conflict and we then lose our focus when the conflict results in ceasefire but the underlying reason for that conflict - the annexation - continues.<\/p> <p>We need a very clear proactive initiative by Ireland and like-minded countries to bring about a two-state solution once and for all, as opposed to the endless talk about such a solution.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to do so in light of the new Israeli Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200025#X00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624378800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I will begin by referring to the previous meeting of the European Council, which was held in May.  It is regrettable that this summit did not reach any substantial conclusions with regard to climate change and reductions in carbon emissions.  The EU agreed last year to reduce carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, having regard to the 1990 levels, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  However, no agreement was reached as to mechanisms to be used to reach these targets.  It is reported that Poland in particular put forward objections on the basis of its continued reliance on coal.  In any event, we await the &quot;Fit for 55&quot; package from the European Commission.  Achieving these targets will be challenging for all member states but we have no choice but to proceed with this agenda with haste.  Ireland in particular is rising to the challenge with the recent passing of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>A lot of time at the May meeting of the European Council was spent discussing the situation in Belarus and the state-sponsored hijacking of a civilian aircraft, which the Taoiseach mentioned.  We cannot move on from this issue.  What do we now know about the fate of the Belarusian journalist and opposition activist, Roman Protasevich, and his partner, Sofia Sapega?  We must continue to call for their release and for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus.  The EU must continue to take strong action to deal with the unacceptable situation in Belarus.  The issue of Belarus must not slip down the EU agenda.  I welcome the commitment the Taoiseach has just made to the effect that Belarus will be on the agenda of this forthcoming meeting of the European Council.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to welcome the outcome of the Brexit adjustment reserve negotiations.  It has been confirmed that Ireland is to receive approximately &euro;1 billion out of a total fund of &euro;5.4 billion.  This is a great achievement for Ireland.  The Taoiseach and all involved in the negotiations, including the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, can be very satisfied with the outcome.  Ireland is one of the member states most affected by Brexit and it is clear that our EU partners have shown solidarity with us.  We now need to ensure that this funding is given to those who need it most.  By this I mean the business and economic sectors most affected by Brexit and, the fishing industry in particular. <\/p><p>US President Joe Biden recently attended the G7 summit in Cornwall.  He went on to have meetings with the EU, NATO and Russian President, Vladimir Putin.  It is welcome that President Biden raised the issue of the Northern Ireland protocol and the Good Friday Agreement with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  He started by proposing a <i>d&eacute;marche<\/i>to the Brexit minister, David Frost.  The President has steadfastly supported the need to implement the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and has requested that the specifics and modalities as to the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol be finalised as soon as possible.  I hope his words will not fall on deaf ears.  In response, the UK Prime Minister said that he will do whatever it takes to protect the territorial integrity of the UK.  This is obviously rhetoric meant more for a domestic audience.  The trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK and the Northern Ireland protocol have nothing to do with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and the Prime Minister knows that.<\/p><p><i>The Irish Times<\/i>reports today that the Taoiseach has suggested to European leaders that an extension to the grace period in which EU regulations governing the importation of chilled meets to Northern Ireland are not applied should be granted.  This is a sensible and practical suggestion.  We need to be sensitive to the political situation in Northern Ireland.  Such an extension would calm tensions and allow for constructive negotiations to continue.  I also welcome the ongoing support and solidarity of EU Heads of Government on this issue.  It is reported that French President, Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President, Charles Michel, all took the UK Prime Minister to task on this matter in their recent meetings with him.  Such solidarity has been unfailing since the Brexit nightmare started on 23 June 2016, five years ago, almost to the day.  <\/p><p>Ireland is not a member of NATO, but we have to take note of the fact that NATO declared China a security threat at its recent meeting.  Of specific concern are the persecution of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.  These concerns were also referred to in the G7 communiqu&eacute;.  There are other concerns about China which I do not want to go into today.  Ireland has good relations with China but we need to highlight these human rights issues at the EU, the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council.  The EU is divided as to how to respond to China's activities at this time for various reasons.  The cornerstones of Irish foreign policy, however, are rules-based multilateral diplomacy and the promotion of basic, fundamental human rights.  Those issues arise to a great degree in respect of China.<\/p><p>I have no doubt but that the European Council meeting will devote some time to the Covid-19 position and the prevalence of the Delta variant.  I ask that the summit take decisions on vaccinations in developing countries and on the question of global vaccine inequity.  As we all know, nobody is safe until everyone is safe.  The COVAX scheme is a good one and it is working but it needs more financial support.  While Europe and the western world generally appear to be getting a grip on the pandemic, the same cannot be said of developing countries.  We are morally bound to assist them financially and in any other way we can.<\/p><p>In passing, I pay tribute to UNICEF for its Get a Vaccine, Give a Vaccine campaign.  The former Minister of State, Peter Power, is the executive director of UNICEF Ireland.  Its advocacy for increased vaccine sharing deserves our support.<\/p><p>I also acknowledge the fact that Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan has now been finalised.  Ireland is to receive &euro;1 billion or thereabouts from the EU's recovery and resilience facility, which is the centrepiece of the next generation EU.  Whatever about its response to the securing of vaccines in the first place, the EU has not been found wanting when it comes to the need for economic recovery following the pandemic.  The initiation of this EU fund is unprecedented in many ways and signals that the EU can effectively respond to crises in a practical and timely way.  The Irish plan aims to advance the green transition, accelerate and expand digital reform and transformation, bring about social and economic recovery and create jobs.  It has been integrated into our recently announced economic recovery plan.  The Government must proceed with all haste to bring about our post-pandemic economic recovery, which all of us await.  <\/p><p>I note that there are several other issues on the agenda of the meeting of the European Council, including relations with Turkey and the issue of migration.  Of course, Turkey has a big role to play in respect of that issue.<\/p> <p>In addition, the summit will revert to the issue of relations with Russia.  That is an issue of much concern to many Deputies and we await the outcomes in that regard.<\/p> <p> I welcome the contribution of the Taoiseach regarding the role Ireland is playing on the UN Security Council.  Ireland is very much active on the global agenda and the issues of the day that are of concern to the United Nations and countries throughout the world.  I believe we are making a major contribution in resolving many of the intractable issues in global politics at this time.  I welcome the report the Taoiseach gave in that regard.<\/p> <p> I wish the Taoiseach well for his meeting.  I have no doubt that he will keep the flag flying.  Obviously, the question of how Europe recovers from the pandemic is big on the agenda, as are the lessons to be learned.  There will be significant changes as a result of all our experiences with the pandemic in terms of work practices and so many other facets of our lives.  It will be interesting to see what the summit comes up with in that regard, how lessons can be learned and how economic recovery will be rolled out for the EU and the member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200026#Y00200","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624379400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Next week, we may have agreement on the next Common Agricultural Policy.  I raised the CAP process with the Taoiseach two weeks ago and he accused me of being anti-European.  I raised the CAP with the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy McConalogue, last week and he accused me of wanting all decisions to be made at European level.  It would be appropriate for Fianna F&aacute;il to learn that it is possible to defend Irish family farmers both at Irish and EU levels.  Given that so many of the policies, standards and regulations that guide the work of family farmers are being decided at European level, it is absolutely appropriate that an Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine would fight on their behalf at EU level.  However, that is not what we have had from the Government.<\/p>  <p>  In fact, one of the first actions of the Taoiseach on taking office last year was to sign off on a really bad European budget deal.  That budget negotiation - I am being generous by referring to it as a negotiation - saw the proportion allocated to agriculture reduce from 37% to 30% and therein lies the crux of the challenges we now face.  There was no word of flexibility on whether Ireland would agree to or have any flexibility regarding how the &euro;13 billion of the so-called common defence fund, the centralised military structure now to be created within the EU, would be allocated.  There was no sense of or argument in terms of flexibility for the hundreds of billions of euro that will be spent on various other streams of the European budget that will bring virtually no benefit to the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  The first indication that the Irish Government was the defender of sovereignty and the need for flexibility at a national level came when at a European level there were proposals that would take money away from those such as Larry Goodman and the sheikhs and put it into the hands of family farmers.  All of a sudden, the Government became the defender of the Irish people.  Of course, that is a ruse because, despite arguing for flexibility and sovereignty, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine acknowledged in the House last week that he has no intention of bringing before the Houses of the Oireachtas the CAP strategic plan that will outline how he intends to use the flexibility for which he has been fighting so hard and actually stalled the CAP talks.  The Minister should speak to his constituents in County Donegal.  What he would hear might surprise him.  They see very little difference in terms of the outworkings of decisions made by bureaucrats in Brussels or in Agriculture House.  They are all bureaucrats at the end of the day.  What people want are decisions that are made in the best interests of rural communities and family farmers.  Therefore, today is an appropriate day for the Government to come clean regarding its intentions.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy McConalogue, appears to be the only person with any interest in Irish farming who does not have a position on the key elements of the next CAP.  He has no position on how much should be redistributed in the context of convergence even though his fellow spokesperson on agriculture while in opposition for Fianna F&aacute;il during the last CAP talks organised public meetings the length and breadth of the country, slamming the then Fine Gael Government for refusing to support redistributive measures.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine appears to be the only person who does not have a position in respect of whether there should be front-loading and what proportion of acreage should be allocated to front-loading, a position and proposition that would disproportionately support and benefit farmers in his constituency.  The Minister says he supports an upper limit CAP payment in terms of the payments that any single entity can receive and that he supports that level being at &euro;60,000 but he has not put on the record clearly that he is going to fight against any discretion or opt-outs that would allow people to continue to draw down the obscene sums that we have again seen in recent weeks.  He still has not articulated whether he has put that proposition to the European negotiations or whether he is willing to stall the negotiations a second time if it means that those on obscene payments would continue to be allowed to do so under the current arrangements.  Next week will tell a big story.  I hope we will finally reach a point where an Irish Government and an Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine go to Brussels and actually fight for Irish family farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200027#Z00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1624379400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach <i>in absentia<\/i>not just for his detailed preview of the upcoming European Council meeting, but also for his review of the previous European Council meeting which I particularly appreciated.  As I said at the time, it was disappointing that the House was unable to have stand-alone statements on it, but I truly appreciate the opportunity the Chamber had to have an extensive and meaningful debate on the situation in Belarus in light of the downing of an Irish-owned aeroplane there.  I look forward to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in terms of a further update on the situation in Belarus and activity at a European level in respect of how we can continue to tackle the flagrant breaches of international law as well the absolutely despotic regime being run by a dictator in Belarus.  Ireland has a strong and prominent role to play in this regard.  This cannot be simply a one-time-only debate that we ignore when the issue no longer seems apparent.  We have deep and meaningful ties to that part of the world and, moreover, the very worrying contagion that comes out of such a regime in Belarus and the efforts of non-state actors supported and protected by the regime in Belarus and the money men in Moscow is extremely concerning.  One only has to look to the recent cyberattack on the HSE to see exactly how damaging that can be for all in society.<\/p><p>The first issue on which I wish to focus in advance of the very important meeting of the European Council later this week is, obviously, that of the pandemic.  There is much to compare and discuss in spite of the air of cautious optimism in this country that the vaccination rate is going extremely well.  The HSE and all those involved deserve much credit in that regard.  I am delighted, as, I am sure, is the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, that the vaccination programme has made its way down to registering those in their 30s, although the Minister of State may have a while to wait yet.  A significant part of this issue is a reopening strategy across Europe in the context of looking at other European countries that got things right and taking the warnings where they got things wrong.  I know many Members may be quite envious to see crowds of 12,000, 25,000 or even full stadiums at the European Championships while we are still running test events.  It is disappointing but perhaps it shows what we can achieve and how we can work against the very worrying rise of the Delta variant.<\/p><p>In his opening remarks, the Taoiseach referred to the progress on the digital Covid certificate.  I have no doubt many Members will refer to this issue in this debate and have consistently raised it in recent months.  It is vital for Ireland on every level.<\/p> <p>We think in this regard of our airline industry, which has been decimated, and our airline staff, whose representatives we have all met outside both this building and Leinster House in recent weeks.  We think about the correspondence we have received.  Crucially, we think about those who have been apart from loved ones for more than a year.  We also think about the many small and medium-sized businesses up and down the country that depend on safe and reliable overseas visits for their patronage.<\/p> <p> I want to raise an issue on which I am seeking clarity and in respect of which the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, said earlier today on the radio that there are plans afoot.  I refer to the need to ensure the digital Covid certificate is available to Irish citizens around the world who have received recognised vaccinations.  Among the people who may not have been vaccinated in this jurisdiction are Irish citizens living in the UK who have had an EU-approved vaccine, whether AstraZeneca or otherwise.  They must be able to access the digital certificate.  It is crucial that people in Ireland have access to the certificate, as well as those in Northern Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, whether we can get clarification that people in Northern Ireland will be allowed to access the digital Covid certificate.  This issue has been raised a number of times by my colleague, Senator Currie, in the Upper House.  It is vitally important that we have an element of joined-up thinking on this island when it comes to the digital certification system.  In dealing with the pandemic, we have seen that when we worked together, when, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Swann, had meetings together, it was for the betterment of everyone on this island.<\/p> <p> The issue into which I will segue from that point relates to the discussions on economic recovery that are due to take place at the Council meeting.  We had a lengthy, although slightly fragmented, debate in this Chamber on the EU's recovery and resilience plan.  It kind of became a free-for-all discussion on the national development plan and every sort of funding that may be available.  The &euro;950 million allocated to Ireland under the recovery and resilience scheme is vital and we must see progress in that regard at European level.  We need that funding at this critical time, as we come out of the pandemic.  Crucially, and I hate to say it, we need to have the preparations done and everything in place for the next time we may need that type of funding.  The groundbreaking decision that the EU would be able to generate own resources and float eurobonds is very welcome, particularly for a small member state such as Ireland that has, at times, borne the brunt of European solidarity in terms of the response to the financial crisis.  It is an important development for the whole of the EU and it provides a major opportunity.<\/p> <p> In that context, we must also pay close attention to the delivery of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  The funding of more than &euro;1 billion announced last week for Ireland, which makes us the member state getting the largest part of the first &euro;5 billion tranche, is important.  We will have to wait a couple of months until we see those funds in accounts, which is completely understandable.  I would like to see a discussion taking place on this issue at European Council level and Eurogroup level.  I understand the latter is to meet with the Council in due course.  We need to ensure account is taken of the sectors in Ireland that need the supports available under the Brexit adjustment reserve.  I refer to the sectors most impacted by Brexit, including agrifood, and logistics and freight exports.  We need to consider how we can use the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, together with the overall recovery and resilience fund and, indeed, the general Government strategy, to mitigate the difficulties and challenges associated with the sorry state of affairs that is Brexit but also to realise the opportunities that arise out of it.<\/p> <p> We must use European Council meetings and any other opportunity we can to ensure we make the most of Irish exporters having access to the word's largest economic bloc.  The volume of exports from Ireland to the Continent simply must increase.  They are at record levels but we can do much more.  There are traditional markets and products in respect of which Ireland has good business relations on the Continent, including in France and Germany, but we also need to look further afield.  We must look at the requirements of other large European economies, where, I would argue respectfully, we are simply not performing.  We can do much more, for instance, in the Nordic countries.  I note that the Taoiseach is to have a side meeting with the Nordic Prime Ministers.  There are huge opportunities in that regard.  We also need to look at countries such as Italy and Poland and how we can further develop our trade with them.  I repeat my call that the overall review of our foreign missions should consider the additional economic and consular opportunities that arise, having regard to the success of the second consulate offices in Lyons and Frankfurt and, in particular, the additional consulates in Great Britain, in Cardiff and Edinburgh, with another soon to be opened in the northern powerhouse region.  We need to see much more of that happening across the Continent.  We must, in due course, have consulates in Barcelona, Milan, Gdansk and the many other cities that offer real opportunities for Irish businesses impacted by Brexit to diversify and reap the opportunities of access to the world's largest economic bloc, the Single Market.<\/p> <p> A very important issue that will, of course, be discussed at the upcoming Council meeting is one the Taoiseach referred to in the opening lines of his statement.  That is the fallout, for want of a better word, from the G7 summit ten days ago.  We have discussed it in this Chamber and in a range of contexts.  We must be serious in expressing to our European colleagues that significant concerns remain in this Parliament and this country regarding the impact of the British Government's treatment of the Northern Ireland protocol to the withdrawal agreement.  Even today, we see Lord Frost continuing to operate as a one-man propaganda machine in doing down the very protocol he negotiated and criticising the EU.  He should be back in the room, whether with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d or with people on the British side such as Michael Gove and the Prime Minister, talking about what this British Government negotiated and ratified, on the basis of which it won an 80-seat majority.<\/p> <p> We must look at the areas of the protocol that need to be implemented.  A very interesting study was released recently, with comments by Matthew O'Toole, an MLA in the Northern Ireland Assembly, about how no one is talking up the advantages of the protocol for Northern Ireland.  We have seen, for example, a massive investment in one Northern Irish factory that produces whey protein and all the opportunities it will have to export, not just to the market in Great Britain but also to the Single Market.  The message that must come from the European Council is the same message we have been getting from our European partners, including the Heads of State in Germany, Italy and France as well as the European Commission and Council Presidents, all of whom attended the G7 summit, namely, that the British obligations under the protocol simply must be met.  We appreciate that things are difficult in Northern Ireland.  There is, to put it mildly, an ongoing element of change in political unionism.  Where there are concerns, they should, of course, be addressed.  Ireland should always play a proactive and productive role within European circles to ensure the protocol is applied reasonably.  However, that comes with the requirement that the British Government meet its legal obligations and act responsibly in respect of the international treaty it signed months ago.<\/p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to address the House and the Taoiseach for his remarks.  I look forward to the reply from the Minister of State in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200027#Z00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624380000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I want to discuss two issues.  The first is the upcoming review of the EU's fiscal rules and the second is the reforms Ireland was requested to make as a requirement of accessing the Recovery and Resilience Facility.  In March last year, the European Commission suspended the fiscal rules by activating the general escape clause.  Those rules place limitations on member states' deficit and debt levels and, as such, have a significant impact on the economic performance of member states and the EU as a whole.  There was some irony in the timing of the suspension, as it occurred just as the long-awaited review of the fiscal governance framework was to begin.  The speed at which the rules were suspended gives a clear indication of their procyclical nature.  There was widespread recognition that, following the previous financial crisis, they served to stymie recovery, acted as a rationale for austerity and meant the eurozone spent a decade teetering on the brink.  Fortunately, last year's suspension of the rules allowed member states to engage in the kind of countercyclical deficit spending that was necessary to prevent the worst from happening.  The President of the Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, said at the time that \"national governments can pump [money] into the economy as much as they need\".  It goes without saying that this was a far cry from the response to the previous crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The review of the fiscal rules is scheduled to recommence later this summer.  The Commission is widely expected to put forward proposals for simplifying the rules, thereby providing greater incentives for productive investment and changes to debt levels.  The question is whether the changes will go far enough.  The European Parliament has just produced its draft report containing proposals for reform and I was very disappointed to see they do not go nearly far enough.  The Commission will soon seek submissions from members states and interested parties and it is essential that this State has its say.  I hope the Government will outline what its position will be in this regard.  The rules are now nearly 30 years old and, as long as they have been with us, so, too, have been the calls for their reform.<\/p> <p>Reforms proposed have included exempting public investment, cyclically adjusting the 3% ceiling, shifting from a deficit ceiling to a public debt ceiling, swapping the system of fiscal rules for fiscal standards, and so on.  <br\/><br\/>At a bare minimum, we need to introduce a golden rule that would exempt member state investment in green and social capital infrastructure from debt and deficit considerations.  I cannot see how a new European green deal and just transition will be possible without such a measure.  The report of the European Parliament considers a golden rule, but it is so restrictive that it is unlikely that most member states will qualify.  In the absence of this, I cannot see how we will reach our climate targets.  Yet, I already detect the obsession with fiscal discipline being prioritised above all other concerns.  That is creeping back in.  It is exemplified in the article by former German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, published recently in <i>The Financial Times<\/i>, which called for a hasty return to fiscal contraction.  Thankfully, a response was written and signed by almost 150 economists, stating that the exact opposite of that is what is now required.  Not only does Europe need expansionary fiscal policies, we need fiscal rules that support public investment and do not straight-jacket policymakers from engaging in the kind of expenditure required to meet the needs of the moment.  We need more economic sovereignty to make decisions based on our conditions and needs.  <br\/><br\/>Lastly, I wish to address the issue of the conditionality that was attached to the access of states to the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the concerning request by the Government for confidentiality.  The European Council examined the recovery plans for the EU.  The Government has now submitted its plans.  It has been confirmed that Ireland requested the Commission to redact certain sensitive information from its recovery and resilience plan as officially submitted on 28 May 2021.  It is deeply concerning that such a large amount of public money is subject to privacy conditions.  We need confirmation of when the entire plan will be published.  We need a full list, without any redactions, of the reforms that the State has committed to implementing.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the EU's so-called country-specific recommendations made specific demands on Ireland to reform certain tax rules and schemes.  A full account must be given of how the Government intends to meet these recommendations in its national plan through changes to tax law over the coming years.  The fund is significant and it is a welcome aid to our recovery, but the people must know what agreements were reached in return for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200028#AA00200","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624380600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a specific question that was put to me.  I do not expect the Minister of State to answer now, but I would appreciate it if he could get back to me.  On the issue of the EU digital Covid certificate and plans for travel within the EU, a person asked me  very valid question.  In the case of a person who has been told by their doctor - not through scepticism about vaccines - that because of a particular condition they have, they cannot be vaccinated, is that person going to be discriminated against in their ability to travel, when others who are vaccinated are allowed to travel?  It is a fair question.  People who are in that situation deserve an answer on it.  They should not be discriminated against.  If it is decided at a certain point that based on vaccination, people are allowed to travel, or particular conditions around international travel resuming within the EU, green listed countries or whatever are introduced, there should not be unfair discrimination against people who, through no fault of their own and because of particular conditions, are unable to be vaccinated.  That is a specific question on which I hope to get a response.<\/p>  <p>  The main point I wish to make concerns the references to Palestine and the discussions around Palestine.  The Taoiseach's references to the discussion were fairly minimal in just saying that there was a restatement of the commitment to the two-state solution.  I wish to assert that the two-state solution is not a solution.  It has been tried since the Oslo Accords were concluded and it has been an absolute disaster.  By the way, it essentially legitimises and accepts the principal of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and the ethnic-religious partition of people who used to live in one country as equals, but who were ethnically partitioned.  Imagine if somebody said that the two-state solution in Ireland was a legitimate solution.  I think many of us would baulk at that.  Yet, we continue to go on about a two-state solution, which is, in effect, legitimising and endorsing the ethnic-religious partition of the land of Palestine.  In fact, to my mind, it is the main basis on which Israel continues to seize Palestinian land and ethnically cleanse Palestinians.  It reinforces the idea that because at some point borders will be fixed, Israel should grab as much land and ethnically cleanse as many Palestinians as possible.  It is having disastrous consequences.  Therefore, it is time to question the two-state solution as an absolutely failed and dangerous fantasy and to start to talk about equality of everybody in the historic land of Palestine, whether they are Jews, Arabs, Christians or have no religion.  We would not accept anything less anywhere else in the world.  Why do we accept the idea of ethnic cleansing and ethnic partition which has been so disastrous for the Palestinians?  <\/p>  <p>  In that regard, I also ask the Taoiseach why we are practising apartheid against Palestinians when it comes to access to the EU.  Israelis have a visa waiver coming into the EU, but Palestinians do not.  Why are we discriminating in favour of Israel in that regard, as against Palestinians?  Is that not a case of apartheid being practised by Europe and should it not cease?  If we are serious about seeing people as equals in the historic land of Palestine, Israel or whatever you want to call it, why are we treating those two groups of people differently, particularly when Israel behaves quite disgracefully towards EU passport holders who happen to be of Palestinian origin and who enter Israel trying to access the West Bank or Gaza?<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I appeal to the Government to do everything it can to assist the people of Gaza in the reconstruction effort.  Gaza has suffered four attacks in the past 12 years.  In the latest attack, 1,148 houses were destroyed, 15,000 were damaged and 100,000 people were displaced.  In many cases, people had their homes destroyed for the second, third or fourth time.  We urgently need to get assistance to the people of Gaza to help reconstruct their shattered society, particularly in the area of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200029#BB00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1624380600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>June is Pride month throughout the world.  It is 52 years this month since the Stonewall uprising, when LGBTQ+ people in New York city rose up against police harassment and violence.  Since that time, the movement for gay liberation has spread to every country in the world.  Every June, the community celebrates and takes stock of the journey travelled and the journey yet to come.  Stonewall's tradition of resistance and struggle lives on, despite attempts by the corporate world to co-opt and monetise the issues.  Here in Ireland, much has been achieved, but homophobia is still alive and kicking, as shown by recent events in Waterford and Ballyfermot.  Meanwhile, the Government failed to challenge the homophobia of the church's new sex education programme for our schools or to insist on objective, factual sex education for our students.<\/p>  <p>  The EU projects itself as modern and liberal, yet same-sex unions have not been legalised in five countries and same-sex marriage has not been legalised in 13 countries.  In Poland, there is a state-sponsored ideological war against the LGBTQ+ community, and so, too, in Hungary, which banned adoption for same-sex couples late last year and now has banned what it describes as \"the display and promotion of homosexuality\" among under 18s, thereby criminalising large numbers of young gay people in that country.<\/p>  <p>  EU governments have been far too quiet on the issue.  The Irish Government has been far too quiet on it.  What does the Minister of State intend to say and do at the European Council?

That is very true for Ireland.  The pandemic has left a trail of damage in its wake, taking the lives of thousands in Ireland and hundreds of thousands across the European bloc.  This has brought significant suffering to Europeans, presenting fundamental challenges to our economy and our way of life.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of this crisis, EU member states have acted in good faith with one another, working together to share information and respond to an unprecedented challenge not seen in the past century.  The development of more reliable vaccines in a short time has been nothing short of remarkable.  Moreover, the ability we have demonstrated in terms of solidarity, bearing in mind some early bumps on the road in terms of supply, to efficiently roll out a vaccine to our peoples has given real hope for a timely and much wanted return to an open society.<\/p>  <p>  As a united bloc, we must now consider the medium-term prospects for the Irish and European vaccination programmes and the economy, both of which are intrinsically linked.  I believe in a strong vaccination response, one that avails of continued co-operation with nation states outside of the EU, as well as pharmaceutical companies and production sites.  We cannot have certainty without open dialogue.  I urge all of our partners to continue to engage with each other to avoid any potential pitfalls.<\/p>  <p>  I also believe that we in Europe are among the most privileged in the context of vaccines.  From such a position, it is, therefore, right that we ask if we can do more to help ease the burden on nations still struggling to control the virus.  Encouraging a global take-up of vaccines in as short a time as possible will benefit everyone living in Europe and allow us to avoid delays in our reopening.  We know that it is a matter of time before further Covid-19 variants emerge.  We do not yet know what some of these variants might look like and what might be the ramifications of a further aggressive strain emerging.  That is why we must act.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union has the means and capability to extend the hand of friendship around the world and supply millions with protection from Covid-19 which will, in turn, leave a legacy of hope in what has been an incredibly difficult time for the world.  I commend organisations such as UNICEF on their efforts in providing vaccines to the most vulnerable around the world.  I hope Ireland can also bring the issue to the heart of the UN and advocate for those very same people.  I am aware of COVAX and the European Union's ambition but I would like to see more being done.  Allowing other countries with the facilities to produce vaccines the ability to do so through waiving vaccine patents is a step which should be encouraged.  Like all Members, I was very heartened by the steps in some jurisdictions and by some companies in this regard.  This can transform the speed at which we can reduce the impact of Covid-19 on lives around the world.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke earlier about the unity in which the EU has acted throughout the pandemic.  We are already on the path to dealing with the recovery in a united manner.  This is evidenced in the EU recovery and resilience plan under which approximately &euro;750 billion will be provided, of which Ireland will receive nearly &euro;1 billion.  However, I would repeat that which has been said by some of my colleagues on the detail of that &euro;917 million package.  The House has not had the opportunity to assess that or to determine what is appropriate in terms of where the money should be expended.  I note from attending various committees over the past number of weeks that no committee has been provided with any information.  That is somewhat of a short-sighted approach to the provision of almost &euro;1 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Despite these positive developments, there remains a clear difference between Ireland and the rest of the EU in respect of one critical sector of the economy.  The Ceann Comhairle will not be surprised to hear that is aviation, an issue which I have raised in this House on many occasions over the past number of months.  As has been said countless times over the past 18 months, it was the first and most badly affected industries in Ireland.  However, unlike many industries that were severely curtailed, the aviation sector remains in a situation where it is unclear as to many of the aspects on which it requires clarity in order to fully restore it to its previous position of strength.  Recent reports regarding air traffic in the EU suggest we saw a recovery of up to 50% as compared to 2019.  Air traffic in Ireland, however, is expected to lag behind this average recovering to just 43%.  More disturbing are the recent published figures from the Central Statistics Office which showed that, in April of this year, daily passenger traffic through Irish airports stood at just 4,700 people.  This represents just 4.5% compared to the level seen in 2019.  At that same moment in April of this year, American Airlines was hiring new pilots.<\/p>  <p>  These figures and facts cannot be ignored.  The alarm bells are ringing and the industry is calling on us to act.  Thousands of jobs are on the line on top of the 4,000 already lost.  Providing a clear path to restoring consistent and safe travel in Ireland is of paramount need.  We must learn from the experiences of other nations and use all available to tools to deal with the issue with the urgency it requires. <\/p>  <p>  While I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has written to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, requesting a trial of antigen testing within the aviation sector, I believe it is several months too late and most certainly will be too late for some within the sector.  It is my firm belief that Ireland should introduce antigen testing for the aviation industry, most especially for vaccinated individuals.  I listened carefully to the transport committee hearing with Dr. Holohan and his colleagues last week.  What was effectively discussed was a second layer of testing alongside PCR.  I do not think that is what other EU nations are doing and I am not convinced it is what we should be doing, particularly as it applies to individuals who have been vaccinated.  We lag behind many of our European partners in this respect.<\/p>  <p>  We will reap the consequences of that in the event that we do not regularise antigen testing in our travel hubs.  Further clarity must also be given with respect to children who are travelling.  We must acknowledge that children will be among the last to be vaccinated.  While in Europe many parents of young children are vaccinated or due to be vaccinated shortly, this underscores the importance of setting coherent plans for travel.  It will provide clarity to both passengers and the industry as more people begin to plan a return to international travel on 19 July.<\/p>  <p>  If we are sincere in our commitment to the aviation sector, we must recognise its extraordinary contribution to the Irish economy in supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs, creating billions of euro in revenue and connecting Ireland to the world.  We must put into action what we commit to and deliver results for the industry which we desperately need to help at this time.  An assistance scheme for testing for travel should be provided, as has been provided in other EU member states.  I would like to see Ireland follow those countries.  We are an island off the coast of the world.  We need our aviation sector and we need to find supports for it.  We need these in place before 19 July.<\/p>  <p>  The digital green certificate is a welcome EU initiative and there is clearly a place for more information to be provided to the public in advance of unfettered travel in July.  It is incumbent on the Government to move appropriately to provide the public information campaign in due course.  As we begin to look towards an increase in return to international travel, the EU should engage with our partners around the world, most notably the UK and the United States, in order to facilitate reciprocal agreements and recognition of official documentation.  The upcoming EU meeting this week is another opportunity to press for these developments which will contribute to providing certainty for the wider travel and hospitality sector.  Our hospitality sector is important and will have a good summer with domestic travel.  It will benefit even more, however, with international travel to these shores.<\/p>  <p>  Also to be discussed at this upcoming meeting will be the increasing belligerent behaviour of the Russian Government.  For some years now we have seen Russia threaten countries attempting to move towards EU values, interfere with the domestic democratic processes of EU member states and exert its influence on its own people, notably journalists and opposition leaders.  We cannot stand by and allow this behaviour to go unchecked.  To do so would be to encourage all those who have been unfaithful to the principles of democracy around the world, as well as here in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Russia is interested in destabilising the EU because all governments which lean towards authoritarianism fear the values that we hold dear, namely, a free press, an independent judiciary and the right of people to freely choose their leaders.  We in Europe learn these developments and values the hard way.  We saw the suffering and pain caused by extreme political ideologies and undemocratic leaders.  We resolved to build a better union, one in which freedom is paramount and despots are unwelcome.  Unfortunately, some lessons of the past cannot be forgotten.<\/p> <p>We now see member states, namely, Hungary and Poland, in direct contradiction of the values of the EU.  We see those attacks on media and on the courts in an effort to suppress criticism of the government and we should be under no illusion that these events have been welcomed in Russia.  We must send a clear message to Russia, in respect of those who would do their bidding in Europe, that their actions will be met by repercussions.<\/p> <p> In my remaining minute, I want to talk briefly about solidarity with members of the LGBTQ+ community across Europe.  We have seen infringement of their rights in two member states and have seen further infringements of their rights across other member states in recent months and years.  In Pride month it is appropriate for me, as a member of Parliament in Ireland, to stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters in the gay community right across Europe because it is very important that we recognise that we are all equal and the laws should reflect that.  That is why it is particularly disheartening to see a country like Poland and other countries act in contradiction of the principles of the EU.  There is a context for a wider debate on how there could be consequences for an EU member state if it is found to be acting in a way that is unfitting with the principles of the EU.<\/p> <p> I wish the Taoiseach well in his upcoming EU meeting and I look forward to our continued co-operation with our EU partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200030#CC00100","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624381800,"counter":218,"content":"<p> As antigen testing was raised, the only commentary I will make is that it has been a tool that we have missed in the opening up of society but it may have a particular fit for aviation.  We all know NPHET's view on it at this stage, and Dr. Tony Holohan stated that there is an insufficient amount of evidence on antigen testing, particularly around travel and aviation.  There has been a failure and this needs to be rectified quickly, even if it is very late from the point of view of putting a proper pilot testing scenario in place to provide the evidence, so that it can be audited properly and, if as many of us believe, antigen testing is proved to be useful for aviation, that it is put in place.  That needs to be done as quickly as possible as we are way behind the curve on it.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the move that is to be made on the digital Covid-19 certificate.  It is Europe operating at its best when one has an element of working together and one has a sensible solution that will be operated throughout the European Union.  We need to ensure that there are no hiccups from our end and that all of the technicalities and the logistics are put in place as soon as possible.  Communication with all stakeholders is necessary.  In regard to 19 July, we need to accept that the aviation sector has been significantly hammered and it does not need anything to happen beyond what has happened with Covid-19.  That which is within our control needs to be sorted out.  We need to ensure we deliver for this sector.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about certain difficulties around the recovery and resilience funding.  We all welcome the &euro;1 billion funding from the Brexit adjustment reserve fund but we have to ensure that we put these funds where they are necessary from the point of view of economic recovery.  A significant amount of work still needs to be done on that.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned Brexit.  We received great solidarity from across Europe and we have heard the recent statements from Boris Johnson and David Frost.  We have also heard these statements from certain elements of unionism as it goes through the particular difficulties it has at this point in time.  On some level, the British Government is probably providing succour, in that people believe there is a major political move that can be made on the Irish protocol.  This protocol is like the Good Friday Agreement which is there to stay.  Solutions will be found to whatever difficulties there are.  We need to ensure we maintain that element of solidarity and that Britain is left in no doubt that solutions will be found but that the Irish protocol is there to stay.  This, to me, is continuity of the failure of British rule in Ireland and the absolute failure of partition.  Once again we will have to have a proper and real conversation on what a united Ireland will look like and which allow everybody to be part of the conversation.  Then we can have a plan.  Eventually, we will have a referendum.  Everybody in the wider world believes it is going to happen so we need to have a bit of reality check.  In this House, I recognise there have been moves by certain political elements, which are very welcome.  We need to have this conversation, to have the plan and to deliver, following 100 years of absolute failure.<\/p>  <p>  We really need to look at a TRIPS waiver, even if it is temporary, to ensure the steadiest and biggest supply of vaccines is delivered across the world.  This State, and across this island, we are in a race of vaccines versus the Delta variant.  We need to ensure we reduce the number of variants across the world and that we bring every other state and nation to the place we are in now because none of us are safe until all of us are safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200031#DD00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1624381800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>As we do not have anybody from the Regional Group offering our next contributor is Deputy Mattie McGrath who is sharing with Deputies Michael Collins and O'Donoghue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200031#DD00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1624381800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>T&aacute; ceist mh&oacute;r agam i gcomhair an Aire St&aacute;it.

The European Commission announced on 28 May that it had received an official recovery and resilience plan from Ireland and Sweden.

Will the leaders examine which route has resulted in the most deaths?  Are some routes safer for children and babies or is there a data-deficit because bodies have not yet washed up on shores?  That may sound callous and facetious, but the EU's migration policies are callous, cruel and inhumane.  No doubt, the leaders will examine which routes can be easily closed.<\/p>  <p>  The EU leaders will discuss the implementation of Next Generation EU and recommendations on the economic policy of the eurozone area.  They will talk about the impact of Covid-19 on our economies and the challenges we face, and review progress made on the banking union and the capital markets union.  Will that discussion involve how to make policy more responsive to citizens than to banks and capital markets?<\/p>  <p>  On 25 March 2021, the Council issued a statement about discussions on relations with Turkey, while at the end of May 2021, it was decided that relations with Russia would be discussed again.  Is it not remarkable that an EU member state that has been a member for 17 years could introduce legislation that discriminates against the LGBTQI+ community?  Just last week, Hungary voted for regressive measures for members of that community who under the age of 18.  Similarly, Poland has also been a member state since 2004 and has been allowed to flout common decency and human rights legislation by having designated LGBT-free zones.  The Hungarian Government has stated that anything that &ldquo;promotes deviation from gender identity, gender reassignment and homosexuality shall not be made available to persons under the age of 18.&rdquo;  A Hungarian LGBT+ group, the H&aacute;tt&eacute;r Society, surveyed about 2,000 people and found that 42% had thought about suicide and 30% had attempted it.  The survey found that 64% of the respondents who had thought about suicide were teenagers.  That is shocking and it should be discussed at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  This month is Pride month, and people ask why Pride is still needed.  Pride is a protest, and Irish EU leaders must make a stand at this month's Council against these dangerous, outdated and disgusting laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200032#EE00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1624382400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.  I have read a copy of the Taoiseach's contribution and it contains some welcome aspects.  What stood out for me was that he stated that next week, we will have a first discussion of the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on an initial report.  If we have learned anything from this time, it was that we were utterly unprepared for such a pandemic because of our failure in this country to invest in public health and our hospitals.  We will recall what the World Health Organization stated more than a year ago, namely, that the failure to act, on the part of Ireland and other countries, was truly shocking.  I would like to see a transformative action emerge from the Council meeting in order that language will mean something.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other issues I would like to address but time is limited and some of them, relating to Hungary and Poland and refugees, were mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Pringle.  Some 60 million people have now been displaced, the highest number since the Second World War.  I will use the brief time that remains to focus on Colombia.  I am surprised and shocked that the Taoiseach did not mention the country, given the level of unrest, violence and deaths that has obtained there in the past while, and particularly since April of this year.  I acknowledge that the former T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party is the EU envoy and that he is deepening his understanding of Colombia in regard to this matter as we speak.  Nevertheless, our role on the UN Security Council is a very special and privileged one.  We secured it because of hard work on the part of the Government but also because we are respected as an independent voice.<\/p>  <p>  I ask that we use that voice and that, at the very least, Colombia be put down on as the number one item on the agenda of the next Council meeting.  The figures are horrific.  The latest protest followed on from those in 2019 and 2020, but the current unrest began at the end of April.  Human Rights Watch has stated that 34 deaths occurred in the context of the recent protest, comprising two officers, one criminal investigator and 31 demonstrators or bystanders.  There are many other figures I could quote but time is limited, so I will outline what two non-governmental organisations on the ground have stated.  They are highly respected NGOs.  They have stated that 43 massacres have been committed in Colombia this year alone, with 164 victims.  They define a massacre as the killing of three or more people in the same place at the same time.<\/p>  <p>  The protest has become a massive movement for change.  I ask that it be put on the agenda of EU meetings and that we have reports back.  Will the Minister of State clarify when the Minister for Foreign Affairs will report back to the House regarding his role on the UN Security Council?  How are topics on that body's agenda determined?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200032#EE00400","speaker":"1577"}]
