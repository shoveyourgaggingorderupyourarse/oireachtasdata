In this regard, the Revenue Commissioners have undertaken significant preparations to date, with work intensifying in recent months.  With resource requirements, the Revenue Commissioners determine that an additional 600 staff will be required to manage the impact of Brexit.  Those staff are to be deployed on a phased basis up to the end of December 2020.  It is estimated that approximately half the staff will be assigned to import and export trade facilitation activities and half to national divisions that will be engaged in trade facilitation, customs control and oversight activities, including at specific trade or case level.  I am advised that Revenue has accelerated and expanded their recruitment and training schedules to meet the 29 March deadline, and will deliver the target of 400 additional staff in place by that point.  The balancing complement of additional staff will be recruited during the rest of the year.<\/p>  <p>  During 2018, the Revenue Commissioners chaired an interdepartmental group that was established to consider the adequacy of port and airport infrastructure and facilities post Brexit.  The group considered both the central case and no-deal scenarios.  Infrastructure requirements were necessary at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport.  Intensive work is under way to have the infrastructure in place by 29 March and this work is now being led by the Office of Public Works.  Significant work has happened to upgrade our IT systems to have advanced systems in place.  I am assured by Revenue that their IT systems will have the required capacity to manage the increased transaction levels which are anticipated in a no-deal scenario, and this will be in place by 29 March.<\/p>  <p>  Allied to this work, Revenue have undertaken significant trader engagement by working closely with businesses, trade and representative bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400003#A00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1550140200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The chairman of Revenue told us that they estimate some 70,000 Irish SMEs traded with the UK in 2017.

Failing that, massive change is needed to ensure that any type of consumer protection, or indeed human rights protection, is weaved into it.  The proposal represents the EU at its worst.  It is simply about the needs of capital, and to hell with the ordinary people.  This Parliament supported my No Consent, No Sale Bill, which represents an approach that has consumer protection, not bank protection, at its heart, its core.

Will the Minister accept that when the public hears these kinds of sums being thrown around for private consultancy firms it does nothing to persuade people that any meaningful value for money takes place at all?<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister also explain why there appears to be a huge overlap in relation to work being undertaken by different consultancy firms, in case the Minister thinks that I am picking on PwC, which I am not?  For example, last year, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform paid Gartner &euro;182,000 for advisory services.  It also paid Horizon Energy &euro;230,000.  What is all this money for?

The transaction was a further move by the NTMA to diversify its issuance, access a new category of investor and provide a new debt instrument to meet untapped investor demand.  The accessing of these investors is important given the increased focus of investors and funds on environmentally sustainable investments.  It is important that Ireland is one of the first sovereign States to meet this demand.<\/p>  <p>  An allocation report will be made available to investors annually until an amount equal to the net proceeds of the Irish sovereign green bond has been fully allocated.

Yesterday, I raised with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport the possibility of a metro loop on the southside of Dublin.  Rather than stopping the underground in Charlemont Street or Ranelagh, it could be extended to Terenure, Templeogue and Tallaght on the south west, loop around via Sandyford and University College Dublin and return to the city centre.  While that sounds grandiose, it is what we need on the southside of Dublin to make public transport work.  Despite all the public transport projects in the current plan, the National Transport Authority sent me a letter in which it predicted that there would still be a 30% increase in transport emissions in Dublin by 2040.  We need, therefore, to think bigger and metro is just the sort of project that green bond could help finance.<\/p>  <p>  We need to develop massive offshore wind resources, much of which can be done by the private sector through auctions but we should own the transmission grid to ship that power to the rest of Europe because we have a comparative advantage.

The green bond, and the way we have structured it, has really pushed the envelope and the framework for doing this.  It is clear that there is an investor demand for it.<\/p>  <p>  On further investment of capital for transport projects, we are at a point where capital investment is increasing by almost 24% compared to last year, which is an increase of &euro;1.4 billion.

We should not be saying that we cannot hypothecate.  Green bonds do hypothecate: they have to go towards sustainable investments.

We can provide the counter parties with specific projects.<\/p>  <p>  I was on \"Prime Time\" the other night with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae to discuss retrofitting.  I mentioned that, on private homes alone, we are probably looking at a &euro;50 billion investment to get rid of fossil fuel heating systems.  We have to go further with our public buildings and our social housing.  It will require a massive, multi-billion euro investment.  The savings from the reduction in fuel costs can help to cover it if a long-term loan is required.  That type of hypothecation is the type of investment the market wants to invest in because it provides a future income stream.  It is similar in forestry.  We have to move towards a massive level of afforestation and continuous cover forestry.  The difficulty is that forestry is a 50 year, 80 year or 100 year project.  However, an income stream can be derived from the thinnings as the forest grows.  That has a real value, and the market can put a price on it, which provides it with confidence.  If there is confidence around those big capital, long-term projects then low-cost funding can be provided.  The Minister has to hypothecate to make that happen.

We can then explain to investors how their money is being used, including in areas such as clean transport and environmental projects.  My only area of difference with the Deputy Eamon Ryan on this issue is that I believe we should be very careful about saying that we are going to issue a bond to fund individual projects, because we have already seen and are well aware of the challenges that can arise when the funding of very specific projects is mooted and the delays that can happen on those projects as a result.  What the NTMA and the Government have done is more sensible.  We have laid out broad indicators of the kinds of projects we would like a green bond to fund without being specific about the projects themselves.  When we go to issue another green bond in the future we will have to show we have made this work, which of course is a different form of market discipline.

I repeat to the Deputy what I have said on previous occasions here and in other fora; if Europe takes it own path on this issue there will be consequences and I am concerned that Ireland will be at the fore of experiencing those consequences.

There has been extensive engagement from my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with this organisation since 2015.  Following analysis of its two proposals and meetings with the organisation in question, both Departments stated in writing that the second of the proposed models, the establishment of an SPV by credit unions, was the most suitable.  In July 2016, Rebuilding Ireland separately committed to establishing an innovation fund to support the development of innovative financial models.  It has been repeatedly clarified both in writing and indeed in answers to parliamentary questions that this commitment was not to establish a State-owned SPV, but rather to provide funding to help develop a sector-led approved housing body SPV.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of supporting credit unions in the provision of funding for social housing, the role of the Government and the Central Bank is to ensure there are is an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework.

Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal fuel trade include the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls and reporting requirements and a rigorous programme of enforcement action.  In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation from April 2015.

I know the Minister is examining this but we need to move to a situation where it is made absolutely clear to these producers that they will not get a cent more of public money unless they comply with the law.

I caught the end of the Minister for Finance's interaction with Deputy Burton.  Small businesses, farms, marts and festivals are being hammered by increasing insurance costs, particularly business insurance costs.  I do not know if the T&aacute;naiste heard it but I would encourage him to listen to Tuesday's edition of \"Today With Sean O'Rourke\" over the weekend.  That edition focused on play centres in particular and the hit they are taking.  One case in Navan involves a lady called Linda Murray who runs a centre employing 12 people that hosted 20,000 children last year.  Her costs have gone from &euro;2,000 in 2012 to &euro;16,000 in 2018 without a claim.  She is being advised that she cannot get a quote in 2019.  The insurance companies in this sector are beginning pull plant because Ireland is seen as such an outlier by the insurance industry.  If she was operating in the UK, she would get a quote - one that would be much lower.  We are talking about 12 jobs in a business that has been operating for seven years, involving very hard work, and that has a very high reputation.  Some 20,000 children in Navan being completely discommoded.  Similarly, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine are being told about marts throughout the country having to close.  Community events such as street festivals are affected.  Some 75 community festivals alone have shut down in the past few years because of increased insurance costs.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile nothing is happening.  Yes, there have been reductions in the cost of motor insurance because motor insurance is trackable and accessible but when it comes to this kind of insurance, there is a mystery behind it.  Business owners cannot see why their costs are increasing and what kind of claims are being settled.  Meanwhile the Government, once again, has its head in the sand.  On \"Today with Sean O'Rourke\" the other day, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, acknowledged that the level of claims in this country was the problem but this has been known for 19 or 20 months since it came forward in the report.  Yet it was only yesterday that the Minister for Justice and Equality wrote to the Chief Justice to ask him to do something about it.  In the meantime, 75 festivals, marts and small businesses throughout the country have gone to the wall.  What is the Government going to do about it?  Does it understand the seriousness of the situation facing small businesses?  Once and for all, can the Government stand up for small businesses against the might of the insurance industry?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400012#K00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1550145600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes on the day that is in it.

Indeed the problem of rising premiums in respect of motor insurance in particular was the main impetus for the establishment of the cost of insurance working group chaired by the Minister for Finance.  The working group is continuing to implement the 33 recommendations from the 2017 report on the cost of motor insurance and the 15 recommendations from the 2018 report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance, to which Deputy Calleary did not refer but which certainly exists.  Both of these primary reports contain action plans that set out agreed timelines for implementation as well as a commitment that the working group will prepare regular updates on its progress.

They will probably be a bit superfluous to requirements since there is already so much love in the Chamber between the two parties of Government.  In the wake of the CervicalCheck scandal, the buzz word about this place was \"confidence\".  However, the revelations of the past few days regarding cervical screening do nothing but undermine confidence in a system that can barely afford further controversy.  The T&aacute;naiste should not take my word for it.  The Irish Cancer Society has expressed worry about the delays.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, officials from the Department of Health said that no capacity analysis had been conducted regarding the ability of the CervicalCheck programme to carry out extra smear tests once the free tests had been announced by the Minister in April 2018.<\/p><p>This has resulted in a backlog of 78,000 tests and in some women waiting up to 27 weeks for their results.  Imagine that wait.  It is disgraceful.<\/p> <p> I happen to believe that offering free tests to women who wanted them, given the calamity we witnessed last year in respect of CervicalCheck, was the right thing to do but the Minister should have ensured that the capacity was there to deliver.  It is patently clear now he did not do that.  It is yet another shocking example of the shambles of a system this Minister presides over and it is further evidence that he is not up to the job of leading our health service.<\/p> <p> Given the scale of the CervicalCheck crisis, the very first thing the Minister should have done before offering free smear tests was to make it absolutely certain that the volume of additional tests could be dealt with within the medically indicated timeframe.  The position of the Department of Health is that it was impossible to quantify the uptake in respect of repeat smear tests.  This is nonsense.  It is a relatively recent scandal.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will recall the public outcry and the interest in this subject at the time, so it is little wonder that 90,000 women availed of the offer of a free repeat test.  We all now know about the Jade Goody effect, which, in 2009, gave rise to an increase in the number of women seeking tests in the wake of the death of that young woman.  It is no wonder that it happened here.  In fact, it is entirely predictable that it would happen here.  However, what we got instead was a soundbite when no work had been done in advance.<\/p> <p> We need to be able to trust the Minister for Health, the Department of Health and the HSE to respond appropriately and intelligently in a crisis.  What work was undertaken since these backlogs were reported as far back as August of last year?  Why has the backlog grown so continuously almost month on month?

That is what happened.  Undoubtedly, the response to that, as the Deputy has outlined, was significant as people sought reassurance, and that has put more pressure on the system.  The HSE and the Department of Health are responding to that by looking for increased lab capacity to be able to deal with that significant increase, which is a combination, by the way, not just of an increase as a result of out-of-cycle free smear tests on the advice of GPs but also an increased uptake of the test generally.  Therefore, the system has been put under a lot of extra strain.  It is not easy to put expanded or new contracts in place with the labs concerned.  What the HSE is now doing is prioritising the stabilising of CervicalCheck to get us back to where we should be, which is between four to six weeks of a wait as opposed to 24 to 26 weeks, which is not acceptable.  That needs to be and is the priority now.  The way in which we are responding to that is to look for and source increased capacity so we can get these waiting times down.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the switch to HPV testing, we are committed to this and international best practice would support that decision.  Some countries have already moved to HPV testing but Ireland will be one of the first movers.  We have committed in this year's budget to facilitating that transition and the preparation and scoping that is necessary to do that efficiently is under way.  We also have to factor in the need to prioritise the stabilisation of the existing screening process, which we are doing.  I am not in a position to give the Deputy an exact date.

How many more variations might the Government be expecting?  The procurement process should have delivered the correct form of contract but it did not happen.<\/p><p>The Government has used a fixed-price contract and for that one must have a well-defined scope of works or the claims will come.  We do not have a well-defined scope of work because, as I said last night, it is almost impossible with a complex engineering project such as a hospital, so the claims are coming, and we are only starting.  We needed a bespoke civil engineering remeasurement contract but we did not get it.

The contractor looks at what avenues he has to make extra money.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach passed a comment about the low balling of contracts.  He was a little on the naive side with his comment.  I would argue that right now for BAM it is like picking apples in an orchard and that is a big problem for the Government.  The legal firm is the adviser on how one procures and amends the tender documents and it has a duty to alarm its clients of the consequences of using standard documents such as those in the capital works management framework because they can only facilitate a fixed-price contract and they do not suit a job such as this one.  That gives unbelievable potential to the contractor to get extra money as it goes.  The legal firm is a construction specialist.  It is not true that it does not know.  It should know.  That is part of its job.  It did not have to rely on the capital works management framework, which the Department of Finance gives it.  It had other options.  I am seriously concerned with its performance and I think its professional indemnity should be considered.  This is not good enough and it will cost the Government too much money.

On Tuesday of last week, when asked if the head of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, alerted the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to the children's hospital's escalating cost overruns, the Taoiseach replied: &quot;If somebody is on a board, his or her fiduciary and legal responsibilities are to that board and the correct line of accountability is from the chairman of that board to the line Minister, not individual board members acting on their own part.&quot;  We now know that this statement was not true.  These constraints do not apply as the board in question is not a company.  It is a development board.

I will try to respond to them.  First, Mr. Paul Quinn is the Government chief procurement officer and head of the Office of Government Procurement.  Mr. Quinn was appointed in a personal capacity to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board for a five-year term in 2013 by the then Minister for Health, the now Senator James Reilly.  He was reappointed in 2018 by the current Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  Members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the board's own code of governance, have a duty to the board in the first instance, a responsibility to act collectively in decision-making and communication and an obligation to observe its confidentiality arrangements.  The Department of Health, as the accountable Department, established reporting and governance arrangements for the project through which the board provided regular updates to it on the project.  The Department of Health has already set out those governance arrangements in detail along with the timeline of when the board alerted it to the cost escalation and when the Department of Health subsequently communicated the new cost projections to the Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In other words, there were agreed codes of communication, both on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and also between that board and the accountable Department, that is, the Department of Health.  From my notes those codes and that process were followed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400015#N00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1550147400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach was right, then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400015#N00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1550147400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

It was quite apparent to anybody involved in the children's hospital that there were serious weaknesses in the controls.  That was apparent from early 2018.  Last night, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, told us the official in question was doing what he was supposed to be doing and was notifying the Department and the Minister.

There is a cohort of people who have gaps on which we do not have information and we have invited them by letter to apply either online or through the paper application to fill in those gaps.  That will enable us to increase their pension payments where possible.  That exercise is ongoing and I hope to be able to finalise it by the end of the first quarter, which was the scheduled timeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400018#Q01100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1550149200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>On Valentine's Day in 1981 many young people went out to enjoy a good night, but 48 did not come home.

Every day Deputies are contacted by upset constituents who are at the end of their tethers.  These people are trying to look for housing assistance payment, HAP, properties, having been given notices to quit because of sale or refurbishment of the properties in which they are living, they are living in substandard accommodation or they are sleeping in their cars or in tents.  There are mothers who are desperately upset with regard to how their children are reacting to the uncertainty relating to homeless accommodation.  There are also those who are trying to get deposits together for mortgages and individuals who require urgent housing adaptations.  The list is endless.  What these people experience is exhausting for them.  The Minister knows this as well as I do.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of individuals and families entering homelessness services are coming directly from the private rental sector, having been evicted.  Despite the Minister's comments earlier today, we do not even know how many new homes will be coming online and ready for occupation in each quarter.  We can only say to families with children who have been in hotel rooms for over two and a half years that they should be getting close to moving out or close to what Fingal County Council calls the \"offer zone\".  It is rare that families are in emergency accommodation for three years or more.  We also have no information on how long families have to spend in hubs, such as those in Greencastle Road and St. Lawrence Road in my constituency of Dublin Bay North.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how many more times and in how many more ways I and other Opposition Deputies - excluding those who are members of Fine Gael's coalition partner Fianna F&aacute;il of course - can provide options and solutions to the Government to address the housing and homelessness crisis.  I accept some builds are happening but in very small numbers and they are mainly for-profit units with few if any social housing units.  Fine Gael keeps trotting out the failing but glossy Rebuilding Ireland strategy, which places most of the so-called solutions in the broken private rental market.  A wide spectrum of Irish society is totally fed up with the tortuously slow response to the citizens and families enduring homelessness, those facing eviction and the tens of thousands on housing waiting lists.  The success of the Raise the Roof movement has shown us that almost every sector of Irish society wants and needs change.<\/p>  <p>  That is why our motion calls on the Fine Gael-led Government, propped up by Fianna F&aacute;il, to immediately declare a housing emergency and implement the necessary emergency measures to urgently address the crisis.  We believe a key element of those emergency measures should be an urgent return to direct-build by the local authorities and to support them, either individually or regionally, to develop and build out their own landbanks to deliver an adequate stream of social and affordable housing.  That direct-build programme in the four Dublin local authority areas should, for the reasons I have previously explained to the Minister regarding the problems that exist in Dublin city in particular, be managed by the Dublin Region Housing Executive.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion also calls on the Government to hold a referendum to place the right to housing and right to shelter in the Constitution on the same day as the local and European Parliament elections in May.  We should offer people the vote on the matter and see what they think.  The excuse the Minister outlines for not doing so in the Government amendment is pathetic.<\/p>  <p>  We also call on the Government to commit to rehousing families who have been in emergency homeless accommodation, including hubs, for 18 months or more by the end of the quarter 1 of this year and no later.  The Government should also commit to rehousing all other families experiencing homelessness by the end of quarter 2 and to limiting the use of hubs and emergency accommodation for families with children to three months maximum.  When the hub on Greencastle Road in Coolock started, the Salvation Army informed me that no family would be there for more than three months, but this is yet another promise that has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  We are also asking for increased supports to schools in areas with large populations of homeless families.  We come across that every week and we talk to children who are homeless.  We call on the Government to provide free counselling to all families and children experiencing homelessness should they wish to avail of the service; to increase the number of available emergency beds and single rooms in dry hostels; and, in particular, to extend the Housing First programme by doubling all targets in the Housing First National Implementation Plan 2018-2021.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister a question on this during Question Time.  During the week of 24 to 30 December, Christmas time, according to the official statistics from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, 3,559 homeless children were in emergency accommodation managed by local authorities across the country.  It is shocking and shameful that on Christmas Day, these children woke up in overcrowded homeless accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  At the start of this year, in replies to parliamentary questions on the number of families in direct provision centres, the Minister advised that in 2016 there were 899 parents and 1,219 children in direct provision centres.  I also asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to provide the numbers of parents and children in domestic violence refuges who were ready to move out of supported accommodation but who were awaiting appropriate accommodation.  TUSLA was unable to provide the numbers for 2017 and 2018 but did provide the figures for 2015 and 2016.  The latter showed that there were 1,736 adults and 2,463 dependent children in refuges in 2015 and 1,520 adults and 2,170 dependent children in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the Tusla figures, we can assume that there are at least around 2,000 children in domestic violence refuges and with almost 4,000 in official homeless figures and another 1,600 in direct provision centres, the number of homeless children on the watch of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is at least 8,000, an unbelievable statistic.<\/p>  <p>  The most frustrating aspect for Deputies on this side of the House is that we cannot trust the figures the Minister has given us in the past on the number of new homes built.  Last June he revealed that the Government was overestimating new build figures between 2011 and 2017 by over 30,000.  He claimed that approximately 85,000 homes were built, whereas the CSO figure put the number at 53,500.<\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis, of course, is most acute in the Dublin City Council region, the local authority area in which most of my constituency lies.  Housing output has been miserable in recent years.  Astonishingly, in the Dublin City Council area, direct social housing output in 2019 is expected to be lower than in 2018.  The February report of the Dublin City Council housing manager shows that in 2019, only 187 homes are expected to be built directly by Dublin City Council compared with 247 in 2018.  Only 170 units are to be leased or acquired in 2019 and voids restored will also fall.  In total, Dublin City Council housing output will only increase from 5,565 units in 2018 to 5,957 units in 2019, but 3,000 of those, of course, are HAP tenancies. <\/p>  <p>  Part of the constituency I represent is located in Fingal.  Fingal County Council is great at sending around press releases but its output from 2015 to 2017 has also been very disappointing.  The CEO&rsquo;s housing report on 11 February shows that only 416 social housing units were delivered in 2018, comprising Fingal direct build, approved housing bodies, Part V and voids.  Once again, the vast majority of what the Fingal County Council housing manager likes to call \"housing solutions\" - 1,243 units out of 1,916 social housing units - were simply HAP and RAS tenancies.  Everything is planned for the early 2020s and so on. <\/p>  <p>  The constant backdrop to the suffering of families and individuals on homelessness and housing lists, of course, is the ruthless Irish property market.<\/p><p>Almost all the families I have met going into homelessness were evicted by landlords and their agents.  The 2018 quarter four <i>daft.ie<\/i>rental price report again shows the remorseless determination by landlords and estate agents to maximise housing market profits and the inefficacy of the Government's so-called rent caps.  As the Minister knows, the sponsors of this motion all voted in this House for a three year rent freeze.  Dublin rents rose by almost 9% in 2018 and now are almost 40% above the pre-crash peak.  As my old economics teacher and the former Fine Gael Taoiseach, Mr. Garrett Fitzgerald, used to say, the rate of increase is falling but while the rate may be falling, it is still at 10%.  Galway rents rose by 13% in the same period, Cork rents rose by 11% and while rents in Limerick and Waterford were 16% and 16.7%, respectively, higher.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are in thrall, as always, to the property market sector and the country&rsquo;s landlords.  They have steadfastly refused to impose a statutory rent freeze, which is now needed urgently.<br\/><br\/>In December 2018, myself and my Independent colleagues submitted this motion which notes the constant and relentless increase in the homeless figures, except for small reductions in recent months, thanks in part to the recategorisation of some people by the Department.  We are asking that action would be taken for the children and families living in unsuitable, overcrowded accommodation, some of whom are engaging in couch surfing and other measures in an attempt to keep a roof over their heads.  The majority of the public believes that housing is a human right which should be enshrined in the Constitution.  Some people would argue that it is anterior to positive law and is a natural right that does not have to be explicitly referenced in the Constitution but I disagree.  We need to specify that right in our Constitution.  There are umpteen reports from civil society groups on how damaging homelessness is to children.  These reports detail how children's growth and nutrition is adversely affected, as well as their mental health and yet, this Government has sat back and allowed child homelessness to constantly climb.  The time for Fine Gael spin has long passed.  We need emergency action to address homelessness along the lines of the motion before us today.  I urge the Minister to act before it is too late and before he is removed from office in a general election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400023#Z00600","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550152200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Broughan for tabling this Private Member's motion on homelessness.  This motion was to be moved last December but was postponed, by agreement, to allow for other business.  It is certainly as relevant, if not more so, today.  Homelessness permeates our society and the figures for the number of homeless children referred to by Deputy Broughan are stark.  It must be extremely embarrassing for the Government, as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the First D&aacute;il, to see Army veterans using tricolour themed sleeping bags, now dubbed \"sleeping flags\", to highlight the issue of homelessness among ex-service personnel.  This is part of a campaign to raise funds for the services provided by the Organisation of National Ex-servicemen, ONE.  That organisation is dependent on public charity to continue its work.  Mr. Ollie O'Connor of ONE says that hundreds of Army veterans have ended up homeless.  The organisation has helped more than 900 homeless ex-Army personnel since it opened up its first hostel.  Last night when I was leaving Leinster House at around 10.55 p.m., there was a gentleman asleep outside the gates.  I did not wake him last night but spoke to him this morning.  His name is James Mee and he has completed almost 30 years service at Monaghan Army barracks.  He has done a tour of the Lebanon but was sleeping outside Leinster House last night to highlight the fact that some of his former colleagues are homeless and are sleeping on our streets.  The cost of running ONE's Br&uacute; na BhFiann hostel in 2017 was &euro;839,000, of which &euro;44,000 came from the Department of Justice and Equality and a further &euro;183,000 from the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive.  The remaining &euro;600,000 came from fundraising, which is disgraceful.  This must be addressed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p>  <p>  No doubt the Minister will bombard us with statistics and claim that progress is being made.  I will concede that some progress is, at last, being made.  Last year 18,000 new housing units were built, mainly in Dublin, where new units rose by one third.  However, this is still way below the generally accepted requirement of 30,000 units per year.  There is also a big question as to how many of these new builds in the private sector are affordable for people on average incomes.  The housing investment programme is predicting 6,200 public housing units this year, which is almost double the figure for 2018 but again, this is well short of the 10,000 units that are required per year.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday at the homelessness summit the Minister referred to 8,400 units comprising new builds, leases, voids, acquisitions, HAP and RAS.  How many of these units were built by local authorities and housing associations?  In 2017, the Minister spoke about 7,000 units in these categories but we found out later that of that total, only 394 units were local authority builds.  Apparently a special purpose vehicle, SPV, will be established this quarter to enable credit unions to invest in approved housing bodies, AHBs but credit unions expressed a desire to use a portion of their reserve funds in this way a very long time ago.  Again, it is a question of too little and too slow.  <\/p>  <p>  As the homelessness crisis carries on, it is doing untold damage to homeless children and young adults.  Behind all the statistics are real people who are negatively affected by this crisis.  The latest scientific and medical evidence suggests that good nutrition, play and a feeling of security are crucial to the development of children's brains and motor skills.  The lack of these crucial elements in their formative years can physically impair children's brain development and can have long lasting if not life-long effects.  Children in temporary accommodation without cooking facilities or areas for playing and mixing with others are deprived of the aforementioned crucial elements.  The same is true of the effects of homelessness on young adults.  The rate of homelessness among young adults has doubled in the last four years.  Young adults are at a crucial point in their emotional, cognitive and social development, transitioning from adolescence to adulthood.  Again, difficult experiences at this stage can have life-long consequences.  It is much more difficult for this group to exit homelessness because they are not entitled to public housing and they cannot afford the astronomical rents being charged in the private sector.  This is particularly true for those in receipt of a social welfare payment, often the half-rate jobseeker's allowance.  A group called the Irish Coalition to End Youth Homelessness held a briefing last week in Buswells Hotel.  The group argued strongly for the introduction of a Housing First programme for young adults and I urge the Minister to consider that.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must respond to the points made in the Private Member's motion before us.  It must declare a housing emergency and hold a referendum on the right to housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400024#AA00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1550152200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I wish to acknowledge the work of Deputy Broughan and his staff in preparing this Private Member's motion.  We have been consumed by health issues in recent weeks and I welcome the fact that we are being reminded again today of the importance of housing and homelessness.  I took part in two debates in the House last week.  One was on the child and adolescent mental health Service, CAMHS, and the other was on a report on childhood obesity, both of which are relevant to today's debate, such is the effect of homelessness on children.  Being homeless and in inappropriate accommodation, whether that is a hotel, bed and breakfast accommodation or moving from one relative to another, has a devastating effect on the physical and mental health of adults but it is particularly hard on children.  We know of the delays in accessing CAMHS and it is schools and youth projects that are picking up the pieces for these children.  Great work is being done in school completion programmes, by home school liaison officers and youth projects but they need more support and resources to continue their work.  It is very difficult for families living in temporary or unsuitable accommodation to cook and eat healthily.  They are overly reliant on take-away and fast food, which contributes significantly to childhood obesity.<\/p>  <p>  Last night RT&Eacute; broadcast a very interesting report on homelessness in Dublin.  The figures were very stark, particularly the really significant increases in homelessness in the last few years.  I acknowledge that people are moving out of homelessness and I know of many individuals and families who have finally found a home.  However, no sooner does that happen than others are becoming homeless and going onto the housing list because of unscrupulous landlords who are evicting them in favour of those who can and will pay higher rents.  A ban on rent increases should be introduced overnight with no lead-in period because we are in a housing emergency.  Those landlords who are ethical and moral and who have certain standards would not have a problem with that.  To make a real difference, evictions must cease except in very extreme circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the complex needs of rough sleepers but they are getting lost in the current housing crisis.  The mortality rates for those sleeping rough are shocking.  A study conducted a number of years ago found that the average life expectancy for men sleeping rough was 44 years while for women, it was 38 years.  Life expectancy for the general population is almost double that.  Such is the extent of the housing crisis that rough sleepers are falling down the priority list.  Other groups that are getting lost include Travellers, people in addiction and those in recovery from addiction.  The latter group in particular are being put into inappropriate accommodation which is making their continued recovery very difficult.  Single people are also being left behind.  We are all aware of the shortage of one-bedroom units.  <\/p><p>Equally, those who were on the housings lists prior to the housing crisis are being pushed further down the lists because of it.  The Minister's amendment refers to the availability of &euro;6 billion under Rebuilding Ireland to support the delivery of 50,000 new social housing homes and 87,000 other housing supports over the six years from 2016 to 2021.  I heard the Minister say on radio this morning that 8,400 social units were provided in 2018, either built, repaired or made available.  Any increase is welcome.  How does the Minister propose to make up the balance in the remaining two years?  There is need for a detailed plan in that regard.<\/p> <p> Social mix was referred to.  I hope we will not repeat the mistakes of the past of putting all social housing in one block and, as I have witnessed, different treatment of those residents by the management companies.  My bugbear is student accommodation.  We supported it on the false premise that it would have an impact on the housing emergency.  As students live in this accommodation for only eight to nine of the year it is a lucrative profit-making enterprise for the remaining months of the year.  I have been in student accommodation.  It is very good, with 24-hour management on site.  Why is it the owners of this accommodation were not required to provide, say, 10% of this accommodation for suitable people?  The urgency and speed with which student accommodation is being provided, which is very good quality accommodation, is not replicated in the provision of social housing.<\/p> <p> In regard to the docklands, of the 1,178 apartments being built in this area only 26 will be social homes.  There are concerns that there will be little or no social housing within the strategic development zone, SDZ, with social housing being located well away from the docklands area.  Existing communities are concerned about the pressure to increase building heights.  While agreed heights are already in place and some developers have adhered to them, there is increasing pressure to raise them further.  This will have a devastating affect on the communities living in this area. <\/p> <p> I acknowledge that the Minister has a difficult Ministry and that the root of the problem took hold before he took office in it but it is heartbreaking to hear the realities of life for those who are homeless.  It is equally disturbing to still see derelict sites and local authority housing voids.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400024#AA00300","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550152800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;acknowledges that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government recognised the urgency of the housing crisis over two years ago and introduced the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, providing a comprehensive framework for addressing the range of complex issues needing to be addressed across the housing sector;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is underpinned by over &euro;6 billion in funding to support the delivery of 50,000 new social housing homes and 87,000 other housing supports over the six years 2016 to 2021;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; very significant progress has been made from 2016 to the end of 2018, in partnership with local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and a range of other delivery partners, with over 72,000 individuals and families having their housing needs met during those three years, over 27,000 of which were supported in 2018 alone, and a further 27,300 households are expected to be supported this year, and this will bring to almost 100,000 the total number of households who will have been assisted under Rebuilding Ireland by the end of 2019;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22 per cent, from 91,600 households to 71,858, between 2016 and 2018;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; to date, Rebuilding Ireland has increased the active social housing stock by over 21,200 homes, with some 8,420 of these being delivered in 2018;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in 2018, over 18,000 new homes were built, a 25 per cent increase on the previous year and the highest number of newly built homes any year this decade, and in addition, more than 2,500 homes were brought out of long-term vacancy, with almost 800 dwellings in unfinished housing developments completed, meaning the number of new homes available for use increased by almost 21,500 in 2018, which does not include the 3,742 bed spaces completed in the student sector in 2018;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government is committed to supporting those single persons, families and their dependents who are experiencing homelessness, and Budget 2019 reflects this commitment, with an increase of 25 per cent in the current spending budget for the provision of homeless services (bringing the total to &euro;146 million for this year);<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the most recent published statistics show there were 9,753 persons in emergency accommodation in the month of December 2018, comprised of 6,194 adults and 3,559 associated dependants, and this represents a reduction of 215 people nationally on the numbers recorded in November;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in December 2018, there were 111 fewer families and 252 fewer dependants in emergency accommodation than was the case in November, and that for the fifth consecutive month there was a reduction recorded in the number of families presenting to homeless services in the Dublin region;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; 111 families exited emergency accommodation into new homes in Dublin in December 2018, while 72 per cent of families in emergency accommodation in the Dublin region at the end of December had been homeless for less than one year, and through service level agreements with service providers, local authorities are working towards ensuring that exits from homelessness are achieved within six months of entering emergency accommodation;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; while the most recent count of rough sleepers in the Dublin region showed that 156 individuals were recorded sleeping rough, which was an increase on the numbers recorded in March 2018, there was a decrease of 28 on the number of persons recorded as sleeping rough during the equivalent winter count in 2017;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the number of beds in use for single adults has risen from 2,000 beds at the end of 2017 to 2,300 beds in the Dublin region at the end of 2018, and all of these beds are supported temporary accommodation where single individuals and couples receive the accommodation and health supports that they need, with those presenting as homeless being matched to the best available accommodation, according to their needs, and emergency accommodation capacity fluctuates and is dictated by demand, with extra contingency beds being put in place during periods of adverse weather;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; increased outreach and prevention measures are working and will continue to be supported by the Government, including through the Homeless Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Placefinder Service, and 19 HAP Placefinders are now in place and to the end of quarter 3, 2018, in excess of 5,300 households have been supported through Homeless HAP nationally, 4,350 of whom were in the Dublin region;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government will continue to provide more suitable temporary accommodation to homeless families, increasing the number of family hubs to 26 at the end of 2018, with a total capacity for over 600 families, and with further hubs spaces to be added in 2019, as hubs provide a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, with the capacity to provide appropriate play-space, cooking and laundry facilities, communal recreation space, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the most recently available performance reports show 3,752 adults exiting homelessness into independent tenancies in the nine-month period between January and September 2018, and this represents an increase of 431 (13 per cent) on the 3,321 exits recorded over the same period in 2017;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; an error was discovered in 2018, whereby households who were not in emergency accommodation had been counted in the emergency accommodation numbers, and this error was rectified and reports on the matter were published;<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; extensive supports are also provided to families experiencing homelessness by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, and supports include:&mdash; a special provision under the existing Community Childcare Subvention Programme of free childcare for children from homeless families;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Tusla&rsquo;s School Completion Programme, which places an emphasis on children from homeless families;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Home School Community Liaison Scheme co-ordinators proactively engaging with parents from homeless families to provide supports and assistance where required; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; children in homeless accommodation being prioritised within the School Completion Programme for services such as breakfast and homework clubs; and<\/blockquote><p>further acknowledges that:<\/p><blockquote>&mdash; Housing First is delivering permanent housing solutions for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation, and by the end of 2018, the Dublin Region Housing First Service had created Housing First tenancies for 243 unique individuals, of whom 86 per cent have successfully retained their homes, and the Housing First National Implementation Plan 2018-2021 contains targets for each local authority, with an overall national target of an additional 663 tenancies to be delivered by 2021;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a high-level Homelessness Inter-Agency Group has been established, with representation from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills, local authorities, Tusla and the Health Service Executive, and a report from this Group was submitted to Cabinet in June 2018, and a range of recommendations are now being implemented, including better co-ordination of responses, particularly in the areas of health, justice and family homelessness;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the provision of accommodation to those in the international protection process and the provision of domestic violence refuges, and reporting on progress in these areas, will continue to be prioritised by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs\/Tusla, respectively; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution recommended that the State should progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to housing, subject to maximum available resources, by inserting such a right into the Constitution of Ireland, and the Convention&rsquo;s recommendation raises substantial questions, including for example, the suitability or otherwise of the Constitution of Ireland as a vehicle for providing for detailed rights in this area, the possible cost, and the fact that there is already power by legislation to confer rights and determine expenditure via primary and secondary legislation and an elected and accountable Government and Oireachtas, and for these reasons the issue of the right to housing was referred, for further consideration, to the appropriate Oireachtas Committee, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, in October 2017.<\/blockquote><p>I thank the Deputies for tabling this motion and for facilitating the time change to enable it to take place.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to stay for the full debate as I only got notice that we were taking it today and arrangements had already been made that I cannot change.  I accept the point that regardless of what else is happening in public life we need to be constantly debating this issue in this House because it is so important.  I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that it is heartbreaking to hear the very difficult stories of not only people who are in emergency accommodation but people in housing insecurity, people experiencing difficulty paying the rent or trying to save for a mortgage and the many others who are suffering because we stopped building houses when the economy crashed and for years before that we were not properly building social housing in a sustainable way.  A combination of all these factors, including the increase in demand from people returning home and so on, has put huge demand on the housing system throughout the country.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland is about rebuilding our housing sector in a sustainable way over time.  I have never said that this could be done in one, two or three years.  There are three years remaining in Rebuilding Ireland as a plan.  We have from 2016 to 2021, which is the life span of the plan, to make the corrections that we need to make and to do so in a sustainable way.  By sustainable I mean a social mix and getting it right and not building massive social housing estates.<\/p><p>Sustainability also means higher densities in places such as Dublin and other cities and urban centres where there is already infrastructure and people want to live.  Sustainability also means building really good homes.  I will not put people into student accommodation for 20 or 30 years.  That accommodation is brilliant for students for nine months.  It takes the pressure off the housing system because it means students are not renting a house in, say, Rathmines, Aungier Street, and so on.  The houses we build have to be of the best possible standard because they have to stand the test of time.  Also these houses will be people's homes, so they will have to be very good.  We are taking all these actions over time.<\/p><p>We are roughly half way through Rebuilding Ireland so it is a good time to take stock in terms of where we are going.  In terms of each of the challenges that we have or that people face in housing in Ireland today, the focus has to be on the root challenge of increasing supply.  There is no point talking about other actions because that is just tinkering.  We have to ensure that supply is increased, and in addition to that, we do the other things that we need to do to protect people who are in difficulty.  The information we have from the CSO is important.  Everybody knew we were using ESB connection data in regard to housing data.  It was not a hidden fact.  Rather, it was a stated fact that this was the best way to get an idea of the increase in supply.  When I took up this Ministry I asked that people try to get an actual figure so that we could really measure what was going on.  We did that work with the CSO and we now have those figures.  The latest information for 2018 is really encouraging.  There were 18,000 new builds last year, which is a 25% increase on the previous year.  In addition, 2,500 vacant homes were returned to the housing stock.  A further almost 800 homes were also brought back into use.  These were houses in ghost estates, which shows that the legacy of the crash is still with us.  Also, approximately 3,400 student bed spaces were provided.  I have already mentioned why student accommodation is important.<\/p><p>We also have important information today about house price inflation.  It is roughly half what it was in 2017 or 2018.  We know that this is linked to the increase in supply.  House prices are coming down and the rents are reducing but not everywhere.  The Deputies will be aware that I have rent legislation coming through the House because some of them have made positive contributions to it and put forward ideas on how the legislation can be improved on Committee Stage, which we will do.  We also have the figures from local authorities in terms of council housing.  The increase in the stock of social housing last year was significant, being in the thousands.  One in four of the new houses built last year was for council housing.  I do not know when we last did that but I am looking into it.  There are approximately 70,000  people on the housing list, who are our most vulnerable people and need our help.  There are also just under 10,000 people in emergency accommodation.  As I said, one in four new houses built last year was for council housing.  That is not a low target.  It is good, but we can do more.  I will give Deputies another percentage that might drive them crazy.  There was an 800% increase in social housing build over the year before Rebuilding Ireland.  Rebuilding Ireland is increasing supply across the economy, including in social housing.  This is positive news because these new homes help people out of emergency accommodation or overcrowded situations into new homes.  I have met the families who have experienced this.  For all the heartbreaking stories we hear, and there is still too much heartbreak out there, it is heart warming when one meets a family given the keys to their new home.  I have met some people who have just started their families and have moved from hospital into their new homes.  It is fantastic but we need to do so much more because there are so many people who are still in emergency accommodation or still cannot get their own home.<\/p><p>On the number of people in emergency accommodation, there was a decrease in December, which is welcome, but it could be seasonal.  In regard to families in emergency accommodation, we also had a number of exits in December.  These are families who exited into tenancies as opposed to into their own homes.  There was also a decrease in the number of presentations and a decrease in the number of people in hotels, which is also welcome.  Much more work needs to be done.  I met the local authorities yesterday and drilled this home to them again.  It was our fifth housing summit.  It is a good process in terms of finding out were the challenges are.  We need more hubs as a first response and we need delivery of more homes.  We also need to do more work on prevention.  Dublin City Council is in the process of hiring new officers to engage with people and help them out of emergency accommodation or to prevent them going into it.<\/p><p>I will not comment on the rent pressure zones because we will have another opportunity to talk about them but I would like to comment briefly on HAP.  There are roughly 900,000 people in the country renting.  Renting is a safe, secure place for the vast majority of people.  It does not work for some and that is why we have, and continue to, put in place extra supports.  We did a lot of homeless HAP last year which really helped people and prevented them ending up in emergency accommodation.  The housing assistance payment allows people to have flexibility and choice in where they live.  It allows them to continue working and earn more money without affecting their housing entitlement and it also allows us to deliver social mix where there previously was no social mix planned in advance.  It has positives to it and that must be recognised.  We are not planning to put all our weight on the private sector to deliver social housing supports.  We are rebalancing.  The HAP supports for 2018 versus 2017 were static.  The increased delivery came through the increase in stock.  This year, we will do less through new HAP than we did last year.  Moving forward with each year we rebalance such that in 2021, we will have more people being supported into new social housing homes than being supported into HAP tenancies.  We will continue on from there.  This is the trajectory we are on.<\/p><p>I will now address a couple of issues in the motion.  On the recategorisation issue, which comes up time and again, nobody was removed from the homeless figures.  What happened was that people who were not in emergency accommodation were counted by local authorities as being in emergency accommodation.  This was corrected.  I have been transparent around this issue.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government accepted that this mistake was made.  As I said, it has been corrected.<\/p><p>The important thing here is not being obsessed with the numbers.  It is about how we help the people who are behind the numbers.  That is the one thing about this debate that really disappoints me.  People are focusing on numbers when they should be focusing on the people behind the numbers and how we help those people out of emergency accommodation and into homes.  That is exactly what we are trying to in everything we do.  <\/p> <p> The Deputy has said that we should declare an emergency.  I am not quite sure what new powers we would take in declaring an emergency or how we would use them.  I have looked to see what I could do if I declared an emergency.  I cannot get around procurement law and I am bit reluctant to go further with regard to planning changes because if we cut standards or regulations too much, we will have situations like Priory Hall in the future.  The Deputy should please tell me what emergency powers he would take, how he would do something with a quick change in law that we have not been able to do over the past number of years and what such a law would look like because we have looked at this.  <\/p> <p> The right to housing has been discussed.  It is one of a number of socioeconomic rights that are being discussed by the relevant committee in the House.  If we move too quickly to a referendum on something, we risk losing it.  We have seen how a proper process has helped us win very important referenda in our recent history.  The introduction of a constitutional or legal change regarding the right to housing in other countries has not ended homelessness and the need for emergency accommodation so we must be clear on this.  I am not saying I am against having a referendum or the idea of it.  I am saying that there is work to be done.  While that deliberative work is being done, we will do physical work in terms of building new homes.  <\/p> <p> Regarding the time spent in emergency accommodation, 72% of families in emergency accommodation in Dublin are there for less than one year.  The average length of time in a hub is less than six months.  Again, when one meets the families who have gone from a hotel to a hub to a home, one can see and understand the benefit of the trajectory.  They should never have been in a hotel.  Families who go straight into a hub will get into a social housing home far more quickly as a result, which is why we need more hubs as a first and temporary response.  <\/p> <p> The number of beds for individuals is increasing and we have more coming on stream.  Recently, there was a meeting of the Ministers over the interagency group so it involved the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Justice and Equality, Health along with myself and others.  Next week, the Taoiseach will bring a memorandum to Cabinet on additional supports we are bringing in for people in emergency accommodation, some of whom are trapped there because we do not know their rights or status.  Some of them have long-term health needs that are not being met because they are not in the right accommodation.  All these new supports will help improve that.  <\/p> <p> Housing First is working really well with an 88% to 92% retention rate, with people not falling back into homelessness.  We have a national director, a national plan and ambitious targets on which we will build but we must put in the resources first.  We must build it and get it right and not do it in the wrong way or else people will start to change their minds around Housing First.  Again, we are trying to bring a number of different bodies involved in emergency accommodation around to this new way of thinking.  Most have come that way but we need to do it in a stepped way to get it really right.  Supply is key to all our challenges.  The recent numbers we are seeing with regard to supply are really positive but we will not stop here.  The number will increase again in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.  We will keep on going until we get this done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400025#BB00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550153400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I thank Deputy Broughan, a former teacher of mine, for tabling this motion.  It is disappointing that nearly three years after the election of the 32nd D&aacute;il, an issue that dominated the very beginning of that D&aacute;il, housing and homelessness, is as severe and prominent today as it was three years ago.  While Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the principles of the motion before us today, I acknowledge that there is no one simple solution to this.  The motion specifically calls for an emergency to be declared and emergency actions to be taken.  They must be taken in tandem with long-term structural changes that are needed in terms of the provision of significant additional housing.  The motion acknowledges the fact that we still have people who are homeless.  According to the latest homeless figures we were quoting, almost 10,000 people are homeless, of whom more than 3,500 are children.  As public representatives, we all know the challenging lives those families are living, particularly if they have children, because we meet them in our constituency offices.  Whether it involves trying to access cooking facilities in hotels or being driven to different areas to try to get to schools, their lives are hell at the moment.  This figure has consistently stayed in or around the same number for a long time.  It is in that context that we need to look at some of the emergency measures.<\/p>  <p>  I would allude also to the fact that the figure for rough sleepers in recent times is quite high.  I think the latest figure we got was 156.  I do not know where the count is but I am certainly seeing people sleeping rough in parts of Dublin where I never saw them before - on the canals and out on the M50, N4 and N7 in tents.  That is something I have never seen before and I do not know if those people are even included in that count.  I would have serious concerns about that.  <\/p>  <p>  The first action in Rebuilding Ireland was the rapid build programme, which is why emergency actions must be taken in parallel with structural changes.  The Minister committed to delivering 1,500 rapid build units by the end of 2018.  My understanding is that only a couple of hundred of those have been built.  Can the Minister imagine what would have happened if the 1,500 had been delivered in a timely fashion, as was anticipated and as was supported by Members on all sides of this House?  Think of the positive impact that would have had on the people who are now homeless because rapid build was, as was specifically stated in Rebuilding Ireland, aimed at addressing the immediate need of homelessness.  It has been allowed to slide and has not been addressed significantly.  <\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed when I drive around Dublin and see the number of vacant houses.  The repair and leasing scheme is not returning the type of figures hoped for.  I do not know the answer to it but I think that in times of emergency, we should know why properties around this city and its suburbs still remain vacant instead of being brought back into use.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about the number of new build social houses for 2018 and how about 18,000 new houses were built, of which 4,000 were social houses.  However, I have one particular concern.  One of the Deputies asked how many of those houses were local authority houses.  Only 2,022 houses were built by local authorities last year.  The reason I am concerned about it is that, traditionally, local authorities were the leaders in the provision of social housing yet in 2018, the total number of social houses built by local authorities was 2,022.  A total of 1,388 were provided by approved housing bodies while 840 were provided by Part V.  There needs to be a much clearer focus on the delivery of social houses through the local authority scheme.  From my conversations with people in the housing departments in local authorities, I believe they are still concerned about the process and the time it takes.  There is a piece of work to be done there.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about HAP.  He talked about giving people choice and how they can work and pick where they want to live.  At the moment, there is an over-reliance on HAP.  HAP is certainly a very suitable payment for a short-term situation but for somebody who wants to settle down in a particular town or community, who has young children and who would envisage staying in that community and their children going to the local primary school and progressing to the local secondary school, HAP does not afford them these opportunities.  The figures are in the programme but the problem with HAP, a problem the Minister needs to get to the bottom of, is that there is very significant churn in private rental accommodation.  Not many people stay five or ten years.  The people who are coming to our constituency offices who are homeless have all come through private rented accommodation.  I am not opposed to HAP but what I am concerned about is the over-reliance on HAP.  It is a short-term solution that does not provide the long-term accommodation it should.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise and appreciate that a Bill will come before the House relating to private rented accommodation.  Regarding a rent register, I spoke to Deputy &Oacute; Broin about a particular case where property was vacated, re-advertised and re-let and the rent went up significantly.  It is very important that legislation on a rent register is introduced.  Many people in private rented accommodation are in a vulnerable situation.  There is such a scarcity of property that they are afraid to complain.  Property inspections need to be ramped up.  I know the Minister will say there has been an increase year on year.  The target is one in four properties being inspected by 2021.  That programme should be accelerated.<\/p>  <p>  In the amendment to the motion, I see that the Minister noted \"the level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22 per cent, from 91,600 households to 71,858, between 2016 and 2018.\"<\/p><p>That may be statistically correct but the problem is I meet a significant number of people who do not qualify for social housing and have no prospect of buying a house of their own, so they are caught in limbo.  It is about time the income thresholds for social housing, particularly in Dublin where the cost of accommodation is so expensive, were reviewed.  This is important.  As I said, I meet a significant number of people who do not qualify for social housing but who do not have a hope in hell of qualifying for a mortgage to buy anything in the greater Dublin area.<\/p> <p> The issue of affordable housing needs to be addressed.  All of the Dublin Deputies, although I cannot speak for those in the rest of the country, will know of many cases where two people in a household are working but have no chance of buying a house in Dublin in a community where they may have lived all of their lives.  We need to look to introducing schemes in this regard.  While the Minister may argue funding is available for infrastructure, which will reduce the cost of housing, it is not significant enough.  There are significant developments under construction and to be constructed in the South Dublin County Council area but none of them offers meaningful affordable housing schemes, which means a cohort of people will be left behind.  Apart from the cost of the house being reduced, we need some type of savings scheme and recognition that the fact people are paying rent impacts on their ability to save a deposit.  All of those issues need to be considered.  There is certainly a group of people in this country who are working but who do not qualify for social housing.  If we do not change and give them an opportunity to buy their own home, they will never have that opportunity.  In addition, in the absence of a cost rental model, their rent will go up significantly over their lifetime.<\/p> <p> There is much comment on the right to housing from the point of view of whether a constitutional or legislative change should be made, and the Minister said this is being considered.  Three years ago, the Committee on Housing and Homelessness made a recommendation that an Oireachtas committee should address this issue as a matter of priority.  It is not just some abstract or meaningless right that would be nice to have in the Constitution; it would be a counterbalance to existing property rights.  I recall that at one of the sessions of the committee we discussed the purpose of the vacant sites levy.  We were informed that, due to the advice of the Attorney General, the levy could only be introduced at a date in the future and at a certain rate.  The reason given was that there was protection of property rights in the Constitution but there was no counterbalance in terms of a right to housing.  That is a tangible example of why a right to housing in the Constitution would be beneficial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400026#CC00200","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550154000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Over several previous contributions on homelessness in our Republic, I have pleaded with this Fine Gael Government to declare homelessness to be a national emergency and I have asked that it do this now.  Our homelessness national emergency needs a whole-of-Government response, with monthly targets and delivery reports.  We must declare today that the common good of the people dictates that the Government must ensure a minimum standard of housing for all of our people.<\/p>  <p>  That common good is the primary responsibility of Government.  If policies are not working, then they need to be changed or dumped immediately.  There are almost 10,000 homeless human beings in Ireland today who need to see delivery on homes.  There are also the uncounted thousands known as Ireland's hidden homeless, those who are still living with parents or in overcrowded accommodation because the Government in 2019 cannot ensure an adequate supply of homes.  Just as frightening is the fact that hard-working people, including public servants such as nurses and garda&iacute;, and young men and women working in industry - will never afford to own their own home in Fine Gael's so-called republic of opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The fact remains that our Republic and our political system of government, from Cabinet to Department to Parliament to local authority, is failing to ensure there are enough homes for our citizens.  We have been elected to represent the common good and to ensure it is vindicated, and we should not be afraid to call out the truth.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il have not played, and will not play, politics with homelessness and housing.  Looking for ministerial heads, looking for an irresponsible and premature general election, will not take a single family out of homelessness.  Outrage politics will not build a single home.  The politics of continuous protest will not generate the practical solutions that can be put in place to radically increase the availability of affordable homes for all Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be honest when it comes to our homelessness crisis.  There are almost 10,000 homeless people in Ireland today, not including the hidden homeless, because there are not enough homes for our people.  We need to build, purchase and acquire sufficient housing units to radically increase the supply of homes.  Homes can only be built on appropriately zoned lands.  Builders in the construction industry build these homes and have a duty of quality of provision.  Planners ensure that homes are appropriate to the area in which they are being built and they have a duty to gear up to this crisis.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la decides appeals and must do so quickly and with a view to the scale of Ireland's homelessness crisis.  Politicians who come into the House to complain about homelessness but then object to the building of homes need to reflect on the hypocrisy shown.  Irish Water needs to ensure that it is not a block to the development of housing.<\/p>  <p>  Too many delays are beginning to appear in the system.  The Government must ensure there are policies to direct financial supports, end bureaucratic delays and drive the sense of urgent action that the crisis requires.  Throughout our recent negotiations with the Government on the latest budget and on the renewal of the confidence and supply agreement, we in Fianna F&aacute;il ensured delivery on housing is the priority to be tackled this year.  Fianna F&aacute;il has secured ambitious but achievable targets in the provision of homes, which previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have delivered, often in far tougher economic times.<\/p>  <p>  The question must now be asked of all parties and none: what do they propose to do?  On this, Fianna F&aacute;il has brought forward many solutions.  Through the confidence and supply agreement we increased social housing funding.  The overall capital budget for housing has increased from &euro;1.065 billion in 2018 to &euro;1.34 billion in 2019, a 25% increase, and this includes social housing and homeless capital funding.  Since Fianna F&aacute;il entered into the confidence and supply arrangement, we have forced the housing capital budget to increase from &euro;430 million in budget 2016 to &euro;1.34 billion today, a &euro;900 million or more than 300% increase.  We have proposed a new affordable housing scheme.  Only &euro;20 million was allocated to an affordable housing scheme in 2018, with no units delivered or regulations even signed off.  Fianna F&aacute;il has established a revamped scheme worth more than &euro;100 million per annum over the next three years, which will deliver some 7,500 units at an average price of &euro;200,000 for ordinary income workers.<\/p>  <p>  Our policies will keep landlords in the vital rental market with tax incentives to stabilise rents.  Landlords that sell up are removing units from the market and driving up rents, with 4,000 landlords leaving over the past 12 months.  We established a 100% mortgage interest relief measure to help keep landlords in the market and maintain supply in the short term while more homes are built.  Further measures to incentivise long-term leases are in development.  Delays in procurement and the four-step approval process for social housing are crippling delivery.  We tripled the discretion of local authorities to build homes without going through administrative hoops.  Local authorities can now build up to &euro;6 million or 30 homes through a fast-track process.<\/p>  <p>  Affordability of homes is key to addressing homelessness in Ireland.  Affordable housing was a key aim of Fianna F&aacute;il in budget 2019.  We actively support home ownership and aim to launch an ambitious new scheme that will provide subsidised homes on State-owned lands across the country.  There is a new &euro;100 million per annum affordable housing fund, an investment that will construct at least 6,000 homes by 2021 and it quadruples the original allocated money per year from &euro;25 million.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities must work with other agencies to identify where affordable homes should be built.  They will take out loans from Housing Finance Agency to build the units, with a further subsidy of between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000 per home directly from the Exchequer.  Homes are sold for approximately &euro;200,000 to households on incomes of &euro;50,000 annually for a single earner and &euro;75,000 for those with joint incomes who cannot afford to buy a home in their own local area.<\/p><p>The proceeds of the sales are used to build new homes and the process starts again.  Some 6,000 to 7,500 units could be built under the scheme by 2021.  Social housing funding has been ramped up by &euro;270 million.  Year on year, there is a &euro;270 million or 25% increase.<\/p> <p> Budget 2019 was not a landlord's budget.  A rental market needs landlords if it is to work.  The budget does, however, incentivise landlords to stay in the system.  Some 40,000 landlords left the system between 2012 and 2018, including 4,000 in the past 12 months.  We need to keep landlords in the system or else there will be fewer units available to rent and rents will rise as a result.  Mortgage interest relief is targeted at small landlords with two units or less to keep them in the system.  My personal view has always been that if it takes constitutional change for the Government to ensure that there are enough homes for people then that must not be avoided because of powerful vested interests.<\/p> <p> The common good has been a core founding principle of all republics since the idea of people-based government was invented by the ancient Greeks and Romans.  The State we celebrate this year, with 100 years since the First D&aacute;il, has been guided by the aspiration of being a republic for all our people.  The common good for Irish people in 2019 should be results and achievements in the context of ending homelessness and ensuring homes for all.  The people will eventually decide whether we, the elected Parliament, have been up to the work that is needed to end chronic homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400027#DD00200","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550154600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Buckley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400028#EE00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1550154600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Contrary to what the Minister stated, the Oireachtas committee did not under any circumstances accept that his removal of homeless adults and children from the figures relating to homelessness was acceptable.  In fact, at the Oireachtas committee hearing &ndash; Members can check the record &ndash; there was a clear disagreement.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive and independent academics who helped with the homeless report categorically said on the record that the adults and children who were removed at the request of the Minister were, at the time of their removal, homeless, without tenancies, without security of accommodation and accessing homeless services, something Brendan Kenny, the director of housing services for Dublin City Council had also confirmed.  The Minister is absolutely wrong and should consider correctly the record and misrepresenting the Oireachtas committee.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister also claimed that recent figures both from the CSO and his Department suggest that we are turning a corner, that supply is beginning to increase and that it is a sign that things are going to change.  The problem is that if one takes the figures that he is quoting and compare them against his own targets, the very opposite is the case.  Last week, the CSO released the total output figures for 2018.  They are good robust figures and I have no quibble with them whatsoever.  The indicate that 18,000 homes were constructed in 2018, up from 14,000 in 2017 and 9,000 in 2016.  That is positive, but what is the Rebuilding Ireland commitment?  It is to ensure that an average of 25,000 homes are produced every year in the period to 2021.  That means what the Government believes is necessary to tackle the crisis is an average of 25,000 units a year.  Halfway through Rebuilding Ireland, how far are we behind target?   The answer is that we are 43% behind target?   While I welcome the additional homes, for the Minister to somehow say this is unquestionable progress belies his own targets.<\/p>  <p>  When one looks at the social housing delivery figures that were announced late last night, the Government is claiming 27,000 social housing tenancies were created last year.  We know from the figures that only 6,861 real social houses, owned by approved housing bodies and local authorities, were delivered last year.  That is no my definition of real social housing, it is that of the National Economic and Social Council and the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  Of those, just over 4,000 were built and the real worry, which I share with Deputy Curran, is that only 2,000 of those were delivered by local authorities.  It is not that the other units were not welcome, but 31 local authorities should be delivering far more than 2,000 new builds a year.  Five approved housing bodies are delivering almost as many new builds as the local authorities and that makes absolutely no sense.<\/p>  <p>  The Department continues to wrongly count expensive casual re-lets as voids.  I think that practice should stop as it inflates the figures, albeit by only a small amount.  Probably the real scandal of the figures last night is 44% of the Traveller accommodation budget remains unspent.  This is the second year in a row that the Traveller community has been badly served by the Government.  That is the reason homelessness among Traveller is higher than in any other section of the population.  That is why tragedies happen such as we saw in Carrickmines.  While I appreciate that this is not solely the fault of central government, central government must do more to address the shortfall to make sure it does not happen again this year.  The real problem with yesterday's figures is they confirm the overall picture, namely, that 75% of all social housing need is being met by subsidised private rental tenancies through HAP, the RAS and leasing.  It is the casualisation of social housing.  It is almost like zero-hour contracts in the social housing space, but it is also very expensive and it crowds non-social housing tenants out of the private rental market.  The Minister is wrong when he states that they are rebalancing.  Rebuilding Ireland wants to have 90,000 additional HAP tenancies by 2021.  We are going to have more subsidised private rental tenancies than ever before at a higher cost if this plan meets its targets, which it seems to do on that front.<\/p>  <p>  How do I know Rebuilding Ireland is not working?  Last year, the total number of real social houses was just under 7,000.  How many new households came onto the social housing waiting list last year?  The answer is 14,000.  If, therefore, one is producing housing to meet the needs of half the number of new applicants, how is one ever going to deal with historic need let alone future need?  It would take the Government 20 years to do so, which is how we know this plan is not working.<\/p>  <p>  The question is what we need.  We know what we need because almost everybody else bar the Government is telling us.  We need a rights-based approach to housing and we need to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  We do not need more time.  The Constitutional Convention recommended this approach by a majority of 84% in 2014.  In fact, there was a deal between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to deny the housing committee the right to deal with the issue.  It is buried in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and we will never see the outcome of that, which is really what is going on, not deliberation.  We need a doubling of capital investment in social and affordable housing to meet real targets and real need.  We need action to freeze rents and, in Sinn F&eacute;in's view, to take the pressure off struggling renters with a refundable tax credit.  We also need greater action to prevent the flow of families into homelessness, including the introduction of the Focus Ireland amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Our position has not changed since the previous debate on the matter.  This plan is failing.  This Government is failing.  The Minister, who is not even here to listen to the rest of the debate, is failing.  We need a new plan.  The only thing that is going to change the Government is massive protest on the streets, both through the Raise the Roof campaign throughout the course of this year and the National Homeless and Housing Coalition mobilisation in Dublin on 9 March.  When Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael see the strength of public anger at the failings of the Government's policy, we might perhaps see some change but I do not think we will see anything until then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400028#EE00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1550154600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Broughan, Clare Daly, Joan Collins, Wallace and Connolly for tabling the motion.  Sinn F&eacute;in stands squarely and proudly beside them on this campaign regarding housing and, in particular, addressing the most dire need for housing that exist within the State.  I refer to those who have no home at all and are currently living in emergency accommodation in hotels, hostels, bed and breakfast accommodation, family hubs, reception centres or anywhere else.  That is totally unsuitable for continuous habitation by a human being.  It is as simple as that.  Shelter is the most basic need of humanity, along with food and water.  For a night, shelter might be a roof over one's head or a shield from the elements.  In the long term, however, shelter can only be determined by a secure, affordable and comfortable home that suits the needs of those who live in it.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 10,000 people in the State are homeless.  I am not referring to those who are struggling to pay rent or people who are living in overcrowded, damp conditions or unhealthy housing, I am referring to those who do not even have that.  One person in every 500 in the State is homeless.  I really do not think the Government gets it.  There are 10,000 people who are homeless.  The only conclusion that I can draw is that if it does get it, then the Government just does not care.  I fear the latter is the case.  Homeless people probably do not vote Fine Gael.  If I had the names of those 10,000 people and if I were to read them into the record, it would probably take until 10 p.m.  The human tragedy behind the figures is a stain on our nation and the Government.  The damage done will only truly be known in years to come, but it is not too late to turn back the tide.  Sadly, there is no sign of the Government taking action to do so.  We have a national emergency.  It is plain to see.  Every decent-minded person can see it.<\/p><p>We need to begin to seriously build houses.  We need to invest in our future by building new council housing, publicly owned and protected from the greed of the market which turns basic human need into unbridled profit.<\/p> <p> We need to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  That is not a solution in itself but it would certainly send a very strong message.  We need to end the long-term use of emergency accommodation now.  We need the members of Fianna F&aacute;il to step up and put their money where their mouth is on crucial issues like this.  They can no longer pretend to care about the homeless and about human suffering when they sit on their hands and allow Fine Gael policy to continue the disastrous legacy their party started in the Celtic tiger years.<\/p> <p> I refer to something that is not directly linked to this motion and that I have raised many times with the Minister.  The rent pressure zones are an absolute disaster and are not working.  They are certainly not working in east Cork.  Another problem we should be looking at in the short term, because it is an emergency, is the fact we do not have any local emergency accommodation in rural towns.  The Government is sending everybody into the city and saturating the system.  It breaks families up.  The local connection is gone, people get into bad situations, which evolve, and things get worse.  The Minister of State looked bewildered and did not believe us when we said there was a housing emergency.  I suggest the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, which are in a coalition, wake up and smell the coffee and realise there is a housing emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400028#EE00500","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550155200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I would like to thank Deputy Broughan and his colleagues for tabling this motion.  It gives us an opportunity to talk about homelessness again.  We have not seen any of the real and substantial progress we need to address it from the Government.  This morning the Minister said the social housing delivery figures for 2018 were good news and talked them up.  The changes are minimal and are nowhere near the kind of numbers that the Government itself has accepted we need in order to address the housing crisis.  There does not seem to be any significant change in policy.  I refer to the decision to use available State land, most of which is owned by local authorities.  Housing experts like Mr. Mel Reynolds have said there is enough local authority-owned land zoned for housing to build 30,000 units in the Dublin region and 50,000 in the State as a whole.  The solution is to build social and affordable housing for the people who currently need it on land the State owns.  However, that does not seem to be the solution the Government is pursuing.  The main increase in the figures published today is once again in HAP, which was never meant to be a substitute for the construction of social housing.  The number of payments has increased to 17,926 in 2018 while the build figure is below the target.  It has increased from 2,297 in 2017 to 4,251 in 2018, but the target for 2018 was 4,409.  It has not reached its target.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, nearly 4,000 children are living in homeless accommodation.  We must focus on those children.  I know a family with two young children, both in primary school, that has been living in hotels for almost a year.  There are many other families like that.  As a result of the number of cases that have come to its attention, the office of the Ombudsman for Children is doing serious research on the effects on children of being in homelessness for a long time.  There are serious and life-altering effects on young children.  We just cannot leave them in that situation when we have solutions.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Curran on rapid-build housing.  Rapid-build housing was supposed to deliver what it said on the tin, that is, rapid building, but it seems to have been abandoned.  There is no evidence whatsoever that it is producing homes at an increased rate.  That is one of the failures of Housing First.  There are many others.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on Traveller accommodation.  The outcome for last year means that less than half of the money allocated was spent.  That is an indictment of policy implementation.  The policy is there, but the implementation is not.  That is about communication between the Department and the local authorities.  They must ensure that if money cannot be spent in the way identified at the beginning of the year, it should be spent in other ways.  We all know Travellers living in appalling conditions whose circumstances could be improved if that money was spent.  The Minister said there are objections and various problems, but if the Government cannot spend money one way, it can spend it another.  That money should be spent.  Objections should not be taken as seriously as they apparently are.  We need to get on with improving the lives of Traveller children.<\/p>  <p>  In the time I have left, I will look at the data presented to us and in the Minister's statement this morning.  He talked about improvements like the delivery of eight times more social housing units in 2018 than in 2015.  He also talked about improvements on last year.  The telling little piece of the statement was the exclusion of voids.  As far as I know, this is the first time voids have been being excluded.  Perhaps the Minister of State will correct me.  In fact, the output of voids went down from 1,757 in 2017 to 560.

The Government says it appreciates that things are bad, but that they are getting better.<\/p><p>We have been dealing with that response from this Government and the previous Government for years.  The situation is getting worse and the spin from the Government is increasing because it has to try to bridge the gap between the propaganda and the reality as the reality continues to worsen and the propaganda has to pretend it is improving.<\/p> <p> Oliver Callan has a tweet which encapsulates the issue very well.  He shows an article from the end of 2017 in which the Taoiseach pledges 7,000 social homes in 2018 and an article from a couple of days ago in which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government says that the number of new social homes are on target, with 4,000 social homes being delivered.  That is a broad, expansive definition of social housing, illustrating that gulf between the reality and the propaganda of the Government.<\/p> <p> The only way out of this Groundhog Day is a mass movement.  We can, and should, continue to table motions and legislation before the House but that will not change the mind of the Government.  It will not fundamentally change the mind of Fianna F&aacute;il either because one in four of its Members is a landlord - the number is even higher in the Cabinet - and the interests they represent, not in terms of personal interests but class interests, are the landlord class, the developer class and the banker class who have an interest in the housing crisis continuing.  A mass movement on housing is essential.  It is the only way to force any change whatsoever.<\/p> <p> That is why the upcoming regional demonstrations and the demonstration in Dublin organised by the National Homeless and Housing Coalition at 2 p.m. on Saturday, 9 March, with three meeting points - the Housing Agency on Mount Street, the GPO and City Hall - is important with the demand for public and affordable housing for all and an end to evictions and homelessness.  That movement is developing; it is coming.  The energy we saw on the streets in support of the nurses and midwives, and paramedics last Saturday will also feed into it and be seen on those demonstrations.<\/p> <p> I refer to a case that I have raised here previously, which is an extreme illustration of the scale of the housing crisis.  Constituents of mine in Tallaght Cross are in properties owned by T&uacute;ath Housing, which is traditional housing for those coming out of homelessness.  People who have been living in hotels or homeless hubs are put into transitional housing with 18-month leases.  At the end of those leases, they get notices to quit, are pursued through the RTB and threatened with eviction back into homelessness.  Effectively, they are still in homelessness and they are threatened with going back into homelessness.  We raised this before Christmas with the Minister and he said that nobody would be made homeless.  Nobody has been made homeless but the threatening letters continue and people are still faced with the prospect of being taken to the RTB.  I had a meeting with them last week and they are understandably concerned.  The letters and the threats of evictions of people who are effectively in homelessness back into worse homelessness need to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400029#FF01600","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550155800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>The reason we have a housing crisis is the Government, and the two major parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, believe that housing is a means to make money for certain people in society.  The Irish rich have always got rich through property.  The property owners who see property as a means to make money are disproportionately represented in this House and the Irish rich disproportionately, in international terms, get rich from property.  They do not want to resolve the problem and their commitment to making money from property is the reason we have a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Tragically, an economic crash in 2008 that was caused by the greed of people making money out of property, rather than leading to people saying we need a fundamental rethink and that housing should be seen as a human right to be provided by a decent society, has been used as an opportunity, primarily through the vehicles of the banks and NAMA, to further enrich a certain layer of people who make money from property.<\/p>  <p>  What I heard the Minister, Deputy Murphy, talk about earlier is just rubbish.  He said we were moving in the right direction in the same week that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which is dominated by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, and assisted by the Green Party in this particular instance, flogged off land wholly owned by it in Cherrywood to - guess who - Johnny Ronan.  The boys are back in town, facilitated by the State and the major political parties.  When we opposed the plan to sell off that land, we were told by the council that it could not be used for council housing.  Apparently, there were some problems with the land.  It was too low or something like that.  All of that was rubbish because it has now been sold to Johnny Ronan, one of the guys who helped crash the economy, and he will build 140 apartments there and make a lot of money from them.<\/p>  <p>  We are hearing a lot of nonsense from the Government while in reality the policy continues to be to see land and property as an opportunity to enrich the rich and make them richer.  That is the reason the crisis continues to escalate.  For the Government to say it is moving in the right direction in some sense is nonsense.  Its own targets, which it has missed, were pathetic in the first instance, as we have been saying since Rebuilding Ireland was launched.  To try to solve a massive social housing crisis when three quarters of social housing provision will depend on the private sector was a disastrous policy in the first instance and guaranteed to continue the housing crisis but the Government has not even met its own pathetic targets.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever minimal progress was made in the past year or two, it will get worse in the next few years.  We had a small increase in social housing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other places because the pressure was on.  When we look at what is in the pipeline in many areas, social housing provision will diminish in the next few years.  Only 56 houses will be delivered in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown in the next two years and the target is 1,500.<\/p>  <p>  People have to get out on the streets.  As in the case of water charges, unless we have tens of thousands of people affected by this housing crisis out on the streets in Dublin on 9 March, which is the next opportunity to do it, we will not resolve this diabolical, shameful housing and homelessness crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400030#GG00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1550155800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Carol Nolan who is sharing with Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400030#GG00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1550155800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independents for allocating some of their time to me.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; 13,000 duine gan d&iacute;dean sa St&aacute;t seo.

Homelessness is becoming all too prevalent and, to our shame in this State, it is becoming normalised.  Homelessness is not just confined to urban regions.  Its prevalence is now very noticeable in many rural towns.  In many towns in Laois and Offaly, such as Tullamore, Edenderry and Portlaoise, rent costs up to &euro;1,000 per month.  That factor alone is driving families into homelessness every day of the week.  Every day of the week, I have upset and disillusioned people in my offices who are in desperate situations seeking accommodation.  Many of them are working part time.  They have tried their best to make ends meet and they find themselves in this difficult situation.<\/p>  <p>  The local authorities in Laois and Offaly are doing their utmost to deal with the issue of homelessness.  I have seen that first hand, but they are hampered in their efforts by insufficient funding from central Government.  In Offaly, there are very few centres or hotels providing emergency accommodation for families who find themselves homeless and experiencing the trauma that goes with that.  The Simon Community and one local hotel provide such accommodation in Tullamore but it is insufficient to meet the numbers seeking emergency accommodation.  However, those services become full very quickly, which leads to a situation where women and children have to travel to a hostel in Mullingar while the men have to travel to County Longford for emergency accommodation.  The separation of families and the breakup of the family unit can be traumatic.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree with that.  It is like something one would hear about Famine times when families were split up and sent to the workhouses.  We are seeing echoes of that now yet we are hearing the constant spin about a republic of opportunity and fairness for all in society.  That is not the case.<\/p><p>The gap is widening all of the time.  It is because this Government has not acted in time.  I accept that there have been some small improvements but they are minimal.  The Government needs to look at the rural towns.  All too often this problem of homelessness is seen as just an urban problem in our big cities.  It is not and it is far from it.  I would like some action to ensure that there is more emergency accommodation available in County Laois and County Offaly so that people do not have to leave their counties.  I know of families who have had to leave their county to go to hostels in Mullingar and who have had to uproot their children who were in schools in Tullamore and surrounding areas.  That is so destructive.  It is traumatic enough for children to be separated from their fathers or the head in the family, whoever that may be, but it is shameful that we have this situation.  We talk about mental health and all that is being done in that area but this situation is adding to that problem of mental health and we are not getting to grips with that either.  Rents are increasing month on month in the main towns of the counties I have just mentioned, in Tullamore, Edenderry and Portlaoise.<\/p> <p> The solution to this problem of spiralling rents needs to be looked at urgently.  The criteria for rent pressure zones must be broadened in order to ensure that towns where there are ongoing problems with rent increases outside of the main cities are catered for and assisted.  This would be a lifeline to many tenants in rented accommodation.  As has been stated already, HAP is a short term solution.  I know of many cases in Offaly and Laois where people have to top up the HAP payment by hundreds of euros.  They have no choice, they are in a vulnerable situation and in order to stay in their accommodation they have to fork that out.  That is sometimes done by getting loans from family members or worse, borrowing off moneylenders and that is what is happening.  As the Minister of State may not know, the midlands region has one of the lowest rates of income in this State.  This must surely be taken into consideration in ensuring that our towns in Laois and Offaly are designated as rent pressure zones.  I call on the Minister of State to pursue that possibility in light of the ongoing homeless crisis and the shortage of social and affordable housing for families in Laois and Offaly.  It must end.  We need Government intervention and we need it fast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400030#GG00400","speaker":"1440","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550156400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Before the house is built, planning is needed, roads and sewers must be put in and there is an awful problem in this country in that we do not do a bit of planning ahead of building a house.  We think it will just fall down out of the sky.  Right around this country the State owns a lot of land and it has never pursued an objective of putting in sewage treatment plants, having the water there, making sure that the planning has gone through and having the roads put in because that is when building can commence.  In fairness to the former Minister in the Department, Deputy Coveney, we saw in 2016 in Dublin where he brought councillors together and got the whole thing sorted in O'Devaney Gardens and this is 2019 and the council has still not put in planning permission.  How can houses be built on that because when we look at it it will take three or four years more?  There are companies coming into this country and they have to try to get housing for their people.  Those companies are able to compete better than any individual and they will buy the houses in an area.  If we are not careful, we will see that it will be landlord country inside the M50 in Dublin because people will not be able to afford the housing.<\/p>  <p>  The housing issue is ongoing and I am not directing this at the Minister of State but I question some of the stuff that goes on within the Department.  I spoke to the Minister of State in recent days and in fairness he is as helpful as a person can be, but the Department has rules and regulations and there is no one with a bit of what I would call cop on or common sense who will turn around and say they will sort a particular issue because it will cause a problem down the line.  Fr. Peter McVerry said that we have 12,500 buy to lets that are in trouble currently.  It is not the people who are losing those houses, it is the people who are living in them and renting them.  We cannot afford to let them move on again.<\/p>  <p>  I am saying this and I may be as well off talking to the wall but there is only one way of solving housing.  We have State land and we need to put in a system where we can get planning through, irrespective of the objectors and everything else that is happening.  We just have to drive it on currently because this is an emergency and we have to get housing going.  Roads, sewers and water have to be brought in and then it is a simple job to tell a subcontractor or the man who will price it what to do.  It will not be like the hospital job up the road.  It will be so much money per sq. ft. and it will be a built at a price.  Affordable housing can be built that way because there are young people in the front line services, especially in the big cities around the country, who cannot afford to live in the area.  There will be pressure on wages if we keep going down that road.  I am looking at the Department for a while and the Minister of State must bring in seven or eight of the top people from outside who know how to go for the throat in doing things efficiently and have a group who will drive this on.  I am not saying it is the Minister of State's fault because he cannot deliver the sun, moon and stars but his Department needs a woeful looking at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400031#HH00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1550156400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is extremely helpful so my comments are about a housing crisis.  The housing crisis has not been caused by difficult tenants, people refusing houses or indeed people objecting to planning permissions although we will always have a small minority.  They certainly did not create the housing crisis however: it is a deliberate crisis caused as a result of the policies of successive Governments and we know that.  The Government is picking up the pieces and I appreciate that but it is also part of the problem.  The Minister of State and the Government believe that the market will provide and the market has not provided.<\/p><p>In 2009, in Galway city we stopped building houses.  We just stopped.  We bailed out the banks and we looked after everybody but we did not look after the ordinary people on the ground.  That was bad enough except we created the problem and no social houses have been built in Galway and the Minister of State knows that.  I have all the reports before me and there has been some progress.  Some 14 houses were built in Galway between 2009 and 2018.  To put the beautiful city of Galway that I come from in perspective, it is second worst in terms of rent in the country.  We have most of the debate in the media on Dublin.  The report from the council is that Galway is the second worst and <i>daft.ie<\/i>has confirmed that it has risen by 13%.<\/p><p>A major contributory factor in landlords existing the RAS scheme alone is that tenants cannot pay close to the current market rents and this is a rent pressure zone.  The landlords who are there are exiting the market.  We have over 4,000 households on the waiting list in Galway.  Some of them have been on that waiting list since 2002.  I know that for a fact because they are in and out of my office on a regular basis.  I am unsure of the number of people but we have 50 families in emergency accommodation.  That emergency accommodation cost &euro;2.5 million last year.  To be precise, it was &euro;2.455197 million.  That is not to mention any of the shelters or any of the other measures.  The families in emergency accommodation, as has been said, do not cover the women who have fled homes as a result of domestic violence, nor does it cover the hundreds of people who are in direct provision and who cannot get out even though they have achieved status because there is no accommodation available.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, talked about social mix and I appreciate that he has other things on today and I make no point on that except what I heard him say this morning.  I thought I was beyond despair, but when the Minister talks about the HAP payment being helpful in having a social mix I really want to give up.  Some &euro;431 million was spent on HAP this year.  It went from &euro;150 million in 2017, it doubled in 2018 and it is going up to &euro;431 million and possibly &euro;500 million this year in HAP payments.  Each year it is increasing and doubling to back up the private market artificially and then we wonder why rents are rising and rising.  Galway city has 26 ha of land zoned residential alone.  In addition and not counted in that, we have Ceannt Station with something like 14 acres of land.  We have the docklands with acres of land.  We have 150 acres between Galway City Council and Galway County Council in the former airport.  That is not to mention institutional land.<\/p><p>I thank my colleague for tabling this motion and for the work that has gone into it in declaring a crisis.

The focus on solutions to homelessness has largely been a city wide perspective.  While this is warranted, it is important to focus on the rise of rural homelessness, for example, in my constituency of Donegal.<\/p><p>The resources, staffing and financing that Dublin and other cities receive to help combat the growing tide of homelessness are not the same as those afforded to rural constituencies such as Donegal.  In fact, we still do not know how many people are homeless in rural Ireland because the Housing First response to homelessness has not trickled across the country.<\/p> <p> The official figure for the number of people homeless in Donegal, as documented by the Department, is 12.  That figure is incorrect.  Homeless shelters in Donegal are full to capacity, and that amounts to at least 20 adults in one shelter I know.  It has also become evident that county councils record homelessness in different ways.  The pathway accommodation and support system, PASS, is being used inconsistently across the board.  Ideally, people who present themselves as homeless to the council are automatically logged in and wrap-around supports are provided.  In Donegal, it is a different story.  Homelessness is only visible between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. while the council doors remain open.  Help switches off at 5 p.m.  For example, a woman fleeing domestic violence in the middle of the night cannot be registered because there is no out-of-hours PASS system in Donegal.<\/p> <p> There is a narrow definition of what homelessness means in Donegal.  Anyone in sheltered accommodation, temporary accommodation or couch surfing is not considered homeless and, as is happening to a family in Letterkenny this week, a family that does not have habitual residency status cannot be registered as homeless.  We also do not have an accurate estimate of the number of people with mental health issues leaving mental health services who end up homeless.  If we do not have the numbers, we will not have a solution.<\/p> <p> In this crisis a system such as PASS should not become a closed user group to which only a select few individuals have access.  NGOs are not automatically contacted to deal with an individual, as is the case in Galway, Cork and Dublin, so people do not get the wrap-around supports they need.  People are going to Derry where they will get help to a certain extent.  The Minister must ensure that resources go where they are needed.  Greater oversight is required to ensure councils reform their systems for recording homelessness.  This could be done through a circular in which the Minister decides how homelessness should be recorded.  Resources are also needed to provide dedicated case workers with solutions tailored to the individual on hand, in addition to funding for more homeless action teams, including for out-of-hours services.<\/p> <p> Despite billions of euro being spent to solve homelessness, the response has been too slow, inconsistent and system-led.  Housing First has not been adequately adopted throughout the country, but perhaps that serves to keep the numbers lower.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400031#HH00400","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550157000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Broughan for tabling this motion.

He has given me until May.  I have been in rented accommodation since 2001.  I am a single of mother of 2.  My son is 17 and daughter is 6.  I have spoken to the local council and to Threshold about my situation.  I am constantly looking to rent somewhere else and I am at a loss.  The properties are getting snapped up by professionals.  I can&rsquo;t go into emergency housing as I have to wait until closer to the time that I am due to leave the house.  I am beginning to panic.  I am a lone parent and it's up to me to provide security for my kids.  My daughter is 6 and she offered me her savings box to buy a house today god love her innocence.  This is not a feel sorry for me email; this is real life stuff.  I am not a victim I am simply a mother who is looking to provide housing for her children.<\/blockquote><p>There is also Caroline, who wrote to me months ago.  Again, the landlord was selling and she did not know where she would go.  She wrote:<\/p><blockquote>I cannot afford to rent privately as &euro;1600 a month is way out my budget.  I have lived in Swords all my life, my kids go to school there and I work beside the airport.  I cannot afford a mortgage on my own and have no idea what my options are.<\/blockquote><p>The months since then have evaporated and she has written to me again.  She still has nowhere to go.  Like every other Deputy, I get emails like that every week.  There is nothing I can tell these people except that they should look for a private rented house even though I know they are not available and that they will not get one.  It is an absolute scandal in this day and age.  That is aside from our veteran Defence Forces personnel who ran a valiant campaign with Tricolour sleeping bags on the streets to highlight the way we treat men and women who loyally served the State.<\/p><p>The housing policy is not working.

Deputy Paul Murphy wants to hold a big march in a few weeks.  That is fine.  He should hold the march, but be honest with people.  The last time there was a big march I listened to the message from the campaign, which was to deliver 10,000 social houses.  That is what we are doing.  Deputy Joan Collins nodded her head.  She wants that, and it is sought in the motion.  That is what is happening in 2019.  Members sanctioned that budget.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that Members have a difference with us about delivery.  We are saying there will be 10,000 additional social houses.  Approximately 6,500 of them will be directly built by local authorities.  It appears Members do not wish to give any credit to local authorities for the work they do with AHBs and with the different sectors in acquiring vacant properties and bringing them back into use.  They do that work as well.  Their job is to deliver houses, not just to build new houses.  Naturally, we want them to build more new houses every year but it is wrong to say that one can solve a housing problem by just building social houses from day one and doing nothing else.<\/p>  <p>  Members raised issues with HAP, using the private sector and so forth.  More than 40,000 families are in HAP houses today.  Has anybody here got a solution for those 40,000 people tomorrow?  There is no other quick solution.  We have to use, engage with and rely on the private sector in the short term.  However, that is not the only plan.  The plan is to reduce that after a couple of years when the housing supply is increased.<\/p><p>However, one must first build the houses.  In the meantime, people must avail of HAP or some other form of support.  Some Members do not seem to like it but no other solution has been put forward.  I ask them to bear that in mind.<\/p> <p> In recent debates on this issue, Members raised situations involving persons living in emergency accommodation for two or three years and so on, and such situations are referred to in the motion.  However, when I looked into the detail of the cases raised, I discovered there was more to the story.  In some cases, the person was offered HAP accommodation but refused it as it did not suit his or her needs.  In other cases, the person was seeking a council house within a small geographical area, which limited the available housing options.  There is more to the story. The majority of people do not spend two or three years in emergency accommodation although, sadly, some do.  We wish they did not.  People are offered various options and solutions, but those solutions may not always suit their needs.  However, some Deputies are trying to create the perception that everyone who enters emergency accommodation is left there for two or three years and that there are no solutions.  The fact is that approximately 5,000 adults, along with their children, left a homelessness in 2018, slightly more than was the case in 2017.  The difficulty and sadness for us all is that just as many came back into homelessness.  I do not deny that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400032#JJ02600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550157600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is finally addressing the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400033#KK00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1550157600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>It is unfair to those providing services, including NGOs, local authorities and AHBs, for Members to give the impression that nothing is improving.  It is not true.  It has been repeatedly alleged that the Government only wishes to use private housing but that is not true either.  A building programme is in place to increase the stock of social housing by 50,000 over the next three or four years.  More than 20,000 social houses have been delivered since we began the programme two and a half years ago and more than 50,0000 will be delivered by the time it is completed.  The Government is committed to going beyond that provision but it will take time to do so.  It will not happen overnight, although I wish it did as it would make my job and that of the Minister far easier.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated that the Government is doing nothing to solve the long-term problem of housing waiting lists because there are 70,000 on them and that number is growing every year.  The Sinn F&eacute;in housing plan, which has only been worked out on paper and has not been tested, aims to deliver fewer houses than the Government plans to provide.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to deliver 100,000 houses.  Our plan, which has been funded and put into action, will deliver 120,000 houses.  The sites have been identified and services are being provided.  The necessary funding has been allocated to the plan and it will deliver houses.  It is more difficult for the Government because we must do things for real.  It is easy to draw up a plan.  However, the Sinn F&eacute;in plan proposes to deliver fewer houses than the Government intends to deliver.  We need to have an honest conversation about what everyone hopes to achieve and get real about what can be delivered.  <\/p>  <p>  On voids, I wish to clarify that approximately 1,760 properties belonging to local authorities and which had been lying empty were brought back into usage last year.  A figure of 560 was used for the purposes of recording delivery of new accommodation because the Government was accused at the housing committee a couple of years ago of massaging the figures by counting voids as new properties.  As a result, the Minister changed how the figures were recorded.  He parked the properties originally allocated under Rebuilding Ireland and numbering approximately 560.  However, the reality is that 1,760 were brought back into use.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised the issue of voids in Limerick.  Funding has been allocated to that issue.  Limerick City and County Council is doing great work on housing.  There is a significant volume of activity and many properties are being delivered.  However, there is an issue regarding some voids, which are a little more costly to deliver than the norm, but that will be sorted out.  I hope that they will soon be back in use.  Many void properties remain in Dublin and elsewhere and they will be brought back into use.  Thankfully, the local authorities in most counties have brought their voids back into use.  There has been much progress.  There should not be any empty stock belonging to the State.<\/p>  <p>  On Donegal, the picture painted by Deputy Pringle is a little different from that depicted by others.  I do not accuse the Deputy of misrepresenting the facts.  However, yesterday I met representatives of Donegal County Council yesterday who were very clear in terms of the delivery of housing in the county and the various options they are pursuing.  They are making great progress.  We accept this is not just an urban problem.  The required funding has been allocated.  If additional or out-of-hours services are required in Donegal, that can be considered.  The funding is available for such measures and there should be no difficulty putting them in place.  The picture painted by the Deputy is a little different from that presented by Donegal County Council or other representatives of the area.  We must ascertain the true position.  If certain services are required, I am happy to ensure they are put in place.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the situation in County Laois . The perception was given that there is no money for housing there.  I met representatives of Laois County Council yesterday and made it very clear, as did the Minister, that money is available for emergency services, acquiring more properties, building more new houses, buying vacant properties and so on.  The local authority did not tell us that it is short of money.  We recognise that the homelessness and emergency accommodation problems are spread across the country and do not only affect cities.  We do not differentiate between rural and urban areas.  We know there are difficulties in rural areas.  When I was appointed to this post two years ago, I met representatives of rural areas and told them that homelessness would also become a problem in rural areas and that we should put plans in place to deal with that.  We are happy to have family hubs and other forms of emergency accommodation in all counties but the local authorities must request them; they are in charge.  Money is available to make it happen.<\/p>  <p>  I do not deny that there is a problem in housing - nobody does - but housing supply has increased.  When the Action Plan for Jobs was being discussed three years ago, many Members said the jobs in the plan were not real jobs.  Unfortunately, in those days I could not bring people to see the jobs.  I am glad that I can now bring Members to all of the sites on which work is under way.  Houses are being built.  Families are living in houses provided under the plan.  I have no problem with Members wanting more housing delivery.   We all want more houses to be delivered.  The job of the Government is to make that happen.  We must ensure that houses are being built on the 251 active sites and that the required infrastructure is being provided.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to Mr. Mel Reynolds and the State land in Dublin which he claims is suitable for housing.  If one examines his claims, one will discover that he identifies green space, parks and many other types of land as potential sites for construction.  It is not all suitable for housing.  A Member quoting an expert should be sure to understand what the expert is saying.  We want to use any suitable and available land for housing.  We are using State-owned land to deliver more housing.  The housing activity of local authorities is eight times what it was two and a half years ago but we have asked them to double or treble that.  Members must acknowledge that doing so involves putting teams, personnel and infrastructure in place and ensuring that taxpayers' money to fund it is available.  It does not happen overnight but they are committed to doing it because I agree with Members that local authorities should build houses.  They want to do so but they are also required to provide housing using the other streams.  They are doing so and they are delivering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400033#KK00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1550157600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>The Minister of State and I are probably tired of listening to each other at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400033#KK00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1550157600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400033#KK00500","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1550157600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>We would not have to go over this issue again and again if the problems were going away.

Approximately 20 social houses Wexford were built in 2018.  That does not come close to dealing with the problem.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated previously, I was very disheartened when the Government came up with the idea of the Land Development Agency.  It was soul destroying.  I do not understand why the Government would turn over State land to developers.  The sites will provide 10% social housing and 60% private housing.  The Government states that 30% will be affordable housing, but the average price of those properties will be approximately &euro;330,000, which is unaffordable for most people.  I do not understand the rationale behind that policy.  If the Government thinks local authorities are unable to deliver housing, why does it not make them fit for purpose?  Are they out of control?  Has the Government no handle on them?  I would like to think that the Government could sort out any local authorities that are not fit for purpose.  If that task is beyond it, we are in trouble.<\/p><p> At a Dublin economics workshop less than a year ago, Mr. Niall Cussen, the head planner in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, said in response to a question on social housing that we will not be building social housing at scale and that we have tried it before.

If the local authorities are not fit to build or provide housing, why does the Government not create an entity to do so?  It does not have to be a big quango.

I agree with the Minister that supply is key to breaking the logjam.  The point, however, is that for most of the past eight years, there has been no supply.  I agree very much with my colleague Deputy Wallace that the Government had a choice either to empower the local authorities or set up a State building company that would build on out from the sites it has.  The Minister of State asked me to show him what is occurring.  We meet people who have been in homeless accommodation week in, week out, for two years plus.  I could take the Minister of State to at least half a dozen large sites that are partially or totally owned by Dublin City Council and where there has been no movement not only for the last eight years but for the past 28 years.  That is the problem.  In many respects, the authorities have been hamstrung legally.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, asked what we would do differently.  We have had to drag the Government kicking and screaming towards every little improvement, whether it was addressing the rights of tenants to some extent or the situation with rents.  This was to begin to have even a minuscule direct-build housing programme for the councils and approved housing bodies.  The man who was Minister for Finance for most of the past eight years, Deputy Michael Noonan, always put the interests of banks and the financial sector in front of the interests of the homeless.  That is the reality.  The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has continued with that policy, by and large, right up to the present.  That is the sad reality of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has talked about emergency powers.  Emergency powers were adopted in a few hours in 2008.  My Labour Party colleagues at the time and I stood alone against the blanket bank guarantee.  Deputy Noonan and I were both on the back benches and we knew exactly the meaning of the blanket bank guarantee.  My colleagues and I stood against it.  The current Government has an omnibus Bill.  The Minister was discussing it this morning.  If a hard Brexit happens, we will come in here and, in about two or three hours, we will legislate across the board to protect this country and our people in the North.  That is what we are going to do and we know we are going to do it but the Government will not do it for the homeless people.  It is refusing to take action on behalf of the 10,000 homeless - or, according to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, 13,000 - and the 8,000 homeless children.  It is just making glacial progress and will not take the drastic action that is necessary, which has been outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace is the most experienced of us but, like others in this Chamber, I have worked on building sites also.  When I worked on sites, we were building a very large housing development in south County Dublin for Dublin City Council.  It was a major development in east Clondalkin.  We know what has been done and what can be done.  The Government is refusing to do what can be done.  It is all pie in the sky.  References are made to 2020, 2021 and 2022.  The 2020s look like they will be the Roaring Twenties again.  It will be fabulous and we will have houses coming on stream year in, year out, but the problem is that so many families have suffered so much.  The Government could prevent this in a couple of weeks by getting moving on some of the sites.  In Dublin Bay North alone, we could probably build 15,000 or 20,000 houses over a couple of years, with the proper powers for either Dublin City Council or the four Dublin councils together.  Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council are inextricably linked.  We are all Dubs and we all wear the blue shirt, including when we have to put it on to support our brilliant Gaelic teams.  We need to work together on housing also, as we always did, including when Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan and all the inner suburbs were built.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State has failed in a key remit.  This whole issue and the failures in the health service will lead to a very serious depletion of the ranks of the Fine Gael Party in the forthcoming general election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400034#LL01500","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550158200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550158200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 21 February 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400034#LL01700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1550158800,"counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400035#MM00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550158800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550158800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the general principles of the Bill and it will examine potential amendments if necessitated.  It is something we are discussing at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill aims to strengthen consumer protections relating to the sale and use of gift vouchers, with the market largely unregulated in Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;il has led the way in the Oireachtas on enhancing consumer safeguards via the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Bill 2017.  A Fianna F&aacute;il Bill to regulate gift vouchers with a minimum five-year expiry date passed the D&aacute;il unanimously last June on Second Stage while pre-legislative scrutiny took place last October.  However, mysteriously, the Government has refused to grant a money message to advance our Bill to Committee Stage over the past five months and instead, in a cynical turn, has decided to rush forward its own proposal in an attempt to cover up its tardiness in legislating for consumers in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Fine Gael-led Governments have sat on a 2015 consumer rights Bill to regulate gift vouchers, citing EU legislation coming down the road, which would have primacy over domestic legislation as the reason for not proceeding.  However, the goalposts have been changed and this excuse is seemingly no longer applicable as the Government tried to fast-track its Bill.  This approach to legislation knows no bounds as public relations trump substance at every occasion, something that permeates from the Taoiseach down.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill, on Second Stage today, includes a five-year minimum expiry date.  It also prohibits the following two unfair terms for the sale of gift vouchers.  This applies to traders who require vouchers to be expended in full in a single transaction and the requirement to pay a fee to amend the name of the gift voucher recipient.<\/p>  <p>  Section 1 provides for the definition of the principal Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 2 provides for the introduction of a minimum five-year expiry period for gift vouchers.  In addition, it provides that traders must inform consumers of the expiry date.  Two unfair terms are to be prohibited.  The first is where traders require gift vouchers to be spent in full in a single transaction.  The second provides for a prohibition on the requirement to pay a fee to amend the name of the recipient on that gift voucher.  The section also provides for offence provisions for contraventions of the section.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 3 provides for consequential amendments to the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 4 provides for the Short Title as well as the collective citation and commencement.<\/p>  <p>  We are told there will be a modest cost to the Exchequer arising from the additional enforcement activity that will be undertaken by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  Gift vouchers and gift cards currently remain unregulated in this country.  A survey carried out in 2013, undertaken for the National Consumer Agency, NCA, found that 80% of people had purchased gift vouchers at some point.  Estimates suggest that between 1% and 2% of gift vouchers redeemable in many outlets go unredeemed.  I am culpable of that myself.  Some 8% to 10% of gift vouchers that are redeemable in a single retailer or service provider may not be redeemed.  However, consumers receiving the gift vouchers are often left unaware of the terms and conditions that apply.  Specifically, the time that vouchers remain valid can vary and, as a result, consumers are left short-changed when they go to redeem them.  Some retailers are more flexible than others but they currently have the right to refuse to honour the voucher outside the defined period.  This Bill provides for new provisions in regulating the sale of gift vouchers and the contracts for their supply by amending the Consumer Protection Act 2007; establishes a definition for gift vouchers; and proposes that there can be no expiry date on gift vouchers which is not less than a five-year period and all gift vouchers would remain valid for five years.  This five-year expiry date has been deployed in other jurisdictions to good effect.<\/p>  <p>  I have experience of many small shops and stores particularly in my own region.  In an awful lot of cases, even though they do not have to do it now, shop owners will put an expiry date on a voucher.  In most circumstances, local shops or stores are reasonable and, if the consumer is a few months outside the expiry date, they are more than willing to accommodate them.  Sometimes the larger stores are not as easy to deal with and they can certainly be problematic. <\/p>  <p>  We must also understand that businesses have concerns about this legislation and I acknowledge that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400035#MM00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1550158800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I am the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  My committee colleagues, including Deputy Quinlivan, and I have spent quite a bit of time focusing on the issue of gift vouchers.  We carried out pre-legislative scrutiny on a Bill brought forward by a colleague of mine, Deputy Niall Collins, and there were many similarities between the two Bills.  Regardless of where the Bill comes from, it is high time that we have legislation to protect the consumer.  That is the most important issue.<\/p>  <p>  As someone with a retail background who has worked on both sides of the counter all my working life, I have a lot of experience with gift vouchers and the way they can be exploited in different businesses and shops.  In the main, people are fair and will put an expiry date a couple of years hence on the gift voucher.  The consumer knows that if they buy a gift voucher for &euro;100, it is the same as having cash in their pocket and they will have the opportunity to spend it.  Unfortunately, some businesses, for example, are much more rigorous with their terms and conditions and, if a gift voucher expires after a year, it is as good as the consumer losing &euro;100 from their pocket as he or she does not get the opportunity to spend it.  I welcome the fact that the gift vouchers will have a five-year time limit.  That is important because sometimes people might receive a substantial gift voucher.  At Christmas, many people get gift vouchers as a tax-free bonus from work and they might spend a couple of hundred euro out of the voucher and then it goes into the back of the wallet, or it is put away and forgotten about.  It is important that the voucher is there for people and they know it will be not reduce in value.<\/p>  <p>  We have to put the consumer first and foremost.  Money is hard earned and it is important that people know that, when they buy a voucher, they are protected.  It is also important that the terms and conditions are printed clearly and consumers know what they are.  The time that vouchers remain valid can vary and it is important that there is standardisation of that across the board.  The Bill provides for new regulations on the sale of gift vouchers and the contracts for their supply by amending the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The Bill also establishes a welcome definition of gift vouchers.<\/p>  <p>  The unregulated sector of gift vouchers accounts for 65% of the market.  These are mainly single brand store cards and shopping centre cards.  There is no protection of funds loaded on cards and retailers use the fund as normal work capital and thus, if a retailer collapses, the funds are lost to consumers.  That is something we have witnessed for many years.  People with gift vouchers worth &euro;50, or &euro;100, or whatever, lose it when a business collapses.  That certainly needs to be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  The regulated sector accounts for 35% of the gift voucher market.  These would more often be electronic vouchers.  It has come to my attention that, for some gift vouchers, after a year passes the value of the voucher reduces by a small percentage every month.  One will not notice that if a gift voucher is worth a couple of hundred euro.<\/p><p>If a person has a gift voucher for &euro;20 - it could be a One4all voucher given to a grandchild by a grandparent - its value, after the 12 months expires, is reduced incrementally by a small percentage.  If one hands over &euro;20 for a voucher, then it should be worth that amount over time.  It should be the same as having cash in one&rsquo;s pocket.  Unfortunately, that is not the way it always works out.<\/p> <p> I welcome the legislation.  The business, enterprise and innovation committee did much work on this area.  One quibble I have is that the committee spent much time on pre-legislative scrutiny of a similar Private Members&rsquo; Bill and then the Government came forward with its own Bill.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is worthwhile and timely.  It was unfortunate that a good Bill, like the Private Members&rsquo; Bill in question, was accepted by the whole committee but could not receive a money message.  The Government then came forward with its own Bill.<\/p> <p> We must put the customer first and it is high time we had legislation in this area.  I hope that every Member will support the Bill and that we can move it quickly through the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400035#MM00400","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550159400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Butler.  Deputy Niall Collins brought forward a similar Private Members' Bill which the business, enterprise and innovation committee spent much time going through.  Several amendments were made to it which were all agreed unanimously by the committee.  Here we are again, however, with this Bill.  There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>because I had a Bill on ticket touting and we will be debating a Government Bill on this later.  My Bill, approved by the business, enterprise and innovation committee, was left stuck in the committee waiting for a money message, although the issue in question needed to be tackled urgently.  Obviously, the wrong name was on that Bill in the same way that Deputy Niall Collins&rsquo;s name was on the Bill similar to this.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Bill is welcome and Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting it.  Gift vouchers can be a source of great frustration for consumers when the find they have expired or have been charged fees for not using them.  The lack of regulation in this area has left consumers exposed.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission received 1,100 complaints about gift vouchers over the past several years, showing the need for urgent action.  Accordingly, Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the Bill.<\/p><p>The Bill aims to provide for a five-year expiry period for gift vouchers; prohibit terms on gift voucher contracts which require gift vouchers to be spent on single transactions; ban conditions which would impose a fee for changing the name of a recipient on a gift voucher; and provide for the publication of guidelines by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on gift vouchers.<\/p><p>While these are all welcome changes, I note the absence in the legislation for the regulation of dormancy fees on gift vouchers.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service prepared a paper on the Bill, focusing on this specific issue.  It highlighted the fact that the state of New South Wales in Australia has a law which bans post-purchase fees, including activation, account-keeping, balance inquiry and telephone inquiry fees, as well as fees applied when a card is inactive or not used.  The latter are sometimes called dormancy or inactivity fees.  In Ontario, businesses are not allowed to charge dormancy fees or activation fees.  These dormancy fees can be a big issue for many consumers as they eat away at the monetary value of the vouchers without consumers knowing.  Will the Minister of State provide more clarity as to what exactly the current position is on dormancy fees?  What impact did lobbying from gift voucher companies have on the decision to omit these fees from the legislation?<\/p><p>My party colleague, Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, raised the issue of experience vouchers with the Minister in the Seanad.  It is important we discuss how this legislation will affect gift vouchers given for experiences for, say, a hot air balloon ride, a bungee jump, adventure sports or race car driving.  These vouchers are sold as an experience with no price on them which makes them popular as an ideal gift.  However, the cost of these activities could change dramatically over the proposed new five-year expiry period.  For example, a voucher for a hot air balloon experience could be purchased now for &euro;300 with a five-year limit in force.  If the price of insurance or gas went up substantially in that timeframe, the profit margin of the company would be eliminated.<\/p><p>As we know, the problem of escalating insurance costs is going unaddressed by the Government.  It does not seem to have any interest in this issue of serious concern to most, if not all, businesses across the State.  Recently I met with stakeholders who said a tsunami is coming as businesses will not be able to afford to pay for their insurance coverage soon.<\/p><p>It is important that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions are enacted as soon as possible.  There should be more co-operation between the Government and the Opposition on bringing forward Bills which cover the same issues.  Such co-operation would lead to a quicker legislative process.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.

The Minister welcomes the broad support for the Bill.  She has also considered carefully all the points raised in the debate.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill deals with an issue of considerable importance for consumer welfare and businesses which provides goods or services to consumers.  It is clear consumers deserve greater protection with gift vouchers.  Following this debate, it is clear there is wide support for introducing a longer expiry date which will benefit all gift voucher holders, a point made by Deputy Butler.  It is equally important consumers are protected against unfair and anti-consumer practices which require the consumer to fully use the value of the voucher in one transaction, as well as the restrictions put in place by certain businesses regarding the name of the recipient.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Quinlivan referred to fees.  While the Minister remains strongly in favour of the regulation of gift voucher fees, a legal issue emerged during the course of drafting the Bill regarding the power proposed for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to make regulations fixing these fees.  The issue related to possible encroachment of the regulatory regime for electronic money products.  The office of the Attorney General did not consider, however, that this issue affected the Bill&rsquo;s provision for a five-year minimum term for gift vouchers.

As the same is not true for those who do not live in Dublin, I know the value of them there.<\/p>  <p>  The tickets for certain sports events, music shows and acts in Ireland can be at extortionate prices in many instances.  We can see the inflated prices people have to pay here when we compare prices for venues in other European cities.  In some instances it was more than double the price to attend a particular gig in Ireland than it was in other European cities.  I have met people from Ireland who will go to other cities for those events because it is cheaper, even allowing for buying a plane ticket and accommodation.  That can also apply to football matches.<\/p>  <p>  Even though the GAA have not applied a price increase in a number of years, prices of &euro;45 to stand on Hill 16 and &euro;90 to sit in the stands for an All-Ireland final are a bit over the top.  That is before we come to the subject we are discussing, which is touting which exacerbates the problem in Ireland.  The underlying issue is the actual cost of tickets in Ireland at the inflated prices.  The sporting bodies, artists and promoters all have a responsibility to address this.  We hear about certain so-called stars and acts making really outlandish demands which lead to prices being increased.  While it is not covered by the Bill, it is worth mentioning.  It is part of the reason for paying more in Ireland than in other European cities.  While the price can be high enough, it becomes way above and that is even before the tout gets his or her hands on the tickets.<\/p>  <p>  It is infuriating when we learn that a match or a concert is sold out.  I live between the 3 Arena and Croke Park and I see touts out on the streets in the vicinity of an event selling tickets at extortionate prices.  We have many examples of that.  If the Bill can do something about that, it is to be welcomed.  The Bill seems practical, with the sensible aim of tackling touting of tickets above face value, particularly those being sold at vastly above face value.  We know the extent when even reputable ticket sales companies have websites such as the much-publicised Seatwave to resell tickets at ridiculous prices.  I hope the Bill will give a layer of protection for the purchaser.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Bill is based on a Belgian model.  As Belgium is in the EU, this is compatible with EU law.  I understand it has had a positive effect in Belgium.  It is not the first attempt to introduce this type of legislation.  It was proposed previously, but hopefully it has a better chance now.  It will be illegal for anyone engaging in an organised way to block-book tickets and resell them for profit, which is positive.<\/p>  <p>  Up to now touting was a relatively small venture albeit that particular events had significant mark-ups.  However, we are now seeing extortionate touting.  It is no longer a small venture: it is a massive profit-making enterprise whereby the mainstream websites will sell out in seconds and the bulk of the tickets are then transferred to secondary websites, ironically in a notable case one owned by the mainstream seller.  It is not small-scale resale: it is an industry that seeks to profit at the expense of those who wish to attend events.  Those involved in this industry contribute nothing to the team or artist involved in or the promotion or organisation of the event.<\/p>  <p>  Seatwave, which was acquired by Ticketmaster in November 2014, allows fans who missed out on sold-out gigs to purchase official tickets.  That is what it claims and that sounds good.  It allows fans to sell their tickets even within minutes of purchase and charges a 10% success fee on sales.  Whatever about selling a ticket a few days later, a week later or a month later when one realises that an event clashes with something else, selling it minutes later would certainly raise alarm bells.  An amount of 10% may sound okay, but the reality is that in some instances it has been more than 100%.<\/p>  <p>  We know this is about the online sales of tickets, but we can go further with online selling which is totally unregulated.  I refer to my own particular interest in animal welfare.  Puppies are being sold online with false advertising in many cases.  Some of the advertisements are fronts for the dog-breeding establishments, in other words the puppy farms.  That is another example of online selling with exploitation of the buyer, which is what this Bill is about.  I know that has not come into it, but I just wanted to mention it.<\/p>  <p>  Paying over the odds for a particular event is reprehensible.  We know the pressure people can be under to source a ticket for a particular event, match or act they want to see.  That is very sad when they do their best to buy a ticket in a reputable way online and then because they are all already gone, the pressure is on to pay above the odds.  The Bill seeks to ensure that ticket sales will be conducted in a fair and transparent way, away from the shady industry that has grown up in respect of online sales and also the tout on the street.  I hope the Bill will make it better for the genuine fan.  I know in the grand scale of things other very important legislation needs to go through.  However, this issue has been let slide and left to fester for far too long.  Of course, the question is whether it will be effective.  There are concerns that it will not be effective and that amendments will be introduced to ensure it will not make much difference.  However, it is worth considering.  We need to get this right to bring fairness for people who want to attend events, whether they are music gigs or sporting events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400037#OO00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1550160000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Wallace.

We have witnessed a few Bills coming through the place that really should not be coming through it.  They do not amount to good legislation.  One of them is obviously the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  We had five different sessions on it and I think it will make things worse rather than better.  Recently, we also had a Bill on sexual offences which does not really stack up and there is not much rationale behind it.  It provided judges with an out in the context that they ignore it if they feel like it, which renders the legislation useless.  I do not see the point of introducing legislation like that.<\/p>  <p>  I followed the debate when the Bill was introduced and I noticed that amendments are due to be introduced.  It would have been good to see what they are.  We are talking about a Bill where the amendments could change it pretty dramatically, or maybe they will not, but we do not know.  I would like to see them.  Concern was raised about people ending up out of work because of the Bill.  I do not want to put anyone out of work either.  While I may be reading it wrong, some of the very large organisations that engage in ticket selling are obviously the ones that employ most people.<\/p><p>Are we going to jig this around in such a way as to leave them alone?  Will we just hit the smaller entities?  We are either going to control the price of tickets or we are not.

I do not think this Bill is workable, for a number of reasons.<\/p> <p> I seriously do not like paying over the odds for a ticket.  I really do not like it.  I could write a book about buying tickets.  I have been to nine World Cups and I usually go from start to finish, and the same with European Championships.  I have attended nine European Championships and been at nearly 30 Champion's League finals.  Most of the time I have gone without tickets and have bought them outside the stadia but I do not like getting charged over the odds.  I remember going to a Champion's League final in 1992.  The game, between Sampdoria and Barcelona, was in Wembley Stadium.  Barcelona won one-nil.  The goal was scored in the 87th minute by Ronald Koeman from a direct free kick.  I was shouting for the Italians.  It was Sampdoria's first excursion to the final.

Liam Brady played there for a while.  Anyway, myself and four other fellas went to the match but we had no tickets.

We thought that it would be difficult but the selling goes on in the same way as it does here, even though it is illegal.  The cops were around, watching to see if people were buying tickets.  There were five of us and I was the one who was going to do the bartering.  I was probably the shyest of the five but I was good at buying tickets.  Deputies should have seen the other four.  The tickets cost &pound;20 each.  I got five tickets for &pound;30 each, meaning that we paid 50% more or &pound;10 above the odds for each ticket.  No sooner did I get the tickets into my possession than a policeman came over and took them off me.  I was not impressed because there was no way I was going to be able to get more tickets.  First, we did not have any more money.  We were in a Hiace van and were sleeping in it for the night.

When he took the tickets from me I pleaded with him.  I told him that we had just come over from Ireland for the match and asked him to give them back to me.  He said no because it was illegal.  In the end, I had to cry to get the tickets back.  I cried my eyes out but at least he gave them back to me.  It worked and he gave them back and I was actually glad that it was possible to buy tickets, even if they were &pound;10 too much.  If it had been impossible to buy tickets there, I would not have been to the game.  If it was totally impossible to sell the tickets for more than &pound;20, I would not have gotten in to the match.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of inflation, I was at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986.  I went to 16 matches out there and I bought tickets outside the grounds for most of them.  We were staying in a hotel in the middle of Mexico City for $1 per night.  It was actually a nice place.  The prices were pretty low at the time and the tickets for the games were priced at around &pound;4.  We got tickets outside every ground right up to the quarter final.  The stadiums were pretty full.  The Azteca is the one in Mexico City and it holds 114,580, all sitting down.  It is the finest stadium on the planet; it is amazing.  There is an English language newspaper printed in Mexico and it was advertising tickets for the quarter finals, the semi-final and final.  The advertisement said \"reasonable\" prices so we decided to check it out because we thought it might be harder to get tickets outside the grounds.  We were getting cold feet, even though we had been successful up until then.  We decided to go along and see what it was like.  We went to the address on the advertisement, which was a hotel with about 30 floors.  It was the finest hotel in Mexico City.  When we went in we saw lots of big FIFA banners and realised that it was actually the FIFA hotel.  The touts were American.  We asked where the tickets were for sale and were told it was in room 372.  We got into the lift and went up to room 372 and could not believe the tickets that were in there.  Now, FIFA is rotten to the core but hat is hardly news to anyone here.  The tickets were literally being sold by members of FIFA to these touts at a profit and they were obviously making money on them too.

As pointed out by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, there is serious extortion on the face value of tickets.  Maybe we should do something about that.<\/p> <p> This legislation will not achieve what it says on the tin because the guy who is selling rugby tickets for &euro;500 each for Irish games will sell the tickets at face value and give a lunch voucher with them and charge through the nose for the lunch.  Also, where a person applies to a company for two tickets for a rugby match and the company selling them wants to charge &euro;1,000 for the pair even though the original price per ticket was &euro;120 the seller will put a pen in with the tickets and charge a crazy price for the pen and face value for the tickets.

Does the Government believe that if we make it illegal to charge over the face value for a ticket it will stop it happening?  I do not.  They never sold as much whiskey in America as they did when they made it illegal.  Sales went through the roof.  It was illegal but sales were magnificent.  I believe in legalising the drugs trade.  I think it is nuts that it is illegal to sell drugs in this town and yet every Tom, Dick and Harry can get them.  It is the easiest thing in the world to get them even though it is illegal.  I know a young fella who was sick as a dog last weekend.  He bought hash and it was badly contaminated by some other substance and it almost poisoned him.  We should regulate the drugs industry.  We should legalise and tax the sale and import of drugs and bring it under the umbrella of Government.  We sell alcohol.  There is hardly a day goes by that I do not have a drink so I have no problem with alcohol.  I have not heard a good argument as to why we continue to make the sale of drugs illegal.  By regulating the industry, we could control the quality of the drugs and stop people selling inferior or contaminated products and we could impose high taxes on them, in the same way as we do on cigarettes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400038#PP02900","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550161200,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1550161200,"counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400039#QQ00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Products Supply","time":1550161200,"counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400039#QQ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1550161200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>It was with great concern I received telephone calls in regard to the provision of incontinence pads to older people by the HSE.

These people should not have always to fight for basic things to be done right.  Unfortunately, people do have to fight constantly to get basic services.

As I said, it should never have happened.<\/p>  <p>  When I raised the issue with the HSE, it responded that following a national tender process Freightspeed was the successful bidder and awarded the contract for the delivery of incontinence wear and that while it has encountered some issues around supply it is working hard with Freightspeed to improve the situation.  National procurement discounts local deliveries, local suppliers, the people we rely on and the people who care.  When are we going to back to a system of procurement that is based not only on price but on service and reputation?  I suggest that these contracts should be tendered for locally not nationally because regular, reliable local suppliers are being pushed out by the big people who do not have the same attention to the individuals as was there in the past.<\/p><p>Any of us facing the same situation involving faulty delivery as that facing people in the west of Ireland would ask that we put people ahead of the god of this procurement process that just seems to make a shambles of procurement from the highest level with the over-runs on the children's hospital right down to just delivering a few incontinence pads in time, on time and all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400039#QQ00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550161800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health.

There have been some issues relating to the timely delivery of products under the new contract.  In 2018, the HSE put measures in place, including additional staff, an electronic management system and training of drivers to address initial difficulties.  The HSE has informed the Minister for Health that it is continuing to work closely with the contracted delivery partners to ensure that the problems experienced by some service users in the CHO west region and other CHO areas are addressed as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  A governance structure has been put in place to oversee the national contract for the supply and delivery of incontinence products to ensure the timely delivery of these products to eligible persons in their homes across all CHOs.

To support this process, additional administration staff have been put in place to carry out this work.

If the Government has made any savings by doing it on a national basis rather than continuing the old local tendering we used to have, the HSE has had to employ even more staff to monitor and try to get this right.  As the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  What we seem hell-bent on doing in this country is breaking everything and creating a central inefficient supply chain that does not work in the name of some savings that never materialise.

It is not just about competition on the visible price but competition on the real price of people getting what they need on time and in time.<\/p>  <p>  As the final insult, and I accept the Minister of State was given her speech, her speech states that \"in the mean time, service users should let their local public health nursing service or health centre know if they are experiencing difficulties with supply of products.\"  We are talking about the families of service users, who are already hugely burdened with problems, having to put right what they should not have to put right.

When my mother was so ill at home, the local service made life easier for all of us when we were looking after her.  It involves simple basic things like incontinence pads and other medical equipment that will help people stay at home and help their carers and families to give them the care they need at home.  I did not decide that there would be a process for this.  I believe that at some stage, we must look at local care and connect that through our primary care centres.

It has come about from engagement some of us have had with people from Bahrain and human rights organisations.  It is also topical today because 14 February is the eighth anniversary of the pro-democracy movement that took place in Bahrain along with many other countries in the Middle East.  In the eight years since then, we have seen the repression of the movement.  What is the fear around democracy and democratic movements?  When we look at the world, we can see that it is those countries with free democratic elections and the peaceful transfer of power after elections that have stability, growth, health and education.<\/p>  <p>  Bahrain has seen the horrific repression of a democratic movement.  It involves the repression of the protesters, be they lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, human rights defenders and members of civil society.  The repression continues today with torture, police and military brutality and forced disappearance.  I want to look in particular at the treatment of prisoners.  The are inhumane conditions in Juw Prison and Isa Town Female Detention Center.  Both prisons violate the UN standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners.  As well as the inhumane physical conditions, there are concerns over access to medication for prisoners, family visits, degrading searches and above all, the lack of accountability.  I want to mention three women prisoners in particular: Hajer Mansoor, Medina Ali and Najah Ahmed Yusuf, all of whom are in need of medical care.

I and my party are growing increasingly concerned about the repression of civil and political society in Bahrain.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, this is the eighth anniversary of the violent suppression by the Bahraini Government of the peaceful pro-democracy movement in Bahrain.  In the eight years since the crackdown, the situation has worsened, with numerous adverse developments in the past year alone.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will know it has been reported that the Bahraini Government is engaged in a campaign to repress political, civil and human rights and has taken steps to curb fundamental freedoms, including the right of freedom of expression, free assembly and a free press, among others.  In 2017, authorities in Bahrain shut down the country's only independent newspaper and the leading secular left opposition political society.  Just this month, the Supreme Court of Bahrain sentenced Sheikh Ali Salman, secretary general of the dissolved Al Wefaq political society, and senior Al Wefaq members, Sheikh Hassan Sultan and Ali Aswad, to life imprisonment.  Following the sentencing, the spokesperson for the EU said: \"Today&rsquo;s final verdict marks a further step against dissenting voices and undermines the residual chances for an inclusive political dialogue in the Kingdom of Bahrain.\"  The elections in Bahrain in 2018 were neither fair nor free, and human rights defenders and those who have expressed criticism of government policy have been arrested, tortured, interrogated and held in arbitrary detention.<\/p>  <p>  Given the current situation in Bahrain, it is ironic, to say the least, that Bahrain has a seat on the UN Human Rights Council and will do so until its term expires in 2021.  The Human Rights Council is an intergovernmental body within the United Nations system and is responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe, and for addressing human rights violations and making recommendations on them.  One wonders how the council can effectively carry out its functions when one of its members is actively and deliberately suppressing human rights.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Government to show leadership on this issue.  The 40th session of the Human Rights Council takes place from 25 February to 22 March.  I urge the Government to use this as an opportunity to express our grave concerns and to issue a statement condemning the actions of the Bahraini authorities ahead of the next session of the Human Rights Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400041#SS00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1550162400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  It is, of course, a matter of grave concern for the Government that, eight years on from the beginning of the 2011 pro-democracy protests, Bahrain has not progressed in the way we had hoped.  In fact, it has become an increasingly restrictive society, civic society space has contracted significantly and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and association, are violated with worrying frequency.  There are reports that the elections of last November took place in an environment that stifled dissent, and recent reports of torture and other inhumane and degrading treatment in regard to detained persons are especially distressing.  We urge all states to safeguard the rights of prisoners and detainees, and our voice has been prominent in highlighting this particular thematic issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is engaging with the Government of Bahrain, and this includes with its embassy in London, on a range of issues, including the ones I have outlined.  Given the long-standing bilateral links between Ireland and Bahrain, for example, on the training of medical personnel, raising Ireland's concerns about human rights and freedom of expression in Bahrain is a prominent part of the dialogue we have on an ongoing basis.  The Bahraini Government has given repeated commitments that it is taking action to improve the human rights situation and to safeguard rights which are enshrined in its constitution.  However, the facts are very clear and the facts on the ground show that it has yet to live up to those commitments.  I take this opportunity again to call on the Bahraini Government to follow through on its obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies have raised many issues of concern, in particular in regard to specific people who have been detained.  I am aware there is particular consciousness of Sheikh Ali Salman, secretary general of what was once Bahrain's largest opposition political party, who was sentenced to life in prison in November of last year.  This is something we are monitoring and are extremely concerned about, particularly in regard to Sheikh Ali Salman's trial but also other trials in recent times.<\/p>  <p>  Protection of fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression and opinion, is a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade receives regular reports from NGOs on the situation in Bahrain.  As a small country, Ireland amplifies its voice on human rights issues through multilateral engagement and measured recommendations offered as part of constructive dialogue.  We continually advocate in favour of a free and fair democratic process and for the right of civil society actors and human rights defenders to operate in a safe environment, but also without fear of reprisals for speaking out.  Ireland also urges all states to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees, and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Niall Collins raised the issue of the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland has always used the Human Rights Council as a means of keeping human rights issues in Bahrain under examination.  We have raised Bahrain in the past eight statements on human rights situations that require the council's attention and I assure the Deputies we will raise the matter again in the upcoming meeting.  We have expressed concern about the restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders in Bahrain, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression and the right to a fair trial.  At the Human Rights Council in June last year, the statement by the European Union also highlighted the deterioration of the human rights situation in Bahrain, with particular reference to the shrinking of political space.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade constantly monitors developments in regard to human rights in Bahrain and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to making progress in all of these areas of human rights.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that we have positive bilateral relations with Bahrain, which is home to some 800 Irish citizens, but this does not prevent us from raising the concerns through the appropriate channels, whether it is directly with Bahraini officials or at an international level with our colleagues throughout the European Union and, of course, at the UN Human Rights Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400041#SS00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1550162400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>There has been documented police brutality yet no senior officials in Bahrain's security forces have been held accountable for allegations of torture, excessive force or extrajudicial killings to date.

I reassure both Deputies that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to raise our voice about the human rights situation both multilaterally and through various organisations.  We co-sponsored the UN Human Rights Council resolutions calling on states to investigate alleged human rights violations.  That is abuse suffered by detainees and in particular where there is death, torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, as well as to ensure there is proper investigation which provides effective remedies to victims, as Deputy Niall Collins has raised.

I am beginning to feel a little bit like a broken record, but that is because the system is still broken and we are trying to fix it.  I ask the Minister for his assistance today with that and with expediting some solutions.  It has been well documented, not least in our debates, where the problems are.<\/p>  <p>  The first debate I had in the Chamber was with the Minister, Deputy Ross, on transport issues but the problems go back further back than the arrival of either of us in the House.  The problems have worsened.  In part, that is a due to the success of the improved service on the Newbridge line, serving Sallins and Hazelhatch.  The stations of Sallins and Hazelhatch are now in the Leap card short-hop zone and the trains go through the Phoenix Park tunnel.  That is all very welcome.  I came in on that train this morning and I will return on it in about an hour's time tonight.  The problem, however, is that the capacity of facilities has not kept pace.  Naturally, increased demand has followed the improvements.  We welcome the growing economy and other reasons for people being back on the trains again but we have a chronic shortage of car parking in particular.  The carriages are full as well.  Just before I rose to my feet I got a report that the 5.30 p.m. train leaving Heuston Station this evening is chronically congested again but even getting a space in the morning to park one's car in the morning so one can get on the train has become almost impossible.  In my case, it is probably a year since I have been able to get my car into the station in the mornings.  Many people are finding the same difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  One needs to be at the car park of the Sallins and Naas train station between 7 a.m. and 7.15 a.m. at the latest to have any hope of being able to park one's car and get on the train.  That is a crying shame for many reasons.  It is highly stressful for the individuals involved who are trying to juggle childcare, getting to work and other commitments and it is made more difficult by having to fight for a space that it is almost impossible to get at such an early time.  It is a shame for society that people are being forced away from public transport.  We all support the goal of improved public transport and public transport being the primary mode of transport.  I would love to see a situation where the car would become the exception, other than for a trip on a Sunday afternoon, and the norm for going to work was on the train or Luas.  However, unless we can provide people with the facilities and space to park a car in the first place and enough room on the train to stand, sit or manage to squeeze on then we are nowhere near getting there.<\/p>  <p>  This situation was entirely predictable.  We only need to look at the planning permissions being granted for houses in the Naas, Sallins and Clane area, which has grown and is growing.  There are many developments there as there is much to recommend the area.  It was entirely predictable that those demands would be placed on the train service because the train station is at the heart of the community and it is a commuter hub.  All the planning permissions were granted on the basis of public transport being available to the area but, essentially, it is no longer available and people are being forced into their cars to drive into Dublin.  People are fighting with each other in the mornings over available spaces and they are being forced into local housing estates, thereby clogging up the entire village and causing all kinds of acrimony.  In recent weeks Irish Rail had to appoint a staff member to police the car park in the mornings and to avoid the literal, as well as the metaphorical, scrapes because the situation has reached a crisis point.  People have nowhere to park and they cannot get the train into Dublin in the morning.  They bought a house on the promise of a public transport system being in place in the Sallins, Naas and Clane areas in north Kildare and they are unable to use it because they simply cannot get a car parking space in the morning.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister can expedite some solutions.  The obvious solution is to build a new car park fast but I accept it is not as simple as that.  There may be other solutions.  I hope the Minister will have some good news for me today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400042#TT00300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1550163000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawless for raising this issue.

The increases have been made possible through the improved level of services provided through increased public service obligation, PSO, funding, as well as the increased levels of capital expenditure on projects such as the completed Phoenix Park tunnel and the ongoing city centre resignalling project.<\/p>  <p>  I have a script which I will provide to Deputy Lawless.  I apologise, as I should have given it to him earlier.  It might be helpful to him.  I am happy to say that we are providing further increases to funding as part of Project Ireland 2040, which will further improve capacity on the Kildare line.  The improvements include the DART expansion programme and the improved management of the overall network, which the new national train control centre will provide.<\/p>  <p>  However, I recognise that in the short term, there are of course pressures across the network at certain places and at certain times.  Car parking at Sallins is one of those pressure points.  The pressures have increased with the expanded and improved level of service, as well as the inclusion of the station within the short-hop zone.  Together, they have all led to increased demand, on what I know is a relatively limited amount of car parking at the station.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, my Department provides funding through the NTA for car parking at train stations in the greater Dublin area, GDA.  I can inform the Deputy that there is a project under development to significantly extend the number of car parking spaces available at the station.  On foot of the funding provided through the NTA, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been preparing the detailed planning and design and will take the lead on implementation.

I ask the Minister to join me and to apply what pressure he can in order to bring to matters to a head and prioritise the works necessary to get that over the line.  There is a plan in motion.  There have been some technical and planning difficulties, but it is important to get all the relevant people around the table.  I am doing everything I can and I ask the Minister to do the same in his Department to encourage the parties to resolve outstanding issues and move this forward.<\/p> <p> There are other potential solutions that can be explored.  Along with Hazelhatch and Celbridge Station, Sallins and Naas Station came into the short-hop zone approximately two years ago.  There are still commuters from Newbridge, Kildare town and further out, and possibly even Monasterevin, who actually drive past their local station.  They drive from the south of the county to park at Sallins and Naas Station because it is in the short-hop zone and they can avail of the cheaper fares.  It does not really make sense from several perspectives, not least that of climate change.  More emissions are produced by people driving farther to get to the station.  It also does not make sense logically or with regard to practical convenience and comfort.  People do not want to drive past their local station in order to get to another station, but their budgets decree that they must.  I ask the Minister to talk to the NTA about extending the short-hop zone to Newbridge and possibly beyond.  That will remove some of the pressure.<\/p> <p> I wish to put another suggestion to the Minister, and I would like him to explore it with the NTA and other stakeholders.  There is a system of feeder buses serving some of these stations, including Sallins and Naas Station and Hazelhatch and Celbridge Station.  The feeder bus makes a lot of sense.  People from the surrounding towns and estates from three to five miles away, places that are too far away to walk from, can travel to the station by bus.  This is already happening in Naas, but there are not enough buses and the routes are not comprehensive enough.  With a small improvement that would fit very well into public policy, we could expand the feeder bus network to cover the likes of Clane, Caragh, Sallins and Naas and bring people to the stations without ever having to step into their car.

Anyone who has been out in any scenic area of the city or the country, be it near a canal or a river, in a park or on a beach, will be acutely aware of the blight on the landscape that plastic waste can often pose.  We pride ourselves on Ireland being a green country and a beacon for tourists, and, indeed, an increasingly environmental country.  It is my belief that the Minister and I, and all Members of this House, would consider ourselves green with a small \"g\" or environmental with a small \"e\".  Accordingly, the idea of a deposit and rebate scheme for plastic bottles tends to carry the support of the vast majority of the Irish public according to all the polling and opinion pieces I have seen.  More than 90% of the people I talk to are in favour of such a scheme.  In a 2017 Bill, the Green Party effectively set out a deposit-and-return scheme which has been somewhat tacitly accepted by many in the House but has been subject to delays.  In 2018, the Oireachtas Library and Research Service put together a publication outlining the potential costs of implementing such a scheme and its potential benefits.  The benefits seem to be myriad.  They include increasing the rate of plastic bottle recycling - by only 3%, granted, but that is an increase nevertheless - and a cleaner environment.  I am not sure we can put a price on that.  It is accepted that implementation would involve a cost, but, equally, it would bring great benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I am seeking an update on the Minister's progress and perhaps his thinking in this regard.  The most recent media reports suggest he has gone back to look at this afresh.  Obviously, we have had a change of Minister in this portfolio in recent months.  I am curious, as I am sure the public is, to hear where the Minister's thinking with regard to this matter currently is.  Can he give a commitment on this?  I am conscious of the day that is in it.  According to the Minister's Instagram, he is a keen baker and cook.  I imagine he is keen to get home to his dinner on St. Valentine's Day, so I will not keep him much longer, except to end with an appropriate St. Valentine's Day poem, if the Acting Chairman will permit me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400043#UU00600","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1550163600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Do I have a choice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400043#UU00700","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1550163600,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I will proceed.<\/p><blockquote>Roses are red, Ireland is green,<br \/><br \/>A plastic bottle rebate will keep our streets clean.<\/blockquote><p>I imagine the Minister will agree with this and I am curious to hear his opinions on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400043#UU00800","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1550163600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>It is with great relief that we greet the Deputy's poem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400043#UU00900","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1550163600,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I did not manage to catch the rhyming scheme or the scanning of that line.

I recently commissioned a study to establish whether a deposit-and-return scheme would be a cost-effective measure in terms of achieving the goal on which we all agree, namely, reducing the levels of plastic pollution and improving our recycling targets.  I am very keen to see an effective response to the problem of plastic use in Ireland.  The figures suggest that use of plastic in packaging in Ireland is nearly 80% higher than in other European countries.  The scale presents us with a problem.  We need to think not only of recovery schemes, but also reduction schemes.  As the Deputy probably knows, one of the first things I did was introduce a ban on the use of single-use plastics across the public service.  That has come into effect immediately within Departments and will be rolled out across the public service in March.  This will prevent any further acquisition of single-use plastics, although current stocks will continue to run down.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty with the deposit-and-return scheme was outlined by my predecessor.  We have a kerbside collection scheme which is meeting pretty high targets, achieving approximately 70% recovery of plastic bottles.  We have agreed to a higher target of 90%.  We need to see if this is a cost-effective measure before we make it a legal obligation.  The Deputy rightly cites public opinion as an important indicator of the direction of policy thinking.  However, introducing a legal obligation would give rise to the cost implications and so on of legal enforcement and actions against businesses.  I am conscious that many small businesses informed the committee that the cost of this would be very significant.<\/p><p> The point my predecessor, Deputy Naughten, made is also valid in that if one of the more valuable recovery streams is taken out of the curbside collection, namely, plastic bottles, there is the risk that an additional cost on households would be created and we would see an increase in charges for households.  To decide in a robust way based on evidence, I have taken the step of commissioning work on this so that we can establish, first, if it is cost effective and, second, how we should design it.  That invitation to tender has been published and is available if the Deputy is interested in seeing it.<\/p> <p> We need to bear in mind also that we have very ambitious recycling targets for plastic generally.  We are at less than 35% across the entire plastic packaging spectrum.  We need to get to 50% by 2025 and 55% by 2030.  There are a number of things we need to consider to make that a reality.  There is far too much mixed materials going into the plastic packaging stream that cannot be recycled and we need to address that.  I am looking at how we can improve the current producer obligation scheme to ensure there is less plastic going into the waste stream and that what does go in is more recyclable.  I am looking through the supply chain to come up with initiatives that would be cost effective but I have by no means ruled out the deposit return scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400043#UU01200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550164200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Deputy Rock has time for a haiku.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400044#VV00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1550164200,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I did pen a rhyming couplet for the end so hopefully we will get this one on the record and the Minster can hear it.

I was delighted to see he launched the single use plastics ban in the Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun, in my constituency, which is doing fantastic work in teaching people about both the inputs and the outputs and the impact on environmentalism.  The Minister is absolutely right in what he says in that regard.<\/p><p>However, in terms of the waste providers and the practicalities of how current schemes work, it would strike me, and I imagine it would strike the Minister and the public, that in the instance where I buy a bottle of water or a bottle of Coca Cola, generally speaking, I do not bring the bottle home with me.  There is no real incentive for me to recycle that.  I would likely dispose of it in a public waste facility.  There is no prospect of it being recycled.  In other cities I visit, if I buy a product in a convenience store I can dispose of the bottle or the packaging in that convenience store.  The existing waste providers do not like that.  They argue that curbside collection costs might increase, and they might well increase, but in terms of practicalities, if I consume a product in the outside world and do not have an opportunity to bring it home with me there is no prospect of it being recycled.  Similarly, the existing waste collectors do not pick up bottles, etc., on the road so there is no incentive currently to do so.

I will come back to the language but it is a straightforward Bill with seven sections.  The first section under the heading \"Definition\" simply sets out that the principal Act is the 1893 Act and section 7, as is usual in any Bill, sets out the Short Title and collective citation.  In between there are five short sections, 2 to 6, inclusive, which is the substantive part of the Bill.  These sections seek to amend the main Act in a very practical and sensible way so as to ease the formation and the functioning of co-operatives on the ground.  That is bun agus barr an sc&eacute;al anseo chun &eacute; a &eacute;asc&uacute; do chomharchumainn ar fud na t&iacute;re agus ar na hoile&aacute;in ionas go mbeidh s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os &eacute;asca comharchumann a eagr&uacute; agus a chur chun cinn.<\/p>  <p>  There is no denying that the primary legislation, notwithstanding subsequent and various amendments up to 2014, is not fit for purpose.  It is outdated with many of the provisions within the legislation pre-dating the birth of the Irish State and thus no longer relevant.  Some of the provisions in the 1893 Act refer, for example, to how the law is to apply in Scotland and the Channel Islands.  Other sections refer to feudal tenure while others refer to insane and lunatic members.  The irony, which I will come back to, is that the Act itself no longer applies in England, which changed its Act in 2014.  It is ironic that we are still working under this Act.<\/p><p>To be fair to the Department and the Government, in recognition of this, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation initiated a welcome review of the Act.  As part of that review it invited submissions.  In the event, ten written submissions were made to the Department although I am subject to correction on that figure, but unfortunately nothing appears to have happened in the intervening period and no review report has been published to date.  Given that vacuum and given the real obstacles posed by the existing, outdated legislation on the formation of co-operatives and-or their operation on the ground, Independents 4 Change has brought this very short Bill before the House and I anticipate the support of all parties, including the Government.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, introduced the Bill on First Stage on 3 July 2018, just over six months ago, with the support of all parties and Independents, and given the brevity and importance of the Bill, I hope that it will go through the House very quickly.  In essence, the amendments proposed in the substance of the very short Bill, from sections 2 to 6, seek to make the process of registering and running a co-operative much easier, in the first instance, by reducing the membership requirement which currently stands at seven to three members.  This is provided for in sections 2(1) and 2(2) along with provision set out at section 3 for what will happen in the event of the number falling below three.  The Bill also allows for audit exemptions in certain situations and this is set out in sections 4 and 5.  Section 6 allows for the use of electronic communication with regard to the registration of co-operatives and also for specified other documents which are required to be lodged with the Registry of Friendly Societies.  It is important to highlight that what is sought in the proposed changes are mechanisms which are already available under company law but not for co-operatives.  What we are seeking here is simple, namely a basic parity with what exists for small companies such as the exemptions for audits, the electronic filing and the ability to function with one director.  We are simply looking for some parity on that practical stuff.<\/p> <p> It is also important to highlight that what is sought in the proposed amendments emerged as a common theme in the submissions as part of the review that the Department set up.  On that, I thank publicly those who made the submissions.  I read most of them and they were very helpful to me and my colleagues in this, in particular the Society for Co-operative Studies in Ireland, Co-operative Housing Ireland and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Limited.  They took great pains to make written submissions in much more detail than I am doing.  They highlighted many problems with the antiquated legislation but the common theme, among many others, was around the basic amendments we are seeking here.<\/p> <p> I am not sure what attitude the Government is taking on it but for me it is straightforward and simple legislation.  Quite clearly, more comprehensive legislation is also required.  I am asking for something that will enable co-operatives to function much more easily in the meantime.  When one looks at the Act, it is so outdated.  The word co-operative does not exist in it.  It is the Industrial Provident and Societies Act 1893 and of course we have amended it up to 2004.  One would be hard pushed to find the word co-operative in it and one would really be hard pushed to understand it at this point because it is so antiquated.  As I said, it is extraordinary that it no longer applies in England and the UK Government amended its legislation in 2014.  In fact, under that it created a community benefit society to offer a distinct set of legal provisions for those co-operatives that are serving their communities.  There are many issues on a broader scale with co-operatives such as those that are non-profit and those that are making a profit but to make the passage of the Bill easier at this point, we have taken the most basic changes as a starting point.  There is a great need for consolidated legislation to cover all of the other issues raised in the submissions.<\/p> <p> It is also of interest that in Europe, various countries have dealt with this in different ways.  For example, in Greece, Italy and Malta there is support for co-operatives in their constitutions.  They have gone that far to enshrine it in their constitutions while in other more northern and Nordic countries, the approach they took was to help co-operatives in the form of faoiseamh c&aacute;nach, a relief under taxation.  The EU itself has recognised the distinctive contributions of the co-operative model through the creation of the European Cooperative Society.  In Scotland, I understand the legislation is particularly suited for co-operatives.  It is difficult to come up with up to date research on this matter but what has emerged from Scotland is that those enterprises set up through the co-operative model have a high rate of success compared with private companies.<\/p> <p> Of course in Ireland we know we have a long history and it would be wrong to stand here and speak about co-operatives without mentioning Horace Plunkett at the end of the nineteenth century who was to the fore in setting up the agricultural co-operatives.  It would be wrong not to mention the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Pringle, and Glencolumbkille and Fr. McDyer and the tremendous and Trojan work he did along with the community there.  It was throughout all of Ireland and tagra&iacute;m do na comharchumainn uilig, Comharchumann Forbartha &Aacute;rann i mo cheantar san &aacute;ireamh.

As Chairman of the Committee on the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, I have travelled and we are still travelling to visit every Gaeltacht in the country.  There are many common themes but the most important one that jumps out is the work of co-operatives on the ground throughout all of the Gaeltacht areas and on the islands.<\/p> <p> I mention the distinguishing features of co-operatives.  This is a theme that has emerged through all of the submissions.  Some of the submissions look for the seven defining features of co-operatives to be incorporated in any future legislation and if not actually incorporated in the legislation, that they would be the guiding force in any legislation on the ground on co-operatives.  The distinguishing features identified over and over are the voluntary and open membership, democratic member control, member economic participation, autonomy and independence, education, training and information, co-operation among co-operatives and concern for the community.  People have different experiences of co-operatives such as the very successful agricultural ones, particularly in the south of the country and we also have the credit unions as a good example of co-operatives.  My experience is on the comharchumainn ar an talamh sna ceantair tuaithe agus ar na hoile&aacute;in.  It would seem to me from what I have seen on the ground that the value for money achieved by their work for every euro invested is far higher than the value achieved with money invested in other companies.  I am not seeking to distinguish because we obviously need companies but we are asking that we get consolidation of all the existing legislation as soon as possible.  Update it and make it fit for purpose in the twenty-first century with a clear statement on co-operatives and then following on from that, bring in an education programme highlighting the importance of co-operatives, the value of same and what they are doing for the communities, for social enterprise and in making profit also.<\/p> <p> It is so short that there is no need to say any more on this matter.  Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate at an early stage whether the Government is supporting it.  I can see no reason why it would not.  There are no implications for the public purse and in the absence of anything being done following the review, we are asking for the most basic changes at this point.  Not only are we asking for it as Independents 4 Change but all of the submissions have asked for it and we have picked out the common themes to take action now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400044#VV00800","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550164800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Before I bring in the Minister of State, Deputy English, I want to confirm and agree the schedule of speakers.

The Minister is sorry that she is unable to attend the debate and I will outline her views for the Deputies.  However, she will be happy to engage with Members at a later stage as we bring forward changes in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister; the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, and the Department are acutely aware of the continuing importance of the co-operative movement throughout Ireland, particularly to local and rural communities.  Anybody who has been involved in politics or with a community will be aware of the benefit it brings.  I was previously Chairman of the Oireachtas committee which brought forward the changes to the Companies Act and even at that stage we had a discussion on the importance of co-operatives.  However, while the Minister is sympathetic to the well intended objectives of the Bill, she cannot support it in its current form and I will outline why.<\/p>  <p>  Following the drafting and passage of the Companies Act 2014 which had been a priority for the Government and which now forms the basis of Ireland&rsquo;s business regulatory environment, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has turned its attention to the review of the industrial and provident societies legislation.  The Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2014 provide the statutory regulatory basis in Ireland for the formation and general operation of industrial and provident societies which are primarily co-operatives.  After various piecemeal amendments introduced over more than 120 years, most recently in 2018, the Minister believes it is time to conduct a wholehearted review of what is a largely Victorian statutory code.  Deputy Connolly voiced a similar desire.  The purpose of the comprehensive review is not only to consolidate and modernise the existing legislation but also to ensure an effective legislative framework suitable for the diverse range of organisations using the co-operative model in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the root and branch review, the Department has conducted a public consultation process on the operation and implementation of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2014.  Deputy Connolly referred to it and said it was a worthwhile review.  The results of the consultation process were published on the Department's website in April 2018.  The submissions highlighted the need for consideration of a wide range of issues, including providing co-operative societies with a distinct legislative identity, reflecting the co-operative ethos, reducing the minimum number of members, facilitating electronic filing and introducing audit exemptions in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 of the Bill proposes to reduce the number of members as a condition of the registration of industrial and provident societies.  While a number of submissions to the Department have suggested a reduction in the minimum number of members, there was no consensus on what the minimum number should be.  The Minister fully recognises the importance of creating favourable conditions for encouraging a range of start-ups, including co-operatives.  However, she is of the view that this issue requires careful consideration and that further analysis is needed to ensure any proposed change does not have unintended consequences.  For example, one of the issues that must be considered is ensuring the reduction in the minimum number of members does not act as an impediment to the establishment of viable and sustainable co-operatives with members who have the necessary skills to run these entities.  Different approaches have been taken across Europe to the minimum number of members to form a co-operative, ranging from one in Finland to ten in Poland.  As part of the legislative review, the Department will explore the various policy options for the optimum minimum number of members required to form a co-operative.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is also cognisant of new EU anti-money laundering directives that are due to be implemented shortly in Ireland.  Every Irish company, apart from those listed in a regulated market, and industrial and provident society will be legally obliged to file its beneficial owner's details with the new register of beneficial ownership, RBO, within six months of it opening.  Failure to file within the six-month period can result in the company or industrial and provident society being fined and prosecuted.  Any person who holds or controls 25% or more of the shares or voting rights of a company or industrial and provident society, whether directly or indirectly, is a beneficial owner and required to be registered with the RBO.  Reducing the current minimum membership requirement for co-operatives may have unintended consequences for smaller co-operatives.  Again, it is important that we tease this out further and the Minister is happy to engage with Deputies on it.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Bill provides an enabling provision for the Minister to exempt, by regulations, specified classes of societies to file annual returns or certain specified classes of documents that would otherwise be required to be included as part of an annual return.  The Minister has serious reservations about this proposal.  The existing companies legislative framework does not provide for exemptions from filing annual returns, the exception being investment companies regulated by the Central Bank which must deliver financial statements to the Companies Registration Office, CRO.  The only total exemption from including financial statements with the annual return of a company applies to unlimited companies.<\/p>  <p>  The co-operatives that are formed and registered in Ireland are limited liability entities.  In return for the advantages of limited liability, the law requires them to disclose their financial statements to the public.  This is a very important protection for employees.  It is also an important protection for other entities doing business with them.  After all, these other entities have employees and suppliers of their own.  Without knowing the financial position of a co-operative, employees and others are asked to take a chance that a co-operative can pay wages or its bills.  The exemption, as proposed in the Bill, potentially undermines transparency and trust which are essential elements in the effective functioning of co-operative societies and underpin the co-operatives' principles of open membership and members' economic participation.  In the interests of co-operative members and the public interest the Minister cannot support this section of the Bill, as it stands.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that no response to the public consultation process requested exemptions from filing annual returns, as proposed in the Bill.  Some responses, however, requested the introduction of audit exemptions for co-operatives in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014.  This is an area that will be explored further in the comprehensive review.<\/p>  <p>  On the proposed provisions for registration and filing by electronic means which form the third element of the Bill, these are positive proposals with which the Minister agrees, but they have been overtaken by events.  As part of modernising the filing environment for the Registry of Friendly Societies, RFS, which includes co-operatives, on 6 December 2018, the Minister launched the RFS online facility.  The launch was attended by several co-operative stakeholders, which are now using the new IT system to register new entities online, file annual returns and amendments to the rules of their societies electronically, make online payments for filings and order documents online.  The fees for submitting applications to the RFS and filing documents were also reviewed in August 2018 to bring them into line with similar fee types used by the Companies Registration Office.  The regulations included a provision for a reduction in fees for documents filed online.  I am aware that the Bill was published last July prior to the reduction and that events have moved on since.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister wishes to avoid the introduction of more piecemeal and fragmented legislation in this important area.  She is also concerned about the introduction of measures that could reduce transparency.  She considers that a more appropriate course of action is to consolidate in one statute all existing industrial and provident societies legislation, modernise it to eliminate outdated provisions and align it with the realities of the 21st century business and regulatory environment, with which Deputy Connolly would agree.  I accept that the Deputy wanted to bring forward a smaller measure at first, but we all share the view that it is important to have consolidation in this area.  This will ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities and provide a conducive framework to allow the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised.<\/p>  <p>  For the reasons I have outlined, the Minister cannot support the Bill.  She proposes to take account of the wide range of views expressed in the public consultation process that has been undertaken, including what she recognises as genuine and well intended proposals outlined in the Bill, and bring forward comprehensive and reformed legislation in the area of industrial and provident societies later this year.  As I said, she is happy to engage with Deputies in the process of developing the new legislation.  When we brought forward the companies legislation previously, it benefited greatly from the co-operation and involvement of Members across the House in the committee and beforehand in fully engaging on it.  There was a great deal of work involved and it helped that there was that engagement.  The Minister will certainly be interested in working with Deputies as we approach the changes to be made in this area in the next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400046#XX00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1550165400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>This Bill is very important in simplifying the process of starting a co-operative in Ireland, which must happen.  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy English, said the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, would do this all of a sudden and that it would be done by the end of the year.  That is amazing, considering that the legislation has been in place since 1874.  Some 120 years later we will get to consolidate it.<\/p><p>That is indicative of the lack of importance that this and previous Governments have placed on co-operatives and their ability to contribute to our society.  Rather, they have focused entirely on foreign direct investment, FDI, and the development of multinationals, which run riot around the country accruing great benefit.  The schemes that would be of benefit to the citizens of this country and the places where they live have been put on the hind tit.  Those policies have led to our industrial profile not being developed to benefit the people of Ireland rather than the businesses that have moved here.<\/p> <p> Co-operatives are more developed and active in countries such as Germany than is the case here.  Such development is not something to be afraid of.  It would not communise Ireland - a prospect which I acknowledge would terrify Fine Gael.<\/p> <p> The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, brilliantly outlines on its website the principles of co-operatives, which make them of value.  It outlines that co-operatives are voluntary organisations open to all; that they are democratic organisations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions, with men and women serving as elected representatives accountable to the membership.  In primary co-operatives, members have equal voting rights - one member, one vote - while co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.  Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative.  Members allocate surpluses for the purposes of developing the co-operative, benefitting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative and supporting other activities approved by the membership.  Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members.  Emphasis is placed on education, training and information.  There is significant co-operation among co-operatives, which work together through local, national, regional and international structures.  Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities, which stands in stark contrast to how business currently operates in this country.  The multinationals exist to benefit their shareholders, of whom there are very few living and working here.  We do not have much to fear from organisations that apply those principles their core, although the multinational businesses which want everything in society to prioritise their profit needs may not wish for them to grow in stature.<\/p> <p> There is a long history of co-operative societies in rural Ireland.  The agricultural co-operatives that are now public limited companies may not have benefitted their members as much as they could or originally intended.  Co-ops in Donegal have survived over time.  Deputy Connolly referred to some of them.  The Glencolumbkille co-operative initiated by Fr. McDyer has fallen by the wayside but it provided hope for a significant time.  My father worked there as a manager in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  The most notable of co-operative is the Cope in Dungloe, which is still going today.  It started out as the Templecrone Co-Operative Agricultural Society in 1906 and retains many of the characteristics of a co-operative today.  Many co-operatives were created to meet a community need.  For example, the Comhar Cumann na Rosann Teo knitting co-operative established in the 1970s and which operated until recently was a much-needed resource for the women of the area.  It provided them with a means of creating income by selling their knitting and acted as a liaison to buyers in order to achieve a better prices for the produce, which is vitally important.  Indeed, it pissed off many people in the local community who were benefitting from the work of the women and did not want them to organise as a co-operative.  My mother was involved in that initiative through the Combat Poverty Agency, which did a significant amount of good work in terms of forming co-operatives in Donegal through the 1970s, of which this was a perfect example.  Fishermen&rsquo;s co-operatives were established in most coastal communities.  Many have become private companies or fallen by the wayside because it has been difficult to keep them going.<\/p> <p> This legislation might go some way to making co-operatives viable.  Governments past and present have intentionally made it difficult for economic models other than the dominant private sector profit-driven model, which has wreaked havoc in our country, to flourish.  The Bill is designed to amend the regulations relating to the establishment of co-operative societies in order to make the process of registering a co-operative far easier.  It reduces the membership criteria from seven members to three, in line with regulations in most European countries.  It allows for electronic filing and registration and audit exemptions, which are all available to other types of companies.  These small measures will level the playing field and make the establishment of co-operatives far easier, as well as bringing us more in line with the rest of Europe.<\/p> <p> We need to face the fact that our economic model must change if we are to address the issue of climate change and meet our international and domestic obligations in that regard.  The co-operative model can play a major role in facilitating that.  Co-operatives can facilitate a revolution in renewable energy.  Communities could own and manage their own renewable energy sources, bypassing the developer-led wind farm model which is greatly loved by Irish officialdom.  Citizen co-operatives in Germany have been investing in the production of renewable energies for many years.  Some are now considering how to buy the energy grid back from energy companies.  Co-operatives in Hamburg succeeded in doing so, creating a new business model that many countries would like to emulate.  Almost 40% of German renewable capacity is now locally owned, some by household domestic photovoltaic and some by local co-operatives, with hundreds of village and town-based schemes in place.  This model has been suggested as a new form of decentralised socio-economic power, whereby local social entrepreneurship challenges the existing market system.  The fact that there is local ownership and self-generation means that the existing developer-led utility companies are losing control of some parts of their market, which can only be good news for the people and the environment.<\/p> <p> The growth of co-operatives could be part of a solution to the decline of towns and villages in rural Ireland.  Residents could get together to form a co-operative and buy out the local pub, restaurant or butcher.  The possibilities are limitless but require the right amount of political will.  The Bill will enable co-operatives to become established and thrive.  A co-operative-led economy could uphold the principles of a just transition, where workers&rsquo; rights are upheld such that workers can live and work within their communities and sustainable local economies can thrive.  Workers&rsquo; rights would also be preserved through worker co-operatives, which are more resilient and productive than the alternative and provide greater benefits to workers and their communities.  The Bill would facilitate an increase in the development to the co-operative sector in line with the needs of communities across the country.  The co-operative model could be the perfect antidote to Fine Gael&rsquo;s corrosive policies, which are undermining rural Ireland and the needs of communities across the country.  If the Minister is serious about reforming the industrial and provident societies legislation, I ask her to provide a date for doing so.  Unfortunately, I do not believe the will is there to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400046#XX00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550166000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>The purpose of the Bill is to simplify the process of setting up and running co-operative societies.  It is short and sweet, comprising just seven sections.  It a small but important step in terms of what is needed to develop a larger co-operative sector in the economy.  It is probably safe to say that the Bill contributed to the decision of the Minister to launch the online offering of the Register of Friendly Societies on 6 December.  I would be pleased to have played a role in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should allow the Bill to progress to Committee Stage because the Industrial and Provident Societies Act it seeks to amend was introduced in 1893, as has been pointed out.  The Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act was passed in 2014.  Members are aware that the process in respect of co-operatives partially collapsed in 2002.<\/p>  <p>  Encouraging the development of co-operatives should be an important feature of developing the digital economy.  That is why it is important that the Bill move to Committee Stage in order to discuss it and work with the Minister, the Government and other parties to get it moving quickly.  Our economy is severely unbalanced and overdependent on foreign direct investment and very large transnational corporations.  Some 80% of corporation tax is now paid by a small number of major multinationals.  We cannot rely on that situation continuing, given the international pressure for reform of corporation tax laws in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also relates to the issues of jobs, regional development and a more balanced economy.  The Department's Enterprise 2025 strategy targets the creation of 266,000 new jobs by next year, including 75,000 jobs resulting directly from FDI and 65,000 indirectly.  FDI is being relied upon to create more than half the jobs targeted.  State agencies focus on FDI to too great a degree.  We need to refocus on developing local industry with an even regional base.<\/p><p>Co-operatives can play a key role, aided by a State investment bank and with advice and support from a designated State agency.  This means re-establishing the co-operative development unit that closed in 2002.  This unit was set up in 1998.  Between 1991 and 1992, co-operative enterprises increased in number from 47 to 73.  Between 1996 and 1998, there was another spike, with an increase from 66 to 82.  The unit had a relatively good success rate while it existed despite the absence of legislation on co-operatives.<br\/><br\/>The Public Banking Forum of Ireland has done very good research and has come up with very workable proposals for developing a not-for-profit co-operative banking system with a remit to invest in small regional enterprises.  This would make a good fit with a State programme to develop co-operative societies.<br\/><br\/>The International Labour Organization, of which Ireland is a member, has called on governments to provide policy and a legal environment conducive to the creation of workers' co-operatives.  It states governments should provide grants and develop partnerships with co-operatives.  That is what we are signed up to, and we should be moving much quicker in this regard.<br\/><br\/>We have a history of co-operatives dating back to the 19th century.  The credit union movement and the agricultural co-operatives are very successful examples.  However, we lag far behind by comparison with countries such as Italy, Spain and France.  In Italy, there are over 800,000 employee owners in co-operatives.  Emilia-Romagna is a prime example in that it has 8,000 co-operatives producing 40% of the area's GDP.  They play a key role in the economy.  <i>Per capita<\/i>income in the region is 25% above the overall Italian <i>per capita<\/i>figure and 36% above the EU average <i>per capita<\/i>.  The unemployment rate is lower and the inequality level is among the lowest in the European Union.  Spain has 275,000 people in worker co-operatives.  The Mondragon Corporation co-operative ranks around tenth in the top 300 global enterprises.  In France, the worker co-operative buy-out sector has saved 600,000 jobs and accounts for 10% of GDP today.<br\/><br\/>The encouragement and development of this area would be a big step forward in rebuilding our economy and creating greater regional development.  I ask the Minister of State to accept this Bill and not to oppose it.  I ask other parties to get involved.  I am aware that Sinn F&eacute;in has done work on co-operatives and the legislation, as I am sure have other parties. <br\/><br\/>We produced our Bill in July last year and hoped to have it on the agenda much sooner.  In saying that, I believe it could still play a very progressive part in the overall debate if allowed to proceed to Committee Stage.  It might actually spur the Government into introducing legislation to deal with this matter.  Co-operatives in Ireland could be very positive for our indigenous economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400047#YY00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550166600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  That it is being discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il gives us an opportunity to talk about the impact the co-operative movement has had on the country over many years, primarily through creameries and credit unions.  These represent two obvious areas where co-operatives have been very much part of commercial life over the years.  Anything that would incentivise the co-operative mindset and encourage people to come together collectively to address deficiencies in their communities or services or start with a concept is to be encouraged and welcomed.  From that perspective, the thrust of the Bill is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  There is an ongoing consultation process concerning legislative supports for co-operatives and how they function.  This Bill could feed into that through a robust pre-legislative scrutiny process involving all the stakeholders intimately involved in the co-operative movement.<\/p>  <p>  Co-operatives are for the benefit and participation of members and are based on membership loyalty.  These are the three cornerstones of the co-operative movement.  They have served this country exceptionally well.  One could argue there should have been a greater proliferation of co-operatives in other areas.  There have been quite a number of successes, however, primarily in agriculture and the credit area.  Some of the largest Irish companies operating internationally serve as examples.  Kerry Group was spawned from the co-operative movement in west Kerry.  Huge companies have been created out of the co-operative concept.  We should always try to ensure co-operatives are run in a way that is beneficial to their members while at the same time advancing the concepts of entrepreneurship and enterprise.  They should not be allowed to stagnate and should reinvest continuously.  They should not exist solely to serve the present membership but to work towards the development of services for the years ahead.  Sometimes co-operatives failed to be innovative beyond the original concept for which they were established.  We should try to encourage innovation in the context of the debate on the co-operative movement.<\/p>  <p>  Reference has been made to the Scandinavian countries, Germany and the Baltic states where there has been a strong history and tradition of co-operatives.  There is no doubt that they have benefited countries and economies over many years.  They have a role to play in developing services in certain areas of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Reference has been made to alternative energy.  One could argue that biomass and bio-digesters, for example, present opportunities for the coming together of communities and individuals in collective partnership, under a co-operative-type concept, to produce energy and afford associated benefits in the broader communities where the relevant infrastructure is located.  One could argue a co-operative concept with buy-in from a community is welcome.  If a co-operative is for the benefit and participation of its members, and is based on their loyalty, the concept of co-operation would be very much part of the ethos.<\/p>  <p>  In trying to encourage the co-operative movement, one has to accept that one cannot give an unfair advantage to one group over another, particularly in commerce and business.  Where there is limited liability for members of co-operatives by comparison with individuals involved in the same type of industry, business or enterprise elsewhere, the legislation must be fair, balanced and impartial to ensure no one has a significant advantage over another.  With regard to tax liabilities or limited liability, for example, there should not be displacement by co-operatives of individuals who have established their own companies.  There should at least be an element of balance.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society has made observations on this Bill.  Overall, it is broadly supportive of it.  One could argue some of the issues over membership and the make-up, such as the change in the registration number from seven members to three, and issues concerning taxation and the audit exemption, give rise to concerns.  If, however, we accept we should encourage, foster and incubate the concepts of co-operatives, allowing them to become innovative, see beyond their immediate remit and evolve continuously, they can avoid stagnation.  Certain co-operatives stagnated once their initial membership fell away.  Very few were able to continue to evolve and be creative.  Something that could stimulate a yearning to evolve continuously and respond to advances in technology and changes in the economy, society, general outlook, legislative supports, statutes and taxation would be beneficial.<\/p><p>It would be a good concept to bring this Bill into the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  The Government has had a stakeholders' consultation process and, with that in mind, we could ensure that whatever Bill is brought back to the floor of the D&aacute;il has broad support and takes into account the practicalities of what a co-op should be about, not an ideological view of what a co-op is about.  It is for members and for participation and it stresses loyalty from and to membership while, at the same time, being creative and consistently innovative.  The co-ops that have been successful in this country are ones that have been dynamic but many have been lethargic.  Once the initial fervour of the establishment of the co-op fades away, there is little left, the co-op is hollowed out and does not make a contribution.  I would like to see ideas around that concept and how to create a framework for co-ops to consistently innovate.  That would require imagination in taxation and incentivisation through the taxation codes primarily.<\/p> <p> There is potential.  There were successes in the original creameries, which were established long ago, and in the credit union movement.  There is opportunity in the area of alternative wind energies for individuals to come together in a community wherein they can establish these types of infrastructural developments for the benefit and participation of members and the community.  A sharing of dividends within that community and the broader community is a good concept and should be encouraged.<\/p> <p> While I support the concept of the Bill, it needs to go through some form of scrutiny to embrace the concept of what a co-operative should be, pragmatically speaking, rather than just ideologically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550167200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute briefly on the Industrial and Provident (Amendment) Bill brought before us by my Independents 4 Change colleagues and I.  It is a long overdue Bill that will amend the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 in important respects, as my colleagues have outlined, and provide for connecting matters.<\/p>  <p>  A co-operative by definition is an autonomous association of persons united to meet common economic, social, and cultural goals.  They achieve their objectives through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.  Co-operative movements emerged after the industrial revolution because of the upheavals and very bad treatment that workers and producers of that era endured.  In England, people such as Robert Owen and enterprises such as the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers were notable.  In Europe, Raiffeisen Banks emerged as co-operative credit providers in response to restrictive credit conditions. <\/p>  <p>  As my colleagues have outlined, Ireland has a long history of co-operative effort under the leadership of Sir Horace Plunkett, R. A. Anderson, Fr. Finlay and others.  The Irish co-ops thrived from the 1890s and we are proud of our history, through the decades.  My colleague has said, of course, that some of these co-ops later morphed into public liability companies, plcs.  Some of the responsibility for that lies with the Minister of State because he and the Government have not come forward with modernising legislation because his party did not want to and neither did Fianna F&aacute;il.  They did not want to support the co-operative movement.  Deputies Connolly and Pringle also mentioned the famous Fr. James McDyer and the Comharchumann na nOile&aacute;n.  We have a proud tradition in this area, going right back.<\/p>  <p>  Co-operative financial services have also been successful in Ireland with the establishing of the credit union movement.  It came to this country from the United States through the great John Hume, who started the first one in Derry.  They began to develop all around the country.  The Government's attitude to co-operative development was shown to some extent in the crash era in how it dealt with credit unions and building societies.  For no good reason, the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, backed the Educational Building Society, for example, which was owned by its depositors, including my family, into Allied Irish Banks.  Similarly with the credit unions, a quarter of a billion euro was put forward because credit unions were going to collapse but he never said, of course, that only &euro;14 million or &euro;15 million was used.  Fine Gael's attitude to credit unions and the co-operatively owned financial sector has always been a bad and unsupportive one.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the fact that the Progressive Credit Union in my own constituency is about to launch a current account with a debit card, chequebook and so on.  That is a valuable development although it could have happened 30 years ago.  It did not happen because Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael were not prepared to bring in the legislation to make it possible.<\/p>  <p>  We are all familiar with the development co-ops in Europe.  We still wonder why the Sparkassen bank has not been allowed or encouraged to come into this country.  I hear Deputy Michael McGrath asking, week in, week out, why we are paying 4% interest rates when the rest of Europe is paying 1%.  Why is that the case?  One of the reasons is that Sparkassen and other groups like that have not been encouraged.<\/p>  <p>  We are familiar with co-op housing and the National Association of Building Co-Operatives, NABCO, and various other approved housing bodies which operate on a co-operative basis.  There are small streets in my constituency which were built by a group of teachers, nurses and other people working together who actually created their own housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is also very familiar with the group water schemes programme.  Horace Plunkett was from the Minister of State's own constituency in Dunsany. <\/p>  <p>  Co-operatives are a powerful tradition in our country and it seems that, in the interim period, and particularly following the horrible years of grotesque capitalism under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, we have totally neglected this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400049#AAA00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1550167200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>There was grotesque socialism around the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400049#AAA00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1550167200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>There was, first and foremost, grotesque capitalism.  At least the Chinese are building houses with their state construction company, which this Government is not doing.<\/p>  <p>  We have a long and proud co-operative history that is still visible today.  There is a legal lacuna and that is the reason the Minister of State is telling us tonight that we need consolidation.  I have been looking for consolidation of the Traffic Acts for 15 or 20 years, nearly as long as I have been in this House, and I am still looking for it.  Will the Government refer this to the Law Reform Commission?  If the Government wants a comprehensive Bill, of which our Bill could be a part, will it bring it forward and stop talking about it?  The Minister of State did not even mention the Law Reform Commission and whether or not it has ever had that task.<\/p>  <p>  Europe has a great history of co-operatives.  Deputy Joan Collins mentioned Italy.  We also know about the Mondragon Corporation in the Basque country.  It is a huge, powerful co-operative for the Basque nation - and it is a nation - within Spain.  It played a role in promoting the economic well-being of the Basque people and all the people of the Iberian peninsula.  The supporting legal systems of those countries are better than ours and that is the key point we are raising here.<\/p>  <p>  The UK has a great tradition.  The 70,000 workers in John Lewis stores own their own company.  A John Lewis store in Liverpool or Manchester, or wherever, is owned by the people on the floor.  It is their company.  Waitrose, the food retailer, is another example.  There is also a great tradition in the British Labour Party with co-ops.  Many Members of Parliament are co-op members.  It is the Labour and Co-Operative Party in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  It is amazing that our legislation dates back to 1893.  The Minister of State mentioned the 2014 Act but, again, Fine Gael has had an opportunity over the past eight years to modernise the legislation and it has not been taken.  It is amazing that we are still relying on United Kingdom legislation that goes back before Independence.  We recently celebrated 100 years of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Given the tradition the Irish tradition of co-ops and worker-owned industrial bodies that we have all outlined, we should have had modernising legislation by now.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill reduces membership criteria from seven down to three.  The Minister of State said he had a consultation on that and mentioned Finland and various other countries.  My colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, in introducing the Bill, said that, in 2014, there were 237,753 small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in Ireland, employing almost a million workers.  Those SMEs have an average of 3.87 employees per business, just over three.  This is how we came up with three as the number that should be pursued.<\/p><p>I do not see why the Minister of State cannot support this provision.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State said only limited companies can have audit exemptions and he has reservations about this provision.  He must acknowledge, however, the cost of an audit for many small co-operatives and social enterprises, which are not focused on profit-making but on service delivery for their communities, can make the model unattractive.  It must be kept simple.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State referred to a statutory instrument concerning electronic filing.  Again, this could be put on a legislative basis rather than through a statutory instrument.<\/p> <p> Tonight&rsquo;s debate is valuable because this is an important sector.  My colleague, Deputy Pringle, outlined a strong case of how it could become more important in the future in, for example, energy, coping with climate change and getting communities together.  Co-operatives still have amazing potential in the finance and social media sectors.  For example, some newspapers, because they cannot survive physically, are becoming the property of their readers online.  That is a wonderful development and a way of sustaining newspapers.<\/p> <p> There are many positive examples in our history of finance, housing and agricultural co-operatives.  It is our hope that the Bill would make the establishment of a co-operative society that much easier to encourage community groups and local workers to adapt to a model which benefits the whole of society.  Co-ops are based on strong values along with providing good jobs and services beneficial to communities.  Long before I was in politics, I was involved in social enterprise.  I am still a director of several community companies.  I know from board meetings over the years the requirements needed to fulfil statutory rules.  People are prepared to do that if they are simple rules.  The Minister of State could kick the ball off tonight by accepting the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400049#AAA00400","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550167800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>This short Bill is designed to amend the current regulations around the establishment of co-operative societies and to make the administrative process involved that bit easier.  To hear the Minister of State's response was disappointing, however.  We are in danger of talking ourselves into complexities which do not exist.  We are not asking for the reinvention of the wheel.  The Society for Co-operative Studies in Ireland and the Centre for Co-operative Studies at UCC provided submissions to the Department's review in 2017, a review which has not been published yet.  I do not see why it cannot be accommodated.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said there is no consensus in reducing the criteria from seven to three members required to register a society.  In fact, the proposal is pretty much in line with what prevails in the rest of Europe.  The other measures we have looked for, such as audit exemptions, are available to other types of companies but not to co-operative societies.  We are not looking for anything special.<\/p>  <p>  When I heard the Minister of State tell us not to be concerned because we love co-operatives and the Government will deal with them in a giant repealing Bill, it reminded me of the approach to the updating of the coroner legislation, which is rooted in the 1960s.  We were told not to amend it just to deal with maternal deaths because the Government would amend the whole legislation.  At that stage, it had been under review for 18 years.  After three years of messing around, the Government decided to come with a stand-alone Bill to deal with the one aspect of maternal deaths, which, incidentally, we still have not passed.  The response to this Bill is identical.<\/p>  <p>  There is no conflict for the Government to pass this Bill.  If it has a bigger project, then it can work away on it.  Meanwhile, we can build on this legislation.  While we can all claim we support co-ops, we lag far behind the UK and the rest of Europe in this area.  There has to be a reason for that.  Given our proud history, we are not ideologically opposed to co-operatives.  It is because the mechanisms to support co-ops are not as robust in Ireland as they are in other jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of co-ops is ideological.  I make no apology for that.  The model is resilient, democratic and based on values which provide good jobs and good services beneficial to communities.  They can obviously range in size from large companies to a small cr&egrave;che or an initiative dealing with housing waste, energy or football teams.  It is a fact that because of the ideology and the basis on which they are established, there are much more likely to reinvest their profits into resources, training, education and so forth, rather than dealing with shareholder profits.  There are far less likely to contribute to environmental damage in their locality.  They tend to be much more locally based which in this era of sustainability is particularly important.<\/p>  <p>  We make no apology about placing this issue in the context of the economic turmoil that prevailed over the past decade which revealed quite starkly for many the insecurity of the market.  It was a situation which had devastating consequences for jobs as well as vital services in our communities, especially our rural communities.  It is no coincidence that the impact of this same economic turmoil in areas of the UK and Europe which had co-ops was far less devastating.  For example, in Spain, 24% of Spanish companies were forced to close but only 6% of co-ops.  There is a value in co-ops.  We know from research in Scotland that the co-operative model is much more likely to succeed in the first five years than other start-ups.  Given the amount of money taxpayers pay to start-up businesses, many of which end up failing, the success rate is far better with co-ops.  It makes sense all round that we would invest in these co-ops.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill we are putting forward is to strengthen the legal framework to ensure the co-operative sector is given the opportunity to fulfil its potential, as well as ensuring good governance and transparency which are important.  Our measures do not in any way conflict with that.  As Deputies said earlier, there are many examples in Ireland such as the Dublin Food Co-op and the Quay Co-op in Cork.  The latter was established in 1982 by great activists like Arthur Leahy.  It is a progressive workplace and business with a restaurant, bakery and three shops providing good foods, sustainable products, recyclable packaging, green energy resources and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  We know the model has been incredibly successful.  It can be adapted into areas such as waste collection.  In my area, we have conducted detailed surveys on this.  After privatisation, bin services operate in a non-regulated environment with consequences such as fly tipping.  Residents have the nightmare of emissions with different bin company trucks going up and down their roads every single day of the week.  We have suggested running a pilot scheme where the residents would provide that service as a co-op and operate their own bin trucks.<\/p>  <p>  In the past decade, we have seen many companies shutting down.  In 2016, a survey of small and medium-sized enterprises showed that half had no succession plans at all.  In many instances, such companies die with the owner.  The co-op model fits in very much with that and where worker buy-outs can save the jobs which otherwise would be lost.  It is particularly pertinent against the rise of precarious employment which presents significant insecurity for workers in so many aspects of their lives.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that a report from the UK trade union and co-operative sectors has called for joint initiatives to sustain decent work for people and protect them from the poverty trap.  The trade union co-op platform is trying to advance worker ownership and control in the service industry to avoid what has taken place because of the ideology of the market, neoliberalism, the race to the bottom, insecure contracts and people not knowing what is what.<\/p><p>Surveys have shown the impact of a working environment on people's mental health.  There are very good studies even from America.  There are many examples such as a simple bicycle shop where workers take ownership of it.  They might be doing the same job they were doing previously but because they can set their own agenda and be responsible to themselves, it is an entirely different situation.<\/p> <p> There is no reason for the Government not to accept the Bill.  I am mindful that the Bill deals with workers' rights and many workers in this House were here very late last night and are here late tonight, and I know do not want to prolong things.  It is unfortunate the House is sitting longer these nights because it is not good for our staff who are here either.  I think the Government can accept the Bill.  The Minister of State should rethink and let it move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400050#BBB00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550168400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies from the Independents 4 Change group for introducing the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill 2018.  Sinn F&eacute;in is very happy to lend our support to the Bill, as it is important legislation which will have a significant impact on the development of Ireland&rsquo;s co-operative sector.<\/p><p>We welcome the amendment to reduce the number of members needed to establish a co-operative from seven to three.  From a number of engagements we have held with stakeholders in the sector, we were continually told that this was a major barrier to the establishment of smaller co-ops.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in shares the view of the Deputies in the Independents 4 Change group that the development of our co-operative sector is vital to the development of a fairer economy.  If we are serious about addressing inequality in our society, we must deal with the inequality of ownership in our economy.  Co-operatives offer an alternative model of business which is focused on worker outcomes, worker well-being and community sustainability.  They retain economic power at a local and regional level, and allow for community wealth building.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to developing our co-operative sector, particularly our worker co-operative sector.  These are co-operatives in which the workers of the enterprise own at least 51% of the shares.<\/p><p>Across Europe, worker co-operatives have been found to be more productive, more resilient and to provide greater benefits to their workers, communities and society.  Worker co-operative businesses are also more likely to pay the living wage, have lower pay differentials between the top and lowest earner, use fewer zero-hour contracts, and have shown exemplary degrees of corporate social responsibility and a strong commitment to sustainability.<\/p><p>Scotland is quickly becoming one of the world&rsquo;s leading countries in the development of worker co-operatives.  In 2005, the Scottish Government decided to establish Co-operative Development Scotland, a subsidiary of Scottish Enterprise, tasked with the responsibility of developing Scotland&rsquo;s co-operative sector.  In 2012, it made the decision to focus exclusively on the development of worker co-operatives and it has since seen a substantial threefold increase in the number of worker co-operatives.  The Scottish Government chose to actively develop the sector through Co-operative Development Scotland, coupled with supportive legislation.<\/p><p>A quote from John Clark, chair of an employee-owned business and member of the steering group sums up the approach in Scotland as follows, <\/p><blockquote>We have a choice: to be passive and allow the development of a support environment for EO companies [workers' co-ops] to happen without industry input, or to take a proactive approach and seek to actively influence how that environment evolves.  We believe the proactive approach creates the prospect of making Scotland the best country in the world to establish and grow [workers' co-ops].<\/blockquote><p>Scotland is now clearly reaping the rewards.  Elsewhere in Europe, there are 800,000 workers in the Italian worker co-operative sector.  As Deputy Broughan mentioned, Spain is home to the world&rsquo;s largest worker co-operative, Mondragon, which has 80,000 workers and in 2015 had sales of &euro;11 billion.  The worker co-operative sector accounts for 13% of Sweden&rsquo;s GDP, 16% of Switzerland&rsquo;s, 21% of Finland&rsquo;s, and 4% in France.<\/p><p>For many stakeholders, a key barrier to the development of a worker co-op sector has been an absence of state policy supportive of the sector, and even the existence of legislation which makes it more difficult to establish co-operatives, such as the Irish rule requiring seven members to establish a co-op.  That is why in 2014, the French Government introduced the social co-operative law which specifically introduced legislation supportive of the worker co-operative sector.  Italy has the Marcora and Basevi laws and Spain has its laws to assist worker co-ops.<\/p><p>Despite the many benefits of the worker co-operative model to workers and their communities, Ireland has yet to develop its own worker co-operative sector in any significant way.  To date, the worker co-operative sector here can be described as undeniably small and arguably underdeveloped.  This could be put down to two reasons, namely, a lack of legislation specific to worker co-operatives and an absence of Government support for would-be and existing co-operatives.  This lack of co-operative development is particularly disappointing given that throughout Ireland&rsquo;s history, agricultural and financial credit union co-ops have made a significant contribution to our society.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see the success of both of these co-operative sectors replicated in the development of our own worker co-operative sector.  Similar to the Credit Union Act 1997, we should continue to progress legislation like this Bill in order to assist the sector with supportive legislation.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will table an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to introduce a simple definition of a worker co-operative which could be inserted into the Industrial and Provident Societies Act in order to provide the sector with further support and protection.<\/p><p>In 1988, the Government attempted to develop the co-operative sector through the establishment of the co-operative development unit, CDU.  This State body was devoted to the development of worker co-operatives and resulted in the growth of worker co-ops from 47 enterprises in 1991 to 73 in 1992, and again between 1996 and 1998 there was another spike from 66 to 82.  Some argued that the unit would have been even more successful in developing the sector if it were not for the absence of a supportive legislative framework at the time.  Disappointingly, however, Fianna F&aacute;il in government closed down the CDU, ending all soft and hard support for the development of worker co-operatives.  Since its closure, there has been no provider of support or information specific to worker co-ops, something which has been central to the development of the sector in Scotland, France, Italy and Spain.<\/p><p>In keeping with ILO recommendation 193 of 2002, Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see an environment in which co-operatives enjoy equal treatment with other types of enterprise.  Governments should create an enabling environment and facilitate access to support services.  Governments should provide policy and a legal environment conducive to the creation of worker co-operatives, provide grant support and develop partnerships with co-ops.<\/p><p>The success stories of Scotland, France, Italy and Spain all provide evidence that there is an alternative way to develop our economy.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants a sustainable economy, not one driven by profit, but maintained by secure jobs and broad benefits shared by greater society.  This is achievable through a co-operative economy.  In order for this to happen, legislation such as this Bill is essential.<\/p><p>I again thank Deputy Clare Daly and her colleagues in Independents 4 Change for introducing the Bill, which Sinn F&eacute;in is very happy to support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400051#CCC00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1550168400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I am conscious that not everyone was here when I spoke earlier.  I will not go back over the whole speech.  I thank the Members who have introduced the Bill.  I accept that they are interested in the area.  There is always the suggestion, as Deputy Pringle said, that the Government does not want this and we will put it on the long finger.  Opposition Deputies always assume that we do not want things even though we have a duty to bring forward proper legislation.  Just because the Independents 4 Change put something in a Bill does not make it absolutely right.  It does not mean that we always oppose it either.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and the Department are committed to reform.  That process of change started at the end of 2017 and early 2018 before the Bill was introduced.  I am sure the Bill Deputy Joan Collins introduced in July had an influence on some of the changes that happened in December.  However, she should accept that the Minister had started a process to review this area and make changes.  The Department has form in this.  It introduced a massive piece of work - I think about ten years of work - in the Companies Act 2014.  Deputy Kelleher was probably a Minister of State in the Department at the time it started and it was followed through in our time in government.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is committed to reform.  The assumption that is it always against reform or change is not always true and it is not always fair to say that.  There is a process it needs to go through and it started some time ago.  It is not being long-fingered.

Let us recognise that piece of work because I know the amount of work that went into introducing the changes and consolidation in the other Act.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree on the benefits of co-operatives.  As we have outlined, in the credit union movement, in agriculture and even in housing, co-operatives have been doing great work.  I look forward to seeing credit unions funding housing proposals which have been provided for in changes to legislation.  The sooner that comes together, the better.  We recognise that.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that we all recognise the continuing importance of the co-operative movement throughout Ireland.  Furthermore, we all share a strong desire to modernise legislation that underpins the continued sustainability and success of the co-operative model.<\/p><p>We diverge only on how to achieve these aims.  That is part of the work we have to do and we will tease through that in the months ahead.  The Minister is very clear that she would like to work with the Deputies on this in the months ahead and has asked for their co-operation in that regard.<\/p> <p> The proposed Bill may be well intended but it cannot be supported by the Minister in its current form for the reasons I outlined in my opening remarks.  The Minister would like to avoid the introduction of more piecemeal and fragmented legislation in this important area.  She is also concerned about the introduction of measures that will reduce transparency and which could result in unintended consequences that may have a negative impact on the co-operative movement, a movement that we all want to support.  We already have a strong co-operative movement in this country, although one would think, having listened to some of the speeches tonight, that we do not.  <\/p> <p> The Minister considers that a more appropriate course of action is to consolidate into one statute all existing industrial and provident societies legislation and to modernise it to eliminate outdated provisions and align it with the realities of a 21st century business and regulatory environment.  This will ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities and will provide a conducive framework for the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised.  Deputy Kelleher made reference to the importance of a level playing field earlier.  <\/p> <p> Deputies asked why it is taking so long to complete the review in order to modernise this whole area.  The Government recognises the continued importance of the co-operative movement throughout Ireland, particularly to local rural communities, with over 200,000 such companies registered in Ireland.  The focus of the Department in recent years has been on consolidating, reforming and modernising our companies legislation and getting that piece right.  This has been a major contributory factor to continued investment and new start-ups during the years when we needed new jobs in large numbers.  This Department has form in producing legislation and action plans to facilitate the provision of additional jobs.  That was the Department's focus and this significant undertaking, involving the largest volume of substantive legislation in the State's history, has been completed successfully and the new legislation now forms the basis for Ireland's business regulatory environment.  The Companies Act 2014 was followed by the transposition of a number of EU directives including EU 2006\/43\/EC, as amended by EU 2014\/56EU, the coming into force of EU Regulation No. 537\/2014 as well as the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 and the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018.  There was a lot happening in this space and a lot of change.  The Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act which came into effect in 2014 was aimed primarily at easing the regulatory burden on co-operative societies.  It addressed particular problems that were identified in the co-operative sector and has helped to ensure that this model thrives and grows.<\/p> <p> The Minister wants to ensure that the review currently under way takes on board all of the views of interested parties.  The public consultation process is complete and it is important that the review takes into account all of the views expressed, some of which differ to those expressed by Deputies in the House today.  Deputies Pringle and Kelleher referenced the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society, ICOS.  Interestingly, ICOS made a submission to the Department only yesterday with some observations on this Bill.  It was very clear that it favours retaining the seven member minimum because it believes that a lower number might bring visibility and sustainability into question.  Deputies have portrayed as gospel the need to lower it but that is not gospel according to members of the sector.  It is important that we have proper consultation and tease out all of the issues involved.  ICOS also emphasised the importance of annual returns for transparency purposes.  It said that it would prefer the audit exemption to be in primary legislation rather than by ministerial order.  I make these points to demonstrate that there are other views out there on these issues.  The Deputies seemed to suggest that everything they have put forward is right but it is the job of the Department to tease it through, to get everyone's views and to bring forward legislation of which we can all be proud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400051#CCC00500","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550169000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Independents 4 Change Deputies would appreciate a copy of the ICOS submission, if possible.  The Minister of State has said that the Government is with us regarding co-operatives.  While I welcome that, the problem is that I have not seen any evidence of it.  I have not seen any evidence of a sense of urgency either.  We are talking about 121 years to bring in the 2014 Act, 123 years to bring in the review and 126 years later, we are looking at Victorian legislation.  As I have said previously, it is ironic that the English have changed it for the better in terms of facilitating and encouraging co-operatives on the ground in every way possible.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Bill itself, I will be the first to admit that it is not perfect.  However, it is a Bill that is being supported by almost everyone in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, with the exception of Fine Gael Members, although I am not sure where the Labour Party stands on the Bill.  It is interesting to note that when the Labour Party was in power with Fine Gael, that Government had a massive majority but the legislation was not changed.  That is when it should have been changed, as I am sure the Minister of State would agree.  That Government had a massive majority and if it was seriously interested in supporting the co-operative movement, it should have done so then.  That said, if the Government has had a moment on the road to Damascus, I welcome that.  I truly welcome the fact that this D&aacute;il is going to work on behalf of the co-operative movement.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State pointed out that events have overtaken us in some senses and I welcome that.

The point is that they can be made very quickly without any problems and yet there is a big problem with regard to co-operatives, despite the overwhelming evidence on the ground, across Europe and elsewhere, of their importance.  This is also despite the evidence from the Government's own documents which emphasise the importance of the co-operative movement, including the Forf&aacute;s report on social enterprise in Ireland which was published in 2013 and the Government's White Paper on Ireland's transition to a low carbon future, among other policy documents.

All Bills at this stage of the process are far from perfect but that is why we have a legislative process.  That is why Bills go on to the next Stage, to be discussed in detail.  That is also why there is pre-legislative scrutiny.  The resources on the side of the Government are enormous.  David and Goliath springs to mind in the context of the resources available to the Opposition, although things are changing slowly in that area.  We will have access to draftsmanship in the future.  At this point, however, this is a basic Bill which contains a number of provisions.  The provision relating to electronic filing has been overtaken by events, which I appreciate.  The provision relating to reducing the number to three was a common theme in the submissions and is also in keeping with Europe and other countries.  At the very least, if the Government is sincere about supporting co-operatives on the ground, then it should let this Bill go to Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Let it be teased out.  Give an opportunity to the stakeholders to make their presentations to the committee.  This would show real bona fides on the part of the Government.  Co-operative legislation has never been discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il until now, 2019.<\/p> <p> If the Minister of State thinks this is negative, he needs to refer to a dictionary.  What we have done with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in is table an important Bill.

I accept there are deficiencies in the Bill.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State spoke about a lack of transparency and accountability.  I, above anyone else, would never stand over a system that lessens accountability.  I spend every Thursday at the Committee of Public Accounts where, week after week, we see the effect of bad governance and lack of processes.  This Bill has nothing to do with that.  The purpose of reducing from seven to three the number of members required to register a society brings it into line with other European countries to align it with the companies that do not have the same demands upon them.  In regard to the accounts, it is an enabling provision.  Regulations can be made.  In regard to audited accounts, that can be included.  It is one of the major requests from the various submissions because it is such an onerous task on small co-operatives.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; deis iontach anseo don Rialtas a chur in i&uacute;l do na comharchumainn ar an talamh go bhfuil s&eacute; taobh thiar den ghluaiseacht seo.

We have pointed out the advantages for co-operatives on the ground and the wonderful opportunities that present, from agriculture, to recycling, to the energy we need urgently in terms of climate change.<\/p> <p> I do not think the Minister of State is going to change his mind at this point.  I ask him to look again at the positive aspects of this Bill.  It has put the issue of co-operatives on the floor of the D&aacute;il and it seeks only minimal changes.  It is to be hoped it will put substantial pressure on the Government to deliver the legislation that is needed urgently.  We do not need consolidating legislation.  Rather, we need legislation that has a vision for co-operatives, spells out what a co-operative is, and enshrines within it the seven basic principles.  We then need that legislation to be followed with regulations to roll out a competitive co-operative system on the ground that balances all of the aid and assistance being provided to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and, to a lesser extent, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  There is a need for all of this.  The Government is doing this for Enterprise Ireland in the context of Brexit.  Let us see it in regard to the co-operative movement that is struggling on the ground and getting much more value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400052#DDD01100","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550169600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550169600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 21 February 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021400053#EEE00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550169600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.35 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 February 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
