I wish to raise the issue of sickle cell disease and patients with the disease.  Last weekend, I attended a fantastic celebration in Malahide to raise awareness of sickle cell disease.  I have been to several awareness days in recent years.  The organisation in question is an incredibly positive one, even when it comes to dealing with such a serious condition.<\/p> <p>There are more than 600 people in Ireland with sickle cell disease.  More than two thirds of those with the disease are under 18 years of age.  The majority of those with sickle cell disease are treated at two centres of expertise, namely, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, and St. James's Hospital.  It is really important to get early diagnosis in order to prevent early deaths.  The team at Crumlin hospital have done incredible work over many years and have organised neonatal screening that is now carried out at the majority of maternity hospitals.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is aware that the migrant population in Ireland has increased in recent years.  Many of those among the migrant population are genetically predisposed to sickle cell disease.  It is one of two major genetic blood disorders that affect red blood cells.  Those living with sickle cell disease experience many significant difficulties.  My priority in tabling this Commencement matter is to raise awareness of sickle cell disease within the migrant community and for migrants to be empowered to undergo genetic testing.  I very much welcome the fact that the national screening advisory committee has added sickle cell disease as one of its priorities this year.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State will have a comprehensive answer for me, so, rather than asking questions, I wish to highlight a particular family.  Esther Onolememen is the founder and CEO of Sickle Cell Society Ireland.  She is the mother of two children with sickle cell disease.  She has identified to me the importance of a registry of children at risk of this life-threatening genetic condition.  As a result of the lack of screening, there was a delay in finding out that her children have sickle cell disease.  One of her children suffered a stroke at eight months, prior to accessing adequate care in Ireland.  Her daughter suffered life-threatening multiple organ failures while accessing care and spent approximately nine months in hospital, with three ICU admissions.  She completed her junior certificate from a hospital bed in Crumlin.  Thankfully, due to the support of international experts and improved medical care within Ireland, she has recovered.  She is still accessing care in hospital, but more regularly than other cohorts.  Not all of the children with sickle cell disease are lucky enough to survive.  There was a terrible incident in 2019 when a young boy with severe sickle cell disease who fought a deportation order died from complications resulting from his ill health.<\/p> <p>I have a few asks of the Minister of State.  There is a need to work on awareness and a national screening database.  There is a need for awareness in direct provision centres because many people who come here are carriers of the disease but are unaware of that fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#A00500","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator McGreehan for raising this issue and providing me with this opportunity to discuss developments in the area.  The Minister for Health and I fully appreciate that sickle cell disease can place a substantial medical, social and financial burden on patients, their families and their carers.  The Senator outlined exactly what Ms Esther Onolememen and her children had to go through regarding the lack of screening.  It is a lifelong, inherited condition that affects both children and adults.  At present, we have a two-centre approach to treating patients.  Children can access services provided by Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Crumlin hospital, supported by a multidisciplinary team.  Adults can access the services of the haemoglobinopathy service at St. James's Hospital.  In support of these services, the HSE currently reimburses a number of medicines under the community drugs scheme for the treatment of both adults and children.<\/p> <p>I am advised a number of new therapies are in development for sickle cell disease.  The Minister hopes to see those coming on stream as soon as possible, if they are proven to be clinically effective, in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The Senator will be aware the 2013 Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to make decisions on reimbursement of medicines.  In doing so, the HSE takes account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion, as appropriate.<\/p> <p>The service at Children's Health Ireland has expanded rapidly since 2000 to cater for the increased prevalence of the disease.  In 2000, 20 children were undergoing treatment for sickle cell disease.  Last year, 385 children were attending the service, as well as 18 with the related condition of thalassemia.  I am pleased to advise there have been other positive developments in terms of services for children.  The centre at Crumlin is now designated by the HSE as an expert centre for haemoglobin and red cell disorders.  A priority for the HSE in 2022 is to further advance the non-malignant haematology service at CHI Crumlin.<\/p> <p>As regards adult services, St. James's Hospital has provided these services since 2014.  The scale of activity has also grown from 32 patients in 2014 to more than 220 patients attending the service in 2021.  Since the service was set up in 2014, service growth and development has been ongoing, including the following: the establishment of multidisciplinary outpatient clinics; the development of transition clinics involving regular collaboration and communication with CHI Crumlin; and the development of a maternity service in conjunction with the Coombe hospital.<\/p> <p>However, due to the increased demand, I am advised by the HSE the transition of patients over the age of 16 years to adult services is currently a challenge due to capacity constraints at St. James's.  In order to address this issue, a business case is under consideration with HSE leadership to further increase capacity at St. James's to meet the growing demand for these services.  The Minister hopes this business case can be considered by the HSE in as timely a manner as possible in order that we can begin to see improvements in access to services for adult patients at St. James's as soon as possible. <\/p> <p>I again thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I do not think many people are aware of it.  The number attending adult services has increased from 32 patients in 2014 to 220 patients in 2021.  Some 385 children attended the service last year, which was a major increase from 20 in 2000.  This is an emerging and very serous issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#B00100","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This is a growing medical issue for Irish citizens across this island.  We must grow our medical intelligence to assist doctors to get the best research and care to be passed on to these patients.<\/p> <p>I reiterate the few proposals I would like the Minister of State to bring back to the Department.  I would like it to focus on the cohort of people who are genetically predisposed to this disease, particularly in direct provision centres, to make sure they have screening for sickle cell disease.  Like cystic fibrosis, it takes two carriers to have a child with sickle cell disease.  Children are been born in Ireland and their parents do not know that they have sickle cell disease.  I called for the setting up of a database and registry to examine the geographic spread and to consider the possibility of having satellite care clinics.   If one is based in Galway or Cork, travelling to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital or CHI Crumlin would involve a major financial cost and often those people do not have those financial resources.  Research in the area and an awareness campaign are needed, particularly for people who are genetically predisposed to the condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#B00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I have listened to the Senator and can assure her the Minister appreciates the difficulty faced by people suffering from this awful condition.

That is a very worthy solution to a very difficult issue.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt with the growing prevalence of the disease, services for adults are stretched.  The services available for those with sickle cell disease faced capacity challenges in recent years as the demand for both paediatric and adult services have increased.  I am pleased to inform the Senator the HSE continues to enhance and develop these services in order to provide the necessary level of care to those suffering from this condition.<\/p> <p>It is encouraging that the centre at CHI Crumlin has been designated as an expert centre for haemoglobin and red cell disorders.  The good work of the HSE at the expert centre in Crumlin was reflected in the approval in 2017 by the European Commission for the inclusion of CHI in the European reference network, EuroBloodNet, and further developments at the centre have been prioritised by the HSE in 2022.

He does not need me to tell him about the difficulties that exist in our acute hospitals and the significant delays people have in getting access to bed capacity.  Much of the elective work is now delayed because of the crisis in accident and emergency departments.  Some of that relates to the inability of patients to move from the care facility, which is the acute hospital, into either a step-down facility or back home.  Therefore, there is a passage through the system for many.<\/p> <p>I have identified what I believe is one of the very considerable difficulties that exist.  It is the inability of the HSE or many of the other service providers to be able to hire home care assistants.  From his constituency work over the years, the Minister of State will have had people come to him seeking more home care hours to be made available by the State.  In order words, they want the State to put money aside to enable people to be cared for in their home and for them to allow them to live out their lives there.  That used to be a problem but that is not the problem any more.  The money is in place for the service but the problem is the service providers cannot get staff to fill those hours.  Many more people could be living out the latter days of their lives in their own home if there were care assistants available to them.  <\/p> <p>I have met many care assistants and I do so on a regular basis.  Some of them are now leaving the service.  The only reason they are doing so is that they are not being properly looked after financially.  The wages are poor but many of them are prepared to do the job because it is flexible work.  What is killing them in the current climate is the cost of travel.  The profile of the Minister of State's constituency is not that much different from mine.  A carer might care for a person who lives ten or 15 miles from where the carer lives and visit that person at 8 a.m.  By 11 a.m. the carer has to be with another person somewhere else.  By 2 p.m. the carer has to be with another person.  By 5 p.m. the carer has to be with another person and by 9 p.m. the carer might be back with the person he or she visited first that morning.<\/p> <p>Carers may travel more than 100 miles, or sometimes 200 miles, in a day depending on the profile of the people they look after.  It is not sustainable for those people to be asked to continue to do that work at the rate they are being paid for mileage.  It is abysmal.  They just about got by when diesel and petrol was somewhere between &euro;1 and &euro;1.12 or &euro;1.13 per litre.  It is now &euro;2.13 per litre.  These are people on very low incomes in the first instance.  They provide a phenomenally valuable service.  Without them many more people would be in the care of State, putting a further burden and pressure on the acute services, further lengthening the wait time in places like University Hospital Limerick, UHL.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We saw from the HIQA report the appalling display of service available to patients.

As the price of fuel continues to spiral out of control, and we accept that is outside of our control, these people will not be able to keep their cars on the road and continue to travel and do the great work they are doing.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to look at every line item in the budget of his Department and try to find an appropriate amount of money to make it possible for these people to do their work.  Their low wages can be dealt with through the normal labour relations mechanism.  I have argued about this before and will again.  However, there needs to be an urgent intervention putting in place a few extra cent to make it possible for them to do their phenomenal work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#B00600","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dooley for raising this issue which is raising its head all over the country.  I have seen it in my constituency as well.  As part of the broader Sl&aacute;intecare reform of our health and social care system, the Government is committed to reorientating the model of care towards primary and community care.  In furtherance of this objective, in budget 2021 my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, secured additional funding of &euro;150 million for home support.  This is supporting the development of a statutory home support scheme as well as the delivery of 5 million additional hours of home support.  The funding secured in budget 2021 to provide the additional 5 million hours has been maintained for 2022 and preliminary data indicate that at the end of April 2022, some 6,902,191 home support hours had been delivered nationally to 54,949 people.<\/p> <p>Against this background, the Minister of State is aware that some home support providers require their front-line employees to pay for the travel costs they incur in the course of their duties, and I thank Senator Dooley for raising the matter.  While the HSE pays for the travel expenses incurred by healthcare support assistants whom they employ to provide home support, providers in the voluntary and private sectors do not always do so, nor is there any obligation for them to do so when contracted to provide services on behalf of the State by the HSE.<\/p> <p>This is one of many issues currently being explored by the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, established this group in March 2022 following a call for submissions from relevant stakeholders such as the Senator.  The remit of the group is to identify and formulate recommendations to address strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing home sectors.  Accordingly, the group is examining issues such as recruitment, retention, training, career development and pay and conditions of front-line carers in these sectors so that solutions can be found.<\/p> <p>The group's deliberations will be informed by an evidence review of the role, function and supply of home support workers in four European countries, which has been commissioned by the Department of Health from the Health Research Board and which will provide insight into home support workers' employment conditions internationally.  Stakeholder engagement is also central to the work of the group.  As part of a structured programme of consultative engagements with key sectoral stakeholders, a facilitated workshop was held on 23 May.  The group continues to liaise with these stakeholders to further explore the issues arising and will submit a report for my consideration by September 2022.  The report will outline the group's findings and recommendations as well as an action plan for the recommendations' implementation.<\/p> <p>Concurrently, the Department of Health is preparing a general scheme and heads of Bill to establish a licensing framework for professional home support providers.  Secondary legislation setting out the minimum standards with which providers must comply in order to be licensed and HIQA national quality standards is also being developed.  This will provide a robust regulatory framework for a sector which is at present unregulated, clarifying home support workers' rights and responsibilities.  A public consultation on the draft minimum standards is under way and will close on 28 July 2022.<\/p> <p>I think the Senator is looking for a stipend, effectively, for these great workers who are providing an incredible service.  I would think the sooner we can come up with some solution, the better.  Across the country we are all facing this.  It is an issue we need to address as quickly as possible.  It is not just a service these staff are providing but they are also saving a lot of extra hours in hospitals, nursing homes and so on.  I would like to get this raised.

The State has outsourced this service and does so with other services through section 38 and section 39 agreements.  Clarecare in County Clare is an example.  It was never given back the funding that was cut.  There were plenty of carefully worded responses from Ministers at the time stating it was a matter for the voluntary body to figure out how it paid people and what they did and did not do.  The truth is that when the cut came and the Department cut HSE staff, the cuts were imposed on the private sector operators as well but the money was never properly returned to the level it should have been.

Every time I raise it, I am told that negotiations are taking place between officials.<br\/><br\/>On 5 March 2021, I introduced the Health Insurance (International Students) (Amendment) Bill, with the aim of addressing this matter.  I engaged in discussions with the Department of Health and was told that discussions were taking place in other Departments.  I decided not to proceed with an amendment to the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2021 because I was assured at the time that this matter would be addressed.  As the Minister of State will recall, that assurance was given just a week after a Commencement debate taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  In response to me, the Minister of State said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI know this is causing a lot of bother for students from non-EEA countries studying in Ireland.

On all of those dates, the Senator was informed that work was being done by officials in both the Departments of Health and Justice and a resolution was hoped for in a matter of weeks.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to resolve this matter yet.  However, I have been informed that communication is continuing between both Departments on this issue.  My brief includes a statement that \"I hope it will be possible to resolve in the near future\".  That response is not good enough.<\/p> <p>As I have said, students are coming to Ireland.  They are required to hold health insurance as part of the conditions of securing a visa.   As immigration policy is a matter for the Minister for Justice, this seems to be an issue.  I will give an account of the rationale behind our community-rated health insurance market and where the regulatory mechanisms for it intersect with this issue, as this matter falls within the remit of the Department of Health.  I will also describe supports community rating gives to older and sicker people who decide to avail of health insurance.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will know, we have a voluntary and community-rated market in Ireland.  This means there is no requirement for any person to procure private health insurance under Irish health insurance legislation.  Community rating means that when people decide to purchase health insurance they are not risk-rated and, therefore, not discriminated against on the basis of age, gender or health status.  This is long-established Government policy and ensures that health insurance policies are affordable for everyone.<\/p> <p>In order to maintain a policy of community rating and under the Health Insurance Acts, any person who is ordinarily resident in the State and purchasing private health insurance must buy a community-rated health insurance policy from a registered insurer.  This ensures the products these consumers are buying are regulated by the independent regulator of health insurance, namely, the Health Insurance Authority.  Providers who sell health insurance to consumers must also comply with the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts relating to open enrolment, community rating, lifetime cover and minimum benefits.<\/p> <p>The current issue regarding international students and health insurance arose because travel insurance-type products were being sold to students who were here for longer than one year, in which case those buying health insurance should purchase a community-rated health insurance product.  This was the subject of court proceedings where the court found in favour of the Health Insurance Authority, which took an enforcement action against the company providing these travel insurance policies to students staying for more than one year.<\/p> <p>Irish health insurance legislation does not currently contain any reference to persons who are required to hold health insurance.  This requirement is a part of a person's visa checklist when he or she is preparing to come and stay in this country.  The policies and procedures around visas are not within the Minister for Health's policymaking remit.<\/p> <p>What is needed in this regard is cross-Department co-operation.  Many months ago, we said this matter would be resolved in the future.  It is not good enough that it has not been resolved.  I will bring this matter to the attention of my Department and the Department of Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#D00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I seek the guidance of the Acting Chairperson.

T&aacute; d&iacute;om&aacute; orm nach bhfuil an tAire Oideachais &iacute; f&eacute;in anseo, an Teachta Foley anseo agus ba cheart go mbeadh s&iacute;.  <\/p> <p>It is a shame that the Minister for Education has not seen fit to be able to be here today.  This is a matter I have put tabled on a number of occasions and the Minister of State has come to the House on a number of occasions to reply on issues relating to this school.  It is a shame that the Minister is not here as this is a direct responsibility of hers in the Department of Education, rather than related to the Minister of State's brief, which concerns special educational needs.  I want to put on the record the credit given to the Minister of State by the community of Gaelscoil Laighean for the work she has done in this area.  I recognise that she is supportive of what the community is trying to do.<\/p> <p>As she is very well aware, there is a major issue with Gaelscoil Laighean, a small Gaelscoil currently located in Kill of the Grange in Deansgrange.  It is currently in a two-room building and the school community is extremely stressed about the space available for it to grow.  The reality is that the inaction of the Department is preventing the school from growing.  Until it has the space to grow, it cannot take in extra classes and pupils, despite the fact that there is significant demand for that.  <\/p> <p>The Minister of State will also be aware that for a number of years the school has sought an alternative to the Kill of the Grange site.  One has now been found at Mount Anville and disposed of by the Department of Education, and is now in a position to proceed, although I recognise that there is a certain amount of time involved in creating a school on the site.  However, we also know that there is not enough room in Kill of the Grange for the school to grow in the way it needs.  At the moment, there are 75 students enrolled for September.  It has another class coming in and it does not have the physical space to accommodate it.  <\/p> <p>As far as I can see, the Department has done absolutely nothing to progress the fact that the school needs space for the new class.  The parents and community of the school identified the school site in Mount Merrion that would accommodate the school on an interim basis before moving to the site in Mount Anville.  The Department did not do that work; the parents did.  Notwithstanding that, permission was required to construct the tig&iacute;n, or prefab building, in Mount Merrion to accommodate the school on an interim short-term basis.  <\/p> <p>It was for the Department to make an application to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council under section 5 of the Planning and Development Act in respect of exempted development status for the site so that a building could be put in place.  As I understand it, that application has still not been made and there is no good explanation as to why that has been the case.  There has been talk about this for months.  It is a simple application.  Engineers have attended the site and examined it, and I understand the application is ready or will be submitted soon.  Why has it not yet been submitted?  <\/p> <p>As long as it is not in, all the parents, families and teachers connected to Gaelscoil Laighean are in limbo.  They do not know what is going to happen.  They cannot plan for after-school classes, which were to be made available on the Mount Merrion site.  They cannot plan for commuting to and from the school in the morning.  People living in Mount Merrion have taken their children out of local schools to attend the school in September and now do not know where it is going to be.  <\/p> <p>The interim proposal from the Department, which has been communicated to all parents and An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, is to have a site across the road in the community centre of Kill of the Grange parish.  That is not acceptable.  There is a busy road.  It is proposed that a small school be divided between two sites, which would involve children crossing the road at lunchtime, little or big break or whatever else.  More importantly, that will divide teachers and classes.  It is not a real solution.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will have some information on this.  I want to know why the building has not progressed and why we have not given parents some certainty regarding what will happen with the school in September, which is just a few months away.  I hope we can make progress on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#E00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  As he knows, it is something of which I am acutely aware.  I have had numerous conversations with families whose children want to attend Gaelscoil Laighean.  As we know, we want a permanent building to be provided as soon as possible on the Mount Anville site.  I understand the Department lodged a planning application with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on Tuesday, 21 June, to provide interim accommodation on the Mount Anville site.<\/p> <p>I understand that, as a contingency arrangement, the Department has, as the Senator said, submitted a section 5 application to the council to determine whether a proposal to provide interim accommodation on the grounds of Mount Merrion community centre requires planning permission or is considered exempted development.  I understand it will lodge that application this week.  The interim accommodation, which can be installed on either site once permission is secured, has been procured and is available to the Department for installation.  I am not aware of the reason the application is only being submitted this week.  It would have been preferable for it to have been done before now.  <\/p> <p>I will bring the Senator's Commencement matter to the attention of the planning and building unit and the Minister to make sure that we can expedite the building of a permanent building as soon as possible.  I understand that heads of terms have been agreed and the Department is waiting on draft contracts.  It is expected that conveyancing will conclude shortly. <\/p> <p>That still leaves a gap, as the Senator said, between where we are now and when the children will attend school.  I note what he said about the fact that the interim accommodation in Kill of the Grange would not have the capacity to take in any more children or expand.  He mentioned after-school or afternoon classes and commuting.  <\/p> <p>I understand 39 pupils are enrolled and another 24 are expected to begin in the new the school year.  I believe there are two contingency plans.  One involves the Mount Merrion community centre and the second concerns the parish hall, as the Senator said.  The Department has worked with An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta to identify contingency arrangements.  <\/p> <p>The difficulty is that we know the permanent school building will not be built by September and, therefore, we need to find an arrangement that is satisfactory for the families, whether that involves the use of the parish hall in Blackrock or the Mount Merrion centre, which is near where I live.  Fire and disability access certificates will be required on whichever site is available first.  I understand applications are being prepared.<\/p> <p>The views of parents are critical in ensuring that we have adequate facilities for children and that the commute and after-school activities will not be unduly onerous while the school community awaits the building of permanent accommodation.

I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  Just months before the start of the new school year, we have heard that hundreds of children do not have appropriate school places.  AsIAm, the national autism charity, published a survey earlier this month showing that at least 267 children do not have appropriate school places for September.  According to the survey, at least 112 children aged between one and six are on waiting lists for an appropriate school place.  Just 20% of people who responded have a child with a school place in their locality for September.  It is believed that the actual numbers are much higher than this snap survey has shown.<\/p> <p>Last month, the Government proposed opening five special educational needs centres in Dublin as an emergency measure to respond to the shortage of suitable school places.  I add my voice to those parents and disability organisations who have said this is no solution to a very real problem.  <\/p> <p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has also raised concerns about this proposal.  IHREC monitors Ireland&rsquo;s obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and has called on the Department to take a human rights- and equality-based approach.  It has called on the Government to ensure mainstream educational provision that is fully inclusive of all people with disabilities.  This means making sure children have appropriate school places that meet their needs.  This is an education issue, a disability rights issue and a child&rsquo;s rights issue.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Autism, the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, I have spoken often on how we need to work towards a fully inclusive society that upholds the rights of all our people.  <\/p> <p>The Minister of State said that she plans to start issuing section 37A orders to schools, if needed, to make sure that spaces are available for children in special classes in schools but we know that is a lengthy process.  However, we also know the Oireachtas can pass legislation very quickly when the political will and pressure is there.  Is this not an emergency situation that requires an emergency response?<\/p> <p>My question is very straightforward.  Is the proposal to set up separate special education centres still being considered?  I am looking for a straight \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer if it is possible.  The children, families and their advocates deserve to hear that.  If that plan is no longer being considered, will the Minister of State use her authority to enact emergency legislation to make sure the additional special educational units needed in our schools will be there for September?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#F00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It is very important for me, as Minister for State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, that I support children with additional needs in any way I can.  I have a budget of &euro;2 billion, which is more than 25% of the entire education budget and an unprecedented amount.  It has grown by 60% since 2011.  Due to that, we have been able to put in place many more special education teachers.  We have more than 14,000 of those and more than 19,000 special needs assistants, SNAs.  In addition, special classes and special school places are at unprecedented levels. but, clearly, there is still a gap for some children and we need to make sure that we provide for them.<\/p> <p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, my Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked over the past two years, since I have been in this role, on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process, which has ensured a targeted approach to meet the demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.<\/p> <p>The Department and the NCSE have introduced a number of strategic initiatives to deliver the scale and quantity of special educational needs, SEN, provision required for our children and young people.  The Department has a geographical information system that is being utilised to support a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of SEN provision.  Some of the initiatives that are bearing fruit from that are: 269 special classes opened in September 2021, with a further 33 opening for 2021-22; 315 new special classes opening for the 2022-23 school year; two new special schools established in Cork and Dublin in 2021; and a new special school opening in Cork in the 2022-23 school year.  In addition, there is a new major policy departure in the Department where we got the fee-charging schools under the Spiritan Education Trust to agree to open special classes for the very first time.  It will open a new special school in existing accommodation at the Templeogue College campus in Dublin, with an overall objective to provide a modern permanent provision for the school to enable it to cater for up to 150 pupils when completed, adding very significant capacity for the south Dublin area.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned section 37A of the Education Act.  That process has been initiated for the third time by the Department and I triggered it.  The NCSE wrote to me and formed an opinion that there was insufficient special class capacity in Dublin.  At the moment, we have special class and special school provision completely covered outside of Dublin.  Dublin is the pinch point and that is what we are trying to sort out.<\/p> <p>The NCSE advice in May was that 80 special class places and 49 special school places were still needed for September this year.  Since then, due to much ongoing work, we reduced those places to 56.  We are making progress and we will continue to make progress during the summer.  I recognise how stressful it is for families who are working hard to get sufficient school and special class placements.  <\/p> <p>Stage one of section 37A is now complete.  The Senator will be aware that the process itself is under review.  It needs to be streamlined and truncated.  It is the only tool available to me at present.  However, we want to make sure that we review that properly and that it is more streamlined.  <\/p> <p>On emergency legislation, which the Senator mentioned as well, my Department is considering the need to bring in emergency legislation to assist us in securing additional placements where we do not have them in schools at present.

The issue is the perilous financial situation in Galway County Council in terms of its baseline funding.  Last year when the Minister contacted the county council and gave a very welcome once-off allocation of &euro;600,000, he stated the Department was reviewing the local property tax yield and once available allocations would be reviewed.  I now understand that is not going to be concluded this year.  The review will encompass all local authorities.  However, the Department stated that as previously discussed whether a financial plan specific to County Galway may be appropriate is something we can revisit.  Is that something the Department will now look at?  The Department also stated it was available to support and collaborate on this issue.  I certainly think that a specific case and a plan for Galway needs to be enacted prior to the coming budget, before the councillors have to make their decision in regard to local property tax.  <\/p><p>The baseline figures for Galway are as clear as mud in terms of the revenue budget and revenue <i>per capita<\/i>.  In the 2022 revenue budget, Galway County Council has a budget of &euro;143.9 million.  Comparable counties such as Mayo and Donegal have around &euro;162 million or &euro;163 million although they have lower populations.  That is basically the issue.  The <i>per capita<\/i>figure for Galway is &euro;802 compared with Donegal with more than &euro;1,000 and Mayo at &euro;1,256.  That is the crux of the issue that we are trying to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#G00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>It just shows that there is a team of people here in the west fighting for funding for the population of the west.  We are the seventh largest population with 180,000 people living in County Galway.  We are the second largest county and that means a hell of a lot of roads in Galway.<\/p><p>As a Galway county councillor elected in 2019, I am fully aware of the devastating impact in terms of the roll-out of services to people and families who live in our towns and villages.  This is our rural future.  These are the policies we want to roll out at a local level.  We cannot do it because in my own municipal district of Ballinasloe, which goes from Ballymote, close to Castlereagh in Roscommon all the way down to Banagher Bridge, in one section we have more than three vacant positions out of nine for general operatives.  We are down an engineer.  Another technician was promised last year but is still not in place.<\/p><p>We need clear guidelines on core funding as Senator Kyne as mentioned.  We need to know as it impacts from housing and active travel to fire services and libraries on our ability to provide services in the county for enterprise, our planners, water services, economic development, our tourism and heritage officers who are trying to promote hidden heartlands and trying to bring more income into our area that is already suffering in terms of not being able to access these services that we should be seeing from local authorities.<\/p><p>Senator Kyne and I have been working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will be fully aware that we have raised this a number of times previously.  Our budget is crucial.  As Senator Kyne mentioned it is &euro;802 <i>per capita<\/i>.  To break that down, looking at each section within a local authority, for example, in housing the national average is &euro;480 per person.  In County Galway, &euro;95 per person is allocated.  It is beyond time that we state that Galway County Council needs support now.  It needs exceptional support.  I look forward to the response from the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#G00500","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Kyne and Dolan.  At the outset, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has informed me that both Senators have been in constant contact with him about this issue and secured a package last year through their work, and that he will work closely with them again over the coming period of time.<\/p> <p>The local property tax, LPT, as we know was introduced to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue and associated expenditure decisions.  LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amount to &euro;523.9 million.  This figure includes the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.5 million.  Galway County Council was allocated &euro;14.5 million for 2022.<\/p> <p>In addition to the LPT allocation, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has also agreed a provisional allocation of &euro;4.44 million for Galway County Council in respect of the additional costs that will arise in 2022 as a consequence of the national pay agreements.  This allocation relates specifically to increases in rates of pay and public service pension reductions resulting from the unwinding of financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and increases in pay and pensions relating to Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022.<\/p> <p>The overall aim of the allocation is to ease the burden on local authorities of the increased costs in 2022.  As part of the budget process the Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the financial impact on the sector and secured the allocation which will assist local authorities to meet the costs arising.  Across all schemes and funding resources the Department has provided &euro;82.9 million in 2020 and &euro;85.9 million in 2021 to Galway County Council.  The payments in 2020 also included an allocation to Galway County Council of &euro;1 million, funding that was linked to the operation of municipal districts.  In 2021, Galway received an allocation of &euro;600,000 for additional discretionary income.<\/p> <p>It should also be noted that unprecedented support was provided for local authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic.  One of the earliest priorities was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic while simultaneously supporting local authorities.  In 2020, Galway County Council applied a 100% commercial rates waiver to just over 3,500 businesses and recouped &euro;10.2 million in that regard.  In addition, in recognition of Covid-19 related income losses and additional expenditure incurred, funding of &euro;6.7 million was provided to Galway County Council in 2020.  This support continued in 2021 when the Government introduced a nine-month commercial rates waiver applying to the businesses most seriously affected by the restrictions, and a more targeted waiver for the final quarter of the year.  Galway County Council received &euro;7.3 million for this waiver and an additional &euro;1 million for Covid-19 related income losses and expenditure for 2021.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government commits to bringing forward LPT reforms, including providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county.  The Government has signalled its intention that the move to 100% local retention of LPT will be introduced over the 2023 and 2024 budgetary cycles.  It is expected that the LPT yield will change following revaluation last November and the distribution model will be reviewed when the new yield per local authority is fully quantified.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Josepha Madigan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, final figures are not yet available.<\/p><p>Given the need for timely information to be provided to local authorities for their budgetary process and the need for final local property tax figures to inform that, it is not expected that baselines will be reviewed in advance of the 2023 local authority budget process.  Each local authority position is complex and it is important that sufficient time is taken to analyse and assess potential options in that respect.  Preliminary census data will also form an important input to that deliberation.  The Minister will, however, be considering, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the potential for a move towards 100% retention for 2023.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the current funding pressures on local authorities and, as such, the funding for Galway County Council and other local authorities will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process for 2023 and in the context of the aforementioned final local property tax yield following the revaluation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#G00600","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>That is a very disappointing response.

As Senator Dolan commented, this is about staffing resources to provide services the people of County Galway need, and we need better engagement than we get now.

I acknowledge that Galway County Council moved to increase commercial rates for 2022 to increase the level of funding available to the council, which made an important contribution to the overall position.  Of course, Senators are aware that local authorities may also vary their local property tax rate by up to 15%.  Authorities that increase the rate retain 100% of the additional income, whereas local authorities that decrease the rate bear the full reduction in income.  Galway County Council has opted not to avail of this opportunity to raise additional locally sourced income since 2018.  I am told the council could have benefited from an additional &euro;2.2 million in 2022 if it had applied the additional 15% upward local variation in the same way as many other local authorities have.  That said, the funding position of Galway County Council will be kept under during the 2023 Estimates process.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has an interest in today's contributions and will work very closely with the Senators.

This year, we celebrate 30 years of international relations between Slovenia and Ireland.  Slovenia became an independent country on 25 June 1991, and Ireland, together with other EU countries, has recognised its independence since 15 January 1992.<\/p> <p>However, relations between our two countries go back much earlier than 1992, to the time when the wandering Irish saint, St. Virgil, or St. Feirgil, known as the Apostle of Carinthia, sent Irish monks to preach among the Slovenians.  Those links have strengthened over the centuries through our shared love of language and culture as a cornerstone of the survival of both our nations.  Slovenia became a member of the EU during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of Europe in the spring of 2004.  Slovenia can look back on the success of its Presidency of the EU in 2021, during which it led with great efficiency.  We are delighted by that success.<\/p> <p>Ireland and Slovenia work together in the United Nations and other international organisations to endorse and enhance international peace and security.  We respect international agreements, as the ambassador and I discussed earlier, and the rule of law and we promote multiculturalism and multilateralism.  Slovenia's support for Ireland during the Brexit negotiations and its ongoing support for Ireland as we work through the difficult issues around Brexit are greatly appreciated.  While we are many miles apart from each other geographically, that does not prevent us from having rich bilateral and cultural relations.  There are more than 1,200 Slovenians living in Ireland and many hundreds of Irish citizens have made Slovenia their home.  They share a love of literature and a passion for culture, including singing and dancing.  I welcome the ambassador to the Gallery this morning and wish all the Slovenians who are celebrating their national day a very happy 30th anniversary of the close relationship between our two countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#K00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1655888400,"counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#K00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The ambassador is very welcome.

It would be of serious concern if this proposed new UK Bill of Rights that is being brought forward by Dominic Raab, would seek to in some cases ignore decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and in some ways may undermine the convention.  I ask, given that we hold the presidency of the Council of Europe, that this matter that would be treated as a priority.  I have serious concerns around some of the elements that we understand are being proposed in this new UK legislation.  I ask that the Leader would raise it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  <\/p><p>I also understand that the Department of Justice is about to engage in a consultative process around the use of facial recognition technology.  In this regard, it is my hope that we will have a national strategy on artificial intelligence, AI.

We need to have a debate on the use of AI and facial recognition technology more widely.  I know that in the drawing up of the national AI strategy, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment engaged quite widely.  The approach has been human rights-based and ethically based.  It will be essential that any approach taken by the Department of Justice follows this method.  I would like us to have a debate on those issues.  <\/p><p>Finally, I want to raise an issue that the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, CTTC, will also raise again today.  We have raised this issue previously.  Approximately 300 scheduled bus services are operated by private operators.  They have not been able to avail of the very welcome 20% reduced fares initiative that public transport offer operators have been able to offer nor have they been able to offer the youth-adult travel card, because agreement has not yet been fully reached.

This has now been increased from &euro;4,500 to &euro;6,552 as a result of the decision by the Cabinet.  I raised this issue within our own Fine Gael Parliamentary Party several weeks ago.  Students and businesses on the ground in my own constituency of Waterford raised this issue with me.  It is a perfect example of the Government taking immediate action on a sensible proposal that came from the ground up, through our own parliamentary party.  The Cabinet implemented it yesterday.  It is good for students and for business.  It will mean that students will have more money in their pockets without that affecting their student grant.<\/p> <p>We need a wider discussion, and Senator Malcolm Byrne has suggested this previously, on the student contribution charge and on our grants structure.

This is because many families are just above the threshold to avail of that student grant.  They are being hard pressed as a result of the increases in the cost of living.  A reduction in the student contribution charge would assist all of those individuals and families.

She does not have a reduction in her fare until that point, when travelling on from Limerick Junction to Thurles, she can avail of the 50% fare reduction .

ACRES stands for the agricultural climate rural environmental scheme.  It is a nice name.  I presumed the Department decided on ACRES and tied the name into it.  It is good.  You can cite it quickly.  When I initially looked at it yesterday I was pleased.  It shows the Government's commitment to focus on climate as it relates to the agricultural and rural environment and how we can reward farmers.  We have said across the House, and we all recognise it, that farmers and their representative bodies are absolutely committed to playing their role in environmental protection.  They may need some financial assistance.  They will need additional skills and training and supports.<\/p> <p>This morning, a number of farm representative bodies issued statements saying they were grossly unhappy with the scheme.  It appears now that larger commercial farmers are excluded from it.  There may be a need for some work to be done on the communication of the scheme.  It was only announced yesterday.  To be fair to the Minister and to the Department, they are fiercely committed.  Yet, major farm organisations came out within a few hours to say that they feel left out and that there was a lack of consultation.  They made comparisons with other schemes.  This issue may just be around the communication of the scheme.  I want to feed that information to the Leader.  I know that Members of the Seanad who are involved in agriculture and who are on the agricultural committee will be aware of these statements.  I have no doubt that they will come up at various parliamentary party meetings. <\/p> <p>I also raise the issue of the general scheme for the remediation of dwellings that are damaged by defective concrete blocks.  This is a controversial area.  We have had no final decision on the pre-legislative scrutiny on this comprehensive legislation.  This may present some possible problems.  I do not want to go in too much detail on this, but I will say that we do not have plans for pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  There are some concerns, which I share.  <\/p> <p>I want to inform the House that there will be six hours of meetings tomorrow at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deal with this issue.  The first meetings will be on the remediation of the dwellings.  They will be held between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. tomorrow.  They will deal with the MICA Action Group from Donegal, the Clare Pyrite Action Group and the Mayo Pyrite Action Group.  This will be followed by a meeting from 3.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., where chartered surveyors will be before committee, as will representatives from Engineers Ireland.  The chair of the expert working group will come in after that.  If that was not enough to keep us all going, from 6 pm. to 8 p.m. we will have officials from the Department before the committee.  These will be an extensive six hours of engagement.  It is important for people who represent those communities and for everyone in the country to be aware that this is happening tomorrow.  The politicians are always welcome in the committee, but people can go online and see these meetings.  It will be a lively and active interface.  It might become more obvious during these meetings that there is a real requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny, because this is a huge issue.  In fairness to the Government, it is taking on.  It is difficult to please everyone, but we have to get this legislation over the line.  We have to help people to rebuild their homes, to rebuild lives and to get on.

We must learn the lessons from the pandemic and Brexit that Ireland works best when we work together and work as one, when we are harmonised and pulling together and when we have joined-up approaches and joint aspirations.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement was established by a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, for very good reason.  He also gave the now long-standing promise to give MPs from the North speaking rights in the D&aacute;il.<br\/><br\/>In making this point I feel I am preaching to the choir.  The Leader would have a different approach to her colleagues if she were on the committee.  Let us look at what special committees do.  Autism is an issue that is very important to many of us in the House and we raise it regularly.  It is an issue that affects families throughout Ireland.  The all-Ireland autism centre is based in Armagh.  For special committees that do not vote on legislation, why would we not have elected representatives from the North and the rest of Ireland come to them to contribute?<br\/><br\/>If the Cathaoirleach votes against this proposal this afternoon, he will vote against the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and, most important of all, he will vote against Article 2 of the Constitution, which I often cite in the Chamber.  It states it is the birthright and entitlement of everyone born on the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation.  Let us give expression to this article in a most modest way this afternoon.  I encourage Government members of the committee not to vote against the proposal.  I encourage Government colleagues in the House to speak to the committee members.  We in the Seanad know the benefits of having all-Ireland representation.  For so long the Seanad has had it and it is a greater Oireachtas when it can be national, inclusive and representative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#L00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.<\/p> <p>I want to raise the issue of the 206 Irish women who travelled to the UK in 2021 to receive basic healthcare.  A total of 50% received it under ground C, which is the 12-week limit, and 50% received it under ground D, which deals with terminations for medical reasons.  It is clear that the legislation is failing some people.  It is important in the review of the abortion legislation that we bear this in mind and we do not simply focus on narrow issues.

Tens of thousands of people are living in apartments throughout this city and elsewhere with fire defects.  They are in danger.  Unlike mica, it is very difficult for people in this situation to speak out because it will have an effect on properties in urban areas.  It is important that provision is made in the budget and it is flagged with the Minister not to drag this on but to provide redress for these people.  They are not in the public mindset in the same way as other campaign groups.  This is for good reason.  They feel afraid and unable to speak out.  They are living in fire defective apartments through no fault of their own.  It is important that they get 100% redress and not the loans that have been suggested.  This should also be retrospective.  People need to be able to take action now to make their homes safe.  The longer this drags on, the more people will be afraid to take action because they will not be sure whether they will be able to get the money back.

A bowl of soup and cheese and ham sandwiches is the food that has been provided for a number of weeks in one direct provision centre.  This does not respect equality or the human rights of people.  Hotels in rural parts of Ireland are being sold for direct provision centres.  Hoteliers are making millions of euro off the backs of people's human rights and equality.  People are being treated as though they have done something wrong by fleeing for their lives and seeking asylum in our country.  I am against anyone buying these hotels.  It feeds into the problem and does not go towards ending the direct provision system, which is provided for in the programme for Government.  We are meant to be working on it.  Apart from the White Paper published more than a year ago, there has been very little.  I understand the effects of the coronavirus and the crisis in Europe with the war in Ukraine.

We also had the fodder support scheme announced before that.  I urge all farmers to register online for both schemes.  Regarding ACRES, it is a &euro;1.5 billion scheme and it is going to be live over the four years from 2023 to 2027.  It will be worth &euro;300 million annually and it will benefit 50,000 farmers.  One of the most important points concerning this scheme, however, is that it has been funded from the EU and carbon tax.  Some &euro;740 million of the carbon tax, which, I admit, has been a bit controversial, is now being used to fund this scheme.  It is important to show the benefits of what can be done.  We have been unfortunate with the carbon tax because of what happened with the war in Ukraine.  It was difficult for people to accept it, but it is good to see that some of this money will now be used for this scheme.  This &euro;740 million is a significant chunk of the carbon tax money.  Some of the basic aspects of this scheme include that the maximum payment will be &euro;10,500 and the average payment will be &euro;7,000.  The scheme will not suit all farmers.  Dairy farmers are not happy.  It is, however, a good scheme, with many options.

This issue has been raised already.  The 20% discount in fares has created inequality.  Senator Cummins mentioned the Expressway buses.  The private transport operators now find themselves in competition with public transport in some areas.  They are losing customers because of the cheaper fares available on public transport.  While competition is always healthy, it is not the coach tour operators that would benefit from cheaper fares but the people using the services.  The 20% fare discount should apply across the board for all transport users, whether they are using public transport operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann or the services of private coach operators.<\/p> <p>Many places in rural Ireland have services operated by the private coach owners.  It is not fair that people elsewhere should be able to avail of the 20% fare reduction.  In this House, we have been asking for the 20% fare reduction to be extended beyond the end of this year because it is encouraging people to use shared transport.  It also feeds into the Government&rsquo;s climate agenda in respect of people using transport and sharing services in this regard.  This should be done and I would like the support of the Leader in this regard.  I support the call made by Senator Cummins for a debate on the 20% fare reduction and public transport in general.<\/p> <p>I also welcome that Shannon and Knock airports were acknowledged by the World Health Organization, WHO, last week, at a ceremony attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, as being age-friendly airports.

What she did not mention, of course, is that the vast majority of abortions are now taking place in Ireland and that the figures for abortions taking place have vastly increased since abortion was legalised.  Thousands more innocent lives have been lost.  This is something we should think about.  There are children who would be alive today who are not because we legalised abortion in Ireland.<\/p> <p>The other aspect worth mentioning is that, as far as I am aware, of those British statistics concerning the couple of hundred Irish women giving Irish addresses, the biggest single reason in the context of disability was Down's syndrome.  This is something that proponents of abortion do not mention and it is something that should make us all think.<\/p> <p>The principal issue I raise with the Leader is the recent out-of-court settlement for &euro;70,000 which arose out of a child having had an accident in a playground.  It caused an injury, a scar, that Mr. Justice Simons said was just about noticeable.  Nobody begrudges anybody a settlement that they manage to get in the context of a personal injuries action.  The maximum award under the personal injuries guidelines agreed by the Judicial Council for an accident like this, however, is &euro;30,000.  When we think about this, that is &euro;40,000 less of Dublin ratepayers' money that is available for library services, housing, health, road repairs and all the other things the public and councils must fund.  It raises the question of liability and the consequences for schools if awards like this keep getting paid out.  Will playgrounds have to close?<\/p> <p>The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs heard a few years ago that one of the causes of childhood obesity may well be the new conservative approach being taken by schools towards play and playgrounds precisely because of the fear of litigation.  Some years ago, I placed the Civil Liability (Schools) Bill 2019 on the Order Paper.  It would have given added protection to schools and teachers, particularly in circumstances where school grounds were being adequately supervised, protecting them from large payouts.  I ask the Leader whether she agrees with me that in the light of the danger of excessive settlements, which ultimately cost the taxpayers, it is time to consider giving Government time to my Bill and to put it back on the Order Paper in order to afford some greater measure of protection to schools that are supervising play and playgrounds properly, protect them from excessive payouts and thereby facilitate play, which is a very important aspect of children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#N00400","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I raise the issue of the crisis in the home care sector.  I would welcome if it would be possible for the Leader to arrange a debate on this subject.  It is widely accepted that older people live longer and happier lives when they are in their own homes and communities.  Home care packages are essential to facilitate this.  I understand that more than 5,000 people are waiting on a carer to call to their homes.  In my area of Cavan-Monaghan, 60 people are waiting on a carer and more than 300 people are waiting on additional hours.  Again, no carers are available to provide those hours.<\/p> <p>It must be acknowledged that the Government has increased the number of home care hours allocated and this is only right.  This year, for example, more than 23.5 million hours have been approved, an increase of 2 million hours on the previous year.  There is, however, a lack of carers, and this is a part of the problem.  This comes down to issues such as pay and conditions and these issues must be addressed.  I would welcome a debate on this matter.  Many people have argued that the solution to this problem is to allocate the moneys or hours provided for a carer to a family member, if one is available, to provide care.  In many cases, there are family members available.<\/p> <p>We need creative thinking on this vital issue.  As I said, older people live longer and more happily in their own homes.  Of course, at some point, they may have to go into long-term residential care, but until that happens, we must do everything we can to support older people in their own homes.

I will formally write to the Cathaoirleach on the matter today but I wish to propose on the Order of Business that we, as a House, set aside a sitting day or days to discuss disability issues.  We could take an approach similar to that of the Ceann Comhairle in bringing young people into the Lower House to discuss the very important and pressing matter of climate change.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee did something similar a couple of years ago.  As a House, we should put together a series of meetings with organisations and people with disabilities across the whole spectrum so that we can have a strong debate to feed into a narrative to help the Ministers at the Departments of Health, Justice, Education and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to come up with a policy and policy implementations in respect of disability.<\/p><p>I know the House has no role in budgetary matters.

It is because, ten years ago next year, a family in Duleek lost their daughter through cystic fibrosis.  Ann and Kevin Noone lost their daughter Kelley.  We come together every year for a run in Duleek in memory of Kelley and her cousin Cathy, who also lost her life to cystic fibrosis.  Both of them were teenagers.  This week, I have been contacted by four parents who told me that a new and potentially life-saving medicine for cystic fibrosis has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for use by parents of children between six and 11 years of age.  The treatment, Kaftrio, is an oral medicine designed to increase the quality and function of cystic fibrosis proteins at a cellular level, offering physicians a new treatment option for these young patients to help combat their condition as early as possible.  There have already been remarkable results for patients who have opted for this new therapy.  The manufacturing pharmaceutical company, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, has come to an agreement in respect of the supply of Kaftrio to Ireland for use by Irish children with cystic fibrosis, many of whom will be starting their course of treatment this summer.  However, some parents recently learned that their children have been excluded from access to this medicine.  Approximately 35 children with cystic fibrosis have been deemed ineligible.  Two of them live in my area.  Parents of the children have reached out to Vertex to avail of Kaftrio directly but, as it is outside the HSE scheme, such a supply would come at a steep premium.  I understand that Cystic Fibrosis Ireland has reached out to both Vertex and the HSE on the issue as a matter of urgency, but if we were to write to the Department of Health and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on the matter, we might be able to help these 35 children.  I would like the Leader to write to the Minister on this issue because he probably would not listen to me.  I will send this on to him but her word would probably be a lot stronger than mine.  This would be a huge benefit to these parents and children.  Children with cystic fibrosis, particularly young girls, are dying younger.  If we can save lives - this drug can do that - we should urge the Minister to allow those children to get this drug.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#O00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I support the comments of Senator Buttimer.

I fully support the comments of my colleague Senator Buttimer.  To give an example in my local area, until recently we only had the equivalent of half a speech therapist covering the entire county.  I heard in the past 24 hours that the two occupational therapists there have now moved outside the area.

Things are at a drastic point within disability services.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to come to the House to discuss the allocation of home-school liaison officers.  In my home county, for example, there are six home-school liaison officers covering a large number of existing schools that are covered under DEIS, mainly in the town areas.  One of the schools has 534 pupils and one such position.  More than 60% of the population of the school is non-Irish, with 30 different nationalities.  Among all the schools in the county that are covered under DEIS, there is an absenteeism rate of between 18% and 20%.  The whole system in the county is at breaking point.  Several schools have been added in under the most recent allocation but the schools that were there previously are at breaking point.  Ballymahon Vocational School, which has 407 pupils, shares a home-school liaison officer with Roscommon Community College, which is located in another county.  The Minister needs to come to the House on this issue.  If we do not get the necessary intervention in education and get kids to school, we will pay in the long run.  I ask that the Minister be requested to come to the House to discuss this matter which is affecting schools across the country.  There is a particular issue in my county because there is a high percentage of non-Irish people living there, particularly in the county town, and that is leading to a very high absenteeism rate.

The Joint Committee on Disability Matters meets every Thursday morning but a Seanad sitting would shine a very large light on disability matters.  We could bring in representatives of all the focus and advocacy groups working in this area to talk about the many challenges.  Not least among these is the Government's disability capacity review published last year, which tells us in no uncertain terms exactly what is needed in the system as regards inputs between now and 2032.  We certainly do not come close to what is required.  As such, a debate in the House would be welcome.  I will ask for a special sitting, perhaps via the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.  We can have a conversation on what is the best way to proceed and invite all Senators to let us know who we should ask to attend.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan asked me to write a letter to the Minister for Health and I will do that today.  I ask her for information on the reasons 35 children have been excluded from the scheme for the Kaftrio drug.  This welcome scheme gives enormous hope to hundreds of people, particularly young people aged under 18, who are suffering from cystic fibrosis.  They need to have hope and be able to aspire to a normal quality of life.  If the Senator provides that information, I will write to the Minister.  Hopefully, with the support of all Senators, we can get all of the children included in the Kaftrio scheme.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher asked for a debate on the home care sector.  It is a bizarre situation in which we find ourselves.  For the ten years I have been a Member of these Houses, we have sought more hours because there is always a need for more hours.  As the Senator described, we know that keeping people in their own homes allows them to live longer, healthier and happier lives.  This year, we probably have more hours than are required in the system but we do not have the people to provide all those hours.  That is better than the problem of having no money to fund the hours.  We certainly need to talk about staff pay and conditions and ensure we resolve the problem as soon as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen asked me to find time to reintroduce his Bill and I can certainly do that.  As Members know, we have been using Thursday afternoons when there is no Government legislation to advance Private Members' legislation in the House.  That approach is working successfully.  Perhaps the Senator could restore his Bill to the Order Paper and I will happily facilitate it as soon as I can.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne very much welcomed the announcement that Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport Knock were the first airports to be awarded age-friendly status by the WHO this week.  That is a very welcome announcement.<\/p> <p>Senators Marie Byrne, Malcolm Byrne and Cummins spoke of the need for equality for consumers.  At the end of the day, consumers rather than the question of who provides the transport are what are important.  We have an inequality with regard to coach tourism and Expressway services as they cannot avail of the extra 20% discount in fares announced by the Minister for Transport a number of months ago.  That also applies to the adult student card that has been introduced.  I do not believe a private versus public scenario was ever envisaged but the matter needs to be sorted out now.<\/p> <p>To respond to Senator Maria Byrne, last Wednesday night during the debate on a cost-of-living motion, I asked for the 20% reduction in transport fares to be made permanent.  I am pleased to hear, and I know these are only whispers but they are obviously whispers with a purpose, that the 20% discount will be extended for at least another year.  That is very welcome.<\/p> <p>Senator Murphy congratulated the R&aacute;s winner, Daire Feeley, who is from Roscommon.  There must be something in the water in Roscommon as the county has enjoyed so much success lately.  I, too, congratulate Daire.  His exploits in cycling are a real feat.  It was wonderful to see pictures of him and his family smiling yesterday.<\/p> <p>Senator Murphy welcomed the ACRE scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture, his two Ministers of State and the Taoiseach yesterday.  An allocation of &euro;1.5 billion over five years has been provided for the new scheme.  Senator Boyhan referred to communication problems and I think they can be sorted out.  It is a worthwhile scheme.  Senator Murphy was right to encourage people to sign up to both the new scheme and the fodder scheme, for which I thank him.<\/p> <p>Senator Flynn asked me for a debate and yesterday, in my absence, she asked the Deputy Leader, Senator Chambers, for a debate.  It is likely that I will not be able to arrange a debate before the end of July but I will get her an update.  I will talk to the Minister's people today to find out exactly what the position is and update the Senator.<\/p> <p>Senator Flynn also asked for support for two pensioners who want to get back into the home in which they lived for 50 years.  I do not know all of the details but I will do whatever I can later today to help the Senator.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan spoke about the 206 Irish women who had to travel to the United Kingdom outside of the democratic decision Irish people made a number of years ago to introduce medical terminations in this country.  The review of the legislation will allow us all to have a proper debate and suggest changes.  Whether people are pro or anti the legislation and the way it has worked in the last number of years, everyone is entitled to a view.  That review must be completed sooner rather than later because some people still find themselves in traumatic situations.  We fought so hard for this and encouraged the Irish people to be as compassionate as they were.  This matter needs to be reflected upon.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan also mentioned something that is extremely practical.  The construction defects group will probably not have its report ready by the time we deliberate on the 2023 budget in September or October.  It makes sense, therefore, to make financial provision, as the Senator suggested.  I will pass on her suggestion to the Minister and get back to her.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised an issue that is news to me.  I am not a member of the committee in question and had not heard about the matter.  The Senator is right, and I am a little baffled.  I have tried to make inquiries since he raised the issue but I have not received a response.  I will follow up the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#P00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#P00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>As the Senator said, a decision will be made this afternoon.

He acknowledged that there is no pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.

It is important but I do not think it is controversial, which may explain why there is not a strong Opposition presence here.  I am pleased to present this Bill to the House. While technical, it is important legislation.  The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide for members of the Military Police to take and use DNA samples and other evidence for the purposes of its investigations, including outside the jurisdiction when Defence Forces personnel are deployed overseas.<\/p> <p>The Military Police, a service corps within the Defence Forces headed by the Provost Marshal, conducts criminal investigations concerning persons subject to military law.  The investigative capabilities of the Military Police are currently compromised by the lack of a comprehensive statutory basis for the taking of evidentiary samples.  This Bill will remedy this situation and enhance the capability of the Military Police to carry out its investigations of serious offences.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides that DNA samples may be taken when a person subject to military law is placed in service custody by the Military Police in connection with a relevant offence.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a DNA (Military Police) database system, to be administered by Forensic Science Ireland, to hold DNA profiles generated from DNA samples taken under this legislation. <\/p> <p>The Bill closely mirrors the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, which provides for the taking of DNA samples by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the establishment of a DNA database system with a view to assisting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of serious crime.  Some necessary adaptations were required to take account of the military environment.  However, the safeguards provided for in the 2014 Act regarding the taking of samples from persons have been incorporated in this Bill.  In other words, we are simply giving Military Police the same powers that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already has and uses.<\/p> <p>The Bill also sets out the other powers of the Military Police when a member of the Defence Forces is placed in service custody. These powers, including the power to search and take fingerprints, are similar to the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to a person who is arrested and detained.<\/p> <p>A feature of the Bill is that DNA profiles generated from samples obtained under this Bill may be compared with DNA profiles held on the DNA database established under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014.  The comparison will be carried out by Forensic Science Ireland.<\/p> <p>I now come to the detailed provisions of the Bill, which is divided into 12 Parts.  Part 1 includes standard provisions relating to the Short Title and definitions and clarifies the application of the Bill to a person subject to military law, including when any such person is for the time being outside the State or on board a ship or aircraft.<\/p> <p>Part 2 deals with the taking of samples from persons in the custody of the Military Police for entry onto the DNA (Military Police) database system, as well as the taking of intimate and non-intimate samples.  Any samples taken under this Part may only be taken in connection with the investigation of what is called a \"relevant offence\".  For the purposes of this Bill, this means an offence for which a person subject to military law may be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years or more, for example, serious assault or murder.  In other words, this is only being used in serious cases.  The results of the forensic testing of a sample taken under this Part, and any DNA profile generated from any such sample, may be used in court martial proceedings.  Provision is made for the retaking of samples in certain circumstances, such as where the original sample proves to be insufficient or is inadequately labelled.<\/p> <p>Section 12 specifies the persons who are authorised to take intimate samples.  Due to the nature of an intimate sample, the consent of the person in service custody must be obtained before any such sample is taken.  Section 13 deals with the inferences a court martial may draw from a refusal to consent, or a withdrawal of consent, to the taking of an intimate sample.<\/p> <p>Section 15 allows for the use of reasonable force in the taking of a non-intimate sample.  In other words, we are asking people to co-operate with a process, and if they do not, then a judge will draw a conclusion for that.  However, the use of this power is subject to a number of safeguards as specified in this section.  Specifically, the use of reasonable force must be authorised by a member of the Military Police not below the rank of commandant.  In addition, the taking of a sample pursuant to this section must be recorded by electronic or similar means.  The provisions of this Part are similar to the equivalent provisions in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, that is, they are the same standards the Garda applies.<\/p> <p>Part 3 deals with the taking of samples from Defence Forces personnel and other persons to ascertain whether such persons have contaminated a crime scene sample. <\/p> <p>Part 4 provides that the Military Police may request a person, referred to in the Bill as a \"volunteer\", to have a DNA sample taken from him or her for the purpose of generating a DNA profile in relation to the investigation of a particular offence against military law.  A volunteer may include a person who is a victim, or reasonably considered to be a victim, of the alleged offence which is being investigated by the Military Police.  The taking of a sample under this Part is subject to a number of safeguards, including a requirement to obtain the written consent of the volunteer.  Where a person subject to military law refuses to give consent to the taking of a sample under this Part, then that refusal shall not of itself constitute reasonable cause for a member of the Military Police to suspect that person of committing the offence concerned for the purpose of arresting and placing that person in service custody.<\/p> <p>Part 5 provides for the establishment by the director of Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, of a DNA (Military Police) database system.  The system, which will be similar to the DNA database system established under the Act of 2014, will be used to contain DNA profiles generated from DNA samples taken under this Bill.  The Part details the structure of the DNA (Military Police) database system, such as the various indexes which will be contained within the system.<\/p> <p>Section 30 sets out in detail the functions of the director of FSI arising under this Part.  Section 32 outlines the various comparisons that may be carried out by the director of FSI using DNA profiles entered onto the DNA (Military Police) database system, including comparisons with DNA profiles entered on the DNA database system established under the Act of 2014.<\/p> <p>Part 6 outlines the powers of the Military Police in relation to the collection of evidence, other than evidence collected under Part 2 of this Bill for the purposes of DNA testing, from a person arrested by the Military Police and placed in service custody.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Part 6 also has detailed provisions for the destruction, after specific time periods, of evidence obtained under section 34 and provides for the analysis of fingerprints taken from persons in service custody.<\/p><p>Part 7 deals with the destruction, after specific time periods, of samples taken for the purposes of the Military Police DNA database system and the removal from that database system of DNA profiles generated from such samples.  It also provides for the extension, in certain circumstances for the specific periods, of the retention period for such samples and associated DNA profiles. <\/p><p>Part 8 sets out the offences arising under this Bill and the penalties that may be imposed for such offences. <\/p><p>Part 9 provides that the Minister for Defence shall, not later than six years after commencement of this Bill, review the operation of certain aspects of Parts 6 and 7 of the Bill and thereafter conduct similar reviews at such times as the Minister considers appropriate.  Following any review, the Minister may, by ministerial order, reduce the period for the retention of evidence obtained under these Parts.  In other words, there are reviews built into this legislation.<\/p><p>Part 10 provides that the provost marshal shall, following consultation with Forensic Science Ireland, prepare a code of practice to provide practical guidance to members of the Military Police in relation to the taking of samples for DNA testing under this Bill.  This code of practice will help to ensure consistency in approach between this legislation and the 2014 Act.  This Part also includes miscellaneous provisions, such as the delegation by the provost marshal of the functions assigned to him or her under this Bill to members of the Military Police, the making of regulations for the taking of samples and procedures, and for the transmission of samples for forensic testing. <\/p><p>Part 11 sets out minor amendments to the Act of 2014 which are required on foot of this Bill.  The amendments have two principle purposes.  First, the functions of the DNA database system oversight committee established under Part 9 of the Act of 2014 will be extended to cover the Military Police DNA database system.  Second, amendments are being made to Part 12 of the Act of 2014 which implements, among other matters, the DNA and fingerprint data aspects of European Council Decision 2008\/615\/JHA, known as the Pr&uuml;m decision, into Irish law.  The Pr&uuml;m decision contains provisions concerned with the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration.  These amendments to the Act of 2014 apply the provisions contained in that Act regarding the reciprocal searching of DNA databases and automated fingerprint identification systems maintained by states for criminal investigation purposes to any DNA or fingerprint data obtained by the Military Police in the course of their investigations.  This is, in other words, sensible data sharing.  <\/p><p>Part 12 sets out technical amendments to the Defence Act 1954 and the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1983.  The primary purpose of these amendments is to provide that a summary court-martial may deal with applications concerning various matters arising under this Bill. <\/p><p>In conclusion, I am pleased to submit this technical but important legislation for the consideration of the House.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p><p>In short, this is just about applying the standards that the Garda currently uses to the Military Police to ensure that they can efficiently conduct investigations that, of course, respect people's privacy, but at the same time use DNA and a DNA database to good effect.  It makes a lot of sense.  For what it is worth, we did not have any amendments in the D&aacute;il on this issue.  There was, in general, cross-party support for what we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#S00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Before I start, I wish to welcome my colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, and her guests, Phyllis Quinn and Elenora Corneille.

This Bill will bring the Military Police in line with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It also applies to where a member of the Defence Forces is placed in service custody, quite similar again to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, it includes the sharing of information, DNA and fingerprints between EU member states.  As the Minister said, this is only used in serious cases.  It will enhance the structure between all the EU member states in fighting serious crime.  As has been said by many in the Lower House, this will be agreed by all sides and improve our capabilities to manage serious criminal activities.  On Fine Gael&rsquo;s behalf, I welcome this Bill.

I know her guests will be very well looked after on their visit to Leinster House.  I hope they have an enjoyable day.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive contribution on this legislation.  The principle purpose of the Bill, as he outlined, is to provide for members of the Military Policy to take and use DNA samples and other evidence for the purposes of their investigations, including outside the jurisdiction when Defence Forces personnel are deployed overseas. <\/p> <p>While technical, this is important legislation.  It is required to ensure there is a comprehensive statutory basis for the collection of forensic evidence by the Military Police to assist them in their investigations.  This includes investigations that may be required to be carried out in other jurisdictions where members of the Defence Forces are deployed overseas.  <\/p> <p>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 does not, as the Minister outlined, provide for the activities of the Military Police.

The investigative capability of the Military Police is currently compromised by the lack of a comprehensive statutory basis for taking evidentiary samples.  This Bill will remedy this situation and enhance the capability of the Military Police to carry out its investigations of serious offences, similar to the power currently available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this regard, the Bill also sets out, as the Minister outlined, the other powers of a member of the Military Police when a member of the Defence Forces is placed in custody.  These powers, including the power to search and take fingerprints, are similar to the powers of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to a person who is arrested and detained.  <\/p> <p>The Military Police are responsible for the prevention and investigation of offences, the enforcement of discipline and the general policing of the Defence Forces.  They also enjoy a very close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other statutory agencies at national and local levels.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assists in providing specialist police training to the Military Police in the field of crime investigation.  <\/p> <p>This Bill was first introduced at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in October 2019, but unfortunately it lapsed with the fall of that Government.

This Bill significantly enhances the powers of the Military Police and brings them in line with the powers of the Garda in respect of DNA collection and fingerprinting of suspects.  It should also be borne in mind that the Garda is operationally independent when carrying out investigations.  The Military Police, however, remains part of the military chain of command and cannot be considered truly independent.  The commission on the Defence Forces recommended that the Military Police become independent of the operational chain of command and that robust and independent oversight and complaints mechanisms be introduced.<\/p><p>I understand a couple of Government amendments were passed on Committee Stage limiting the purposes for which the DNA database can be used and to introduce a code of practice for the taking of DNA samples.  I welcome this technical Bill to the Seanad.  We all want crimes to be investigated properly and for those who have committed crimes to be brought to justice.  This Bill will help to ensure the Military Police is able to do that.<\/p><p>As always, there needs to be a balance between the effective investigation of crimes and respecting rights to data protection and privacy of those whose DNA is taken.  In respect of the threshold of the crime, according to the Bill, samples are only taken for offences for which a person subject to military law may be punished by imprisonment for a period of five years or more, for example, serious assault or murder.  The Minister moved that the Bill be read a Second Time and unreservedly commended it to the House.  If it is so good and since it is so non-controversial, why is there a cut-off point that it cannot deal with less serious offences as well?  There might be crimes that are serious in the eyes of a person but that fall short of that specified term of imprisonment of five years or more.<\/p><p>I have a question about one of the amendments made on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in respect of the code of practice. One of the issues we have run into in some legislation is that codes of practice are non-statutory and have less importance than statutory codes of practices.  Will the Minister confirm this a statutory code of practice?  I acknowledge the code of practice would have to be approved by the Minister.  It may be useful if the code of practice were to be sent to the committee for comment before the Minister was to grant approval or refusal.  The main body for consultation on that code of practice is Forensic Science Ireland.  Would the Minister be open to including the committee as a named body to be consulted under this legislation?<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for making himself available.  I just learned a few minutes ago from Senator Wilson that he was in a different country this morning.  His dedication to coming into the Seanad is second to none.  We appreciate the presence of the senior Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Bill is technical and non-controversial.  I am pleased the Green Party is happy to support it.  My observations were not meant as criticisms.  They are just enquiries and the Minister might revert to me at a time of his convenience through his Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#T00600","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire, an Teachta Coveney.

He will know from being at the Council of Europe that I am a few Senators down this week.  It is one of those days of running from one thing to the other.  We welcome the Bill.  In effect, it is the adoption of a code of practice with respect to the use of forensic evidence in the gathering of evidence in circumstances where military personnel are suspected of certain offences under military law.  It is also to provide for the establishment and operation by Forensic Science Ireland of the Department of Justice of a DNA (Military Police) database system.  It is an important development in the ongoing process of modernising the Defence Forces, the means it employs to gather evidence and the rules which govern this.  It is important the Minister is able to give an undertaking, because of the difficulties with recruitment and retention within the Defence Forces, that there will be sufficient resources available within the Military Police to ensure the detail contained in the roll-out of this Bill can be put into effect practically on the ground.<\/p> <p>My colleague, Deputy John Brady, supported this Bill on Committee Stage but he also raised concerns that there is no set period to cover arrests and detention periods within the Defence Forces.  This is an area of concern that requires attention in the time ahead.  There are currently no stipulations regarding the extension of arrest periods, or who has the authority to extend these periods.  There is a need for further amendments to the Defence Act to bring this up to the standard of other areas of military law.  While we are debating the Bill, will the Minister update us on the commission on the future of the Defence Forces and when he thinks he will be able to take it before this House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#U00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for being both helpful and co-operative.

This legislation is technical.  It is effectively ensuring investigations undertaken by the Military Police can be as comprehensive, using DNA samples in the way the Garda uses DNA samples in other criminal cases.  It would be extraordinary if there were investigations taking place under military law that could lead to a court martial that could not use modern forms of evidence gathering and so on.  Of course, there are limitations to that.  Certainly, the taking of intimate samples is only justifiable in cases of serious breaches of the law.  There is a voluntary nature as well in respect of willingness to give a sample in certain circumstances, as is deemed appropriate.<\/p> <p>Senators referred to other issues in respect of Military Police investigations around oversight, appeals mechanisms and so on, some of which were dealt with the commission report.  Those issues do not require legislation at this point.  This is about providing a legal basis for the taking of DNA samples, which at the moment we do not have.  That is why it is a specific technical piece that mirrors what the Garda can do and updates the various Acts that need to be updated in that regard.<\/p> <p>On the commission report, we are in the middle of discussions with other key Departments on ensuring we can bring a series of recommendations to Government that can be agreed.  That is not an easy process, as those Senators who have been in government before will know.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are proposing a significant increase in expenditure for the Defence Forces, which is absolutely justified and necessary.  We have the evidence base now to make informed, sensible decisions on the resourcing of our Defence Forces into the future.  We also have the extraordinary and tragic context of a war on the Continent of Europe, which unfortunately is seeing somewhere between 200 and 400 people dying every day.  Every country in the European Union is reviewing defence and security issues and we should be no different.  The fact that we are militarily neutral and non-aligned does not protect us from some of these threats, including cyberattacks, and we know that.  We are going to respond in a comprehensive way but consultation with other Departments is needed.  That is happening and has been happening for a number of weeks now.  I thank my colleagues for their co-operation because this is not easy stuff in terms of trying to accommodate a significant financial request, given the pressures on Government around the cost of living, healthcare, housing, disability services, education and so many other areas.  <\/p><p>In response to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question, I hope to have it done before the recess.  I gave a commitment that I would try to bring a memo for agreement to Government in the month of June and I would like to follow through on that if it is possible.  Whether it happens next week or the week after is not really the issue.  The main issue here is to get it right and to get a clear commitment so that we can set a course for the Defence Forces of reform, modernisation, recruitment, effective retention, growth, expansion and increased numbers.  Of course, increased resources will be needed for all of that and we cannot do this overnight.  We cannot do it in one, two or even three years.  This is about setting a course for quite some time into the future, hopefully with some certainty around the availability of resources so that we can map out the four- to six-year plans that are needed in terms of upgrading equipment in the Defence Forces within the rules and the law and so on.  This simply cannot be done overnight.  <\/p><p>As Minister for Defence, I do not want to create expectations but we are very close to the most strategic defence memo that I can remember coming to Government, in terms of its scope, scale and commitment.  I hope we will get agreement on that shortly so that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces can work together to bring about the modernisation and reform that is badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#U00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655888400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#V00300","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#V00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

As the Minister of State knows, the two amendments are similar in nature.  They are very similar to what was moved by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, in the D&aacute;il.  The purposes of the amendments are broadly similar.  They recognise the new powers that will be conferred on the commission on passing the legislation.  This will mean the workload will increase.  The concern is that unless money is provided to reflect the increased workload important work will not be done, to the point that it would affect the organisation's ability to carry out necessary functions.  We have tabled the amendments because we need to have a belt, braces and baler twine approach to ensure the commission has all of the resources it needs.  New powers are welcome but they are effectively useless without the capacity of the organisation to back it up.

They were proposed by Deputy O'Reilly during the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il.  I gave them considerable consideration at that time.  I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy O'Reilly and the Senators who have proposed these amendments that it is important that any regulatory body be adequately resourced to coincide with any necessary legislative provisions that give it additional powers.  The Department and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, recognise that significant adequate additional resources will be required to implement this new legislation.  In the past two budgets alone, the CCPC has received an increase of more than 30%.  At present it has 146 staff and it intends to increase this to more than 200 by the end of this year.<\/p> <p>If the commission's assessment is that additional funding is required based on the structures included in the Bill, it can submit an increased Estimate bid as part of the budget 2023 negotiations.  Such a bid is subject to agreement by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  If approved, it would be incorporated into the overall departmental Estimates package that will be subject to negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for budget 2023.  The Senator's amendment would set an unusual departure from this process whereby past spending would have to be accounted for rather than projected spending.  If the budgets in 2017 and 2018 had been based on the past performance the CCPC would not have received the additional 30% for 2021 and 2022.  In fact, those budgets were based on future projections.  The Government is obliged under EU law to ensure its competition authorities are sufficiently resourced.<\/p> <p>When Deputy O'Reilly tabled these amendments in the D&aacute;il, I looked further into the matter, particularly on what options would be available to the CCPC if it were to find itself under-resourced at a future date and unable to carry out its functions.  I consulted with the commission and I have been advised that if such an event were to occur it has the ability to contact the European Commission's DG Competition directly.  The CCPC has direct contact with the Commission's officials in the appropriate unit.  This would be likely to be the first point of contact if it were to have concerns about future funding.  This means the CCPC has recourse if a future government were not to adequately resource the commission or, as Deputy O'Reilly said on Report Stage, if a future government decided to slash it.<\/p> <p>While I appreciate the concerns underpinning the amount and the importance of ensuring that the CCPC is able to effectively carry out its functions, I believe we have safeguards in place.  What is more, I believe we have demonstrated this in the past two years.  Even in advance of the legislation being enacted, in preparation for the new powers coming on board we have allocated an additional 30%.  We are supporting the CCPC to increase its headcount from 146 to in excess of 200 later this year.  I cannot support the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#CC00700","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Before I come to my response, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the members of the north Belfast and Lurgan community restorative justice harm reduction group who are in the Gallery.

I too would like to acknowledge Councillor Dolan in the Gallery.<\/p> <p>At its heart, this Bill is about the need for fair and open competition for our businesses, economy and society.  We know the vast majority of businesses do not engage in uncompetitive practices, but there are some which do.  These practices drive out competition, drive up costs for ordinary citizens and undermine the dynamic nature of our economy.  That is why I prioritised this Bill as soon as I took office and was determined to bring it before the Oireachtas.  I sincerely thank the Senators for their overall support for the Bill to date and the time they have taken to engage in-depth with legislation that, by necessity, is long and legally complex.<\/p> <p>While enacting the Competition (Amendment) Bill involves meeting our obligations as a member of the European Union, it is about much more than just that.  It is about ensuring that Ireland's citizens are protected.  This Government is committed to taking a tough stance on white-collar crime and ensuring our regulatory bodies have effective powers and are effectively resourced.<\/p> <p>As I said, most businesses operate in a fair and honourable manner.  We have an obligation to those businesses to deal effectively and efficiently with anti-competitive practices in order that law-abiding businesses can thrive.  Competition benefits all consumers and drives innovation and efficiencies.  These efficiencies can be passed onto consumers in the context of competitive pricing.<\/p> <p>I thank Senators again for their positive reception of the Bill.

The statement includes an overview of Ireland's climate change mitigation and adaptation policy measures, including specific updates for the various sectors designated in the 2015 Act.  The 2020 Annual Transition Statement also sets out a record of greenhouse gas emissions from the most recent inventory prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency and projections of future emissions, together with a report on the State's compliance with its obligations under EU law and international agreements.<\/p> <p>While the 2020 Annual Transition Statement must predominately contain information in respect of 2019, it also records more recent policy developments in relation to climate mitigation and adaptation.  This strengthened climate governance framework provided for under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 means annual transition statements are now replaced by climate action plans and long-term climate strategies, supported by a system of carbon budgeting and sectoral targets with appropriate oversight by Government, the Oireachtas and the Climate Change Advisory Council.  Therefore, this will be the final annual transition statement.<\/p> <p>To give a brief overview of the various development and policy measures adopted to mitigate and reduce emissions, I will highlight some of the key items included within the 2020 Annual Transition Statement.  The above mentioned 2021 climate Act was signed into law in July 2021, setting Ireland on a legally binding path to net zero emissions not later than 2050, and to a 51% reduction in emissions, relative to 2018 levels, by the end of this decade.  To deliver on the ambition set out in the Act, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021 last November.  The plan includes policies and measures in every sector to bring about the significant changes needed to transform our society and to meet our climate ambition for 2030 and beyond.<\/p> <p>The 2021 climate Act establishes a system of carbon budgeting as a key element of a strengthened legislative framework.  In April, after an extensive consultation process, a programme of carbon budgets was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and thus came into effect.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently preparing the sectoral emissions ceilings for Government approval in the coming weeks.  This process has included extensive engagement with all relevant Departments and agencies.<\/p> <p>Carbon pricing is a key pillar of Ireland's overall decarbonisation strategy.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 reiterates the Government's commitment to carbon pricing playing a key role in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The 2020 Finance Act sets a statutory trajectory for carbon prices in Ireland, with these set to rase an additional &euro;9.5 billion in revenue by 2030.  This revenue is being allocated to programmes that support sustainability and those most vulnerable to rising costs.  This includes &euro;5 billion for energy efficient retrofits, &euro;3 billion to address fuel poverty and a just transition, as well as &euro;1.5 billion to promote sustainable agriculture practices.<\/p> <p>In terms of the electricity generation sector, the 2020 Annual Transition Statement highlights progress made while also noting our increasing ambition, with a target of 80% of our energy to come from renewable sources by 2030.  This fundamental shift will require major changes to the electricity generation mix, transmission and distribution grids alongside significant changes to our national demand profiles and storage capacity.  The statement identifies measures adopted and progress made across a number of areas including via the renewable electricity support scheme, the enactment of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021, ongoing work to develop a new offshore renewable energy development plan, and efforts to support microgeneration and small-scale solar.  The 2020 statement also highlighted ongoing work to enhance our electricity interconnection and upgrade our electricity grid, with &euro;4 billion allocated for capital investment over the period 2021 to 2025.<\/p> <p>With regard to the enterprise sector, the statement notes that approximately 68% of enterprise emissions are accounted for under the EU's emissions trading system, ETS.  Reforms to the ETS, such as those proposed in the 2019 European Green Deal, seek to ensure the ETS can effectively deliver reductions in emissions while addressing the challenges faced by sectors most exposed to international competition.  The statement lists progress made in the sector through a number of the measures to meet our 2030 targets.  These measures have included the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment engaging with representatives of the cement sector to identify opportunities for further introduction of alternative fuel sources, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland introducing strategies that focus on decarbonisation and sustainability, the launch of the ClimateToolKit4Business website, the extension of the accelerated capital allowance scheme for energy efficient equipment, and the introduction of the disruptive technologies innovation fund and the climate enterprise action fund.  Furthermore, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, continues to support the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial and industrial heat users not covered by the ETS through the support scheme for renewable heat.<\/p> <p>In our built environment, the statement provides updates on progress made to decarbonise our commercial buildings with a range of supports and funding.  In addition, support was provided to our SMEs through the excellence in energy efficient design, EXEED, programme to provide energy savings and emissions reductions.  Our public sector is looking to lead by example in increasing the energy efficiency of its activities and buildings with the public sector energy efficiency programme, led by the SEAI, providing comprehensive support and engagement to guide public bodies to achieve their energy efficiency targets.  The annual statement also notes how the Climate Action Plan 2021 supports measures to develop our district heating potential and to ensure our retrofit ambitions align with the Housing for All strategy in areas such as compact growth, nearly zero energy buildings and retrofitting.<\/p> <p>The 2020 Annual Transition Statement details how our transport sector is playing a significant role in the national mitigation effort.  The decarbonisation pathway in transport is multilayered and will primarily focus on shifting to more sustainable transport modes, reducing the overall number of kilometres driven by fossil fuel-powered cars, accelerating the electrification of road transport, and an increased use of biofuels.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A number of key public transport projects have been progressed to enhance and expand the capacity of the network and provide viable alternatives to private car travel.  This includes 261 new buses delivered in 2021, with progress also made on delivering BusConnects in Dublin and Cork, as well as the launch of the National Transport Authority's Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan, which will seek to provide better connections between villages and towns through enhanced and new local routes.<\/p><p>A low-emission vehicle task force was established to accelerate the deployment of low-carbon transport technologies and a national electric vehicle charging infrastructure strategy is in development to prioritise the delivery of fast and rapid-charge point infrastructure over the next five years.  Each local authority has been mandated to develop active travel routes that will improve the level of safety and attractiveness of using active travel modes in rural towns and villages.  An additional 248 staff were allocated across the 31 local authorities and national roads offices to assist with the delivery of the significantly increased number of projects.  The launch of the sustainable mobility policy in April set out the framework to deliver at least 500,000 additional daily active travel and public transport journeys by 2030 and a 10% reduction in the number of kilometres driven by fossil-fuelled cars.<\/p><p>The freight sector, which is critical to economic activity on an island economy, is heavily dependent on imported oil.  The Department of Transport is developing a ten-year strategy for the haulage sector focused on improving efficiencies and standards and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  In November 2021, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy, which sets out the pathway for increasing the supply and use of renewable fuels in transport, including extending the biofuel obligation to 2024.<\/p><p>The 2020 annual transition statement highlights a number of developments in terms of how our agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, sector is committing to reducing its emissions.  The sector will also contribute by reducing land-based emissions through managing our soils in a better way.  Food Vision, launched in August 2021, is a landmark for the Irish agrifood sector and has the potential to transform the agriculture, food, forestry and marine sectors, with sustainability at its core.  The strategy is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead and, crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions.<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has overseen a number of programmes and initiatives to support the farming community in adopting and expanding sustainable practices.  This has included collaboration with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the nitrates action programme.  The most recent iteration of this programme will seek to contribute to a number of measures, including reducing chemical nitrogen use, establishing a national fertiliser register, reducing crude protein content of livestock feed and upskilling farmers and advisers to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to implement climate mitigation, biodiversity enhancement and adaptation practices.<\/p><p>Other initiatives and programmes to support cost savings and more efficient and sustainable farming have included: the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme to support a range of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies at farm level; the young farmer capital investment scheme; the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme; and the agricultural catchments programme, which will significantly enhance the monitoring of impacts of agriculture on our environment.  Further work is also ongoing on the promotion of protected urea fertilisers.<\/p><p>There has been significant improvement in grant and premium rates for the forestry for fibre scheme, which has been extended to the end of 2022.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is currently preparing a new forest strategy that will continue to take into account the important role forest biomass will play in climate change mitigation and adaptation.  Furthermore, in 2020, &euro;79.2 million of capital expenditure was invested in forestry development, including afforestation, the mobilisation of private timber resources, substantial investment in forest roads, continued support for knowledge transfer groups and the promotion of timber products.<\/p><p>The 2020 annual transition statement also highlights our ongoing work on climate adaptation to address current and future risks posed by a changing climate.  Ireland&rsquo;s robust adaptation strategies will also have positive co-benefits through fostering green growth, innovation, jobs, ecosystem enhancement and improvements in water and air quality.  Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory national adaptation framework represents Ireland's current national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change.  It identifies 12 key sectors requiring sectoral adaptation plans, and these plans were approved by the Government and published in October 2019.  I will briefly mention some of these plans.<\/p><p>The agriculture, forest and seafood adaptation plan aims to reduce climate risk and build resilience through awareness-raising and integrating adaptation planning.  Progress on implementation has been made both within the Department and externally.  Work has continued to raise the profile of adaptation by aligning the mitigation and adaptation reporting processes together.<\/p><p>Actions within this biodiversity sectoral adaptation plan build on the foundations of the national biodiversity action plan.  These actions are aimed at  improving sustainable agriculture and fisheries, better soil and land management and, most urgently, the restoration of natural systems.  This adaptation plan will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with oversight by the biodiversity working group and the Minister.<\/p><p>Climate change can also cause major infrastructural damage to transport networks, as well as disruptions to operations and unsafe travel conditions.  The adaptation plan for transport infrastructure identifies key risks in the area and serves as a step towards building Ireland's long-term vision of a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable and resilient transport sector by 2050.  The energy and gas networks adaptation plan seeks to identify options that will help build resilience against the impacts of climate change and in assessing our vulnerability to likely climate impacts on our electricity and gas networks.<\/p><p>As noted by the Climate Change Advisory Council annual review of 2021, good progress is being made in implementing the sectoral adaptation plan for flood risk management.  The long-term goal for climate adaptation for flooding and flood risk management is to promote sustainable communities and support our environment through the effective management of the potential impacts of climate change.<\/p><p>The adaptation plan for the water quality and water services infrastructure presents an assessment of key future climate risks to the sectors.  The plan outlines the measures available to build resilience against the effects of climate change and weather-related events and other socioeconomic developments in both sectors.  Under the national adaptation framework, each local authority was required to make and adopt a local adaptation strategy.  Whereas implementation of each strategy is a matter for each individual local authority, a progress reporting template was developed by the climate action regional offices to enable local authorities to report on their progress.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently working with the regional offices, the Environmental Protection Agency and other stakeholders to develop appropriate guidelines for the making of local authority climate action plans, which are required under the Climate Act 2021.  Another key development noted in the 2020 annual report is Ireland&rsquo;s climate information platform, Climate Ireland, being introduced on a phased basis under the EPA research programme as a \"one-stop shop\" of information, data and knowledge to support those preparing for and adapting to the consequences of climate change.<\/p><p>The 2020 annual transition statement refers to the EPA's provisional greenhouse gases emissions report for 2019, emissions and projections for 2020 to 2040.  However, as there are now more up-to-date figures available, I will provide a brief overview of these.  In November 2021, the EPA reported that for 2020, total emissions in Ireland were estimated to have declined by roughly 3.6% compared with 2019.  This reduction was driven by a drop in the use of peat for electricity generation and Covid-19's impact on transport.  In this period our energy sector saw an almost 8% reduction in emissions while transport fell by almost 16%.  In the same period, agriculture emissions increased by 1.4% and emissions from the residential sector rose by 9%, highlighting the need for retrofitting to decarbonise home heating.  This relatively small overall reduction, given the substantial impact Covid-19 has had on our society, further highlights the transformative nature of the measures required to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets.<\/p><p>In May of this year, the EPA released its emissions projections out to 2040.  These projections estimate that in 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s emissions rose by 6% compared with 2020, in some part driven by our emergence from Covid-19 and associated restrictions.  The EPA also estimated that we were not on course to meet our 2030 targets, although its modelling could not fully factor in all actions and measures in our climate action plan, given further technical details are still to be developed.<\/p><p>We must consider how to accelerate the delivery of measures and actions that can not only reduce our emissions but also support new ways of conducting business and encouraging innovation.  Achieving these targets will provide numerous benefits to the country in terms of health, competitiveness, employment opportunities, biodiversity and climate impact.  To reverse the current trajectory of emissions and to meet our targets, a significant shift is required in the speed at which we roll out the measures and actions that will decarbonise our economy.  As part of the process to deliver the next climate action plan, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will engage with other Departments and State agencies to identify opportunities for accelerating our climate action.<\/p><p>As a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, Ireland is required to report regularly on its implementation of the convention, preparing and submitting a national communication every four years and a biennial report every two years.  Ireland submitted its seventh national communication and third biennial report in March 2018.  Ireland submitted its fourth biennial report in February 2020.  We are currently preparing our eighth national communication for submission.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s national reports are subject to an in-country technical review process and a multilateral assessment process.  Ireland participated in multilateral assessments by the UNFCCC on its seventh national communication in Bonn in June 2019.  The technical review of Ireland&rsquo;s fourth biennial report took place virtually in April 2020 and multilateral assessment also took place virtually in June 2021.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The transition to a carbon-neutral economy will provide huge opportunities to foster innovation, create new jobs and grow businesses in areas such as offshore wind, cutting-edge sustainable agriculture and low-carbon construction.<\/p><p>Finally, while we all must act together and work towards our climate objective, I realise that the costs of climate action will be more acutely felt by some than by others.  As a Government, we are committed to protecting those most vulnerable and ensuring a just transition to a low-carbon economy.

I am going to talk about the last point that he made about the impact that climate change is having on the most vulnerable and I will talk about our global responsibilities.<\/p> <p>I was involved in negotiations on the programme for Government when it came to foreign affairs.  Of particular importance to me was the sense that we need to ramp things up when it comes to our global responsibilities.  I wish to make three points.  The first relates to the overseas development aid, ODA, budget, which I will come back to.  The second is climate finance and the increased commitment by the Government, and in particular the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, at the Conference of the Parties or COP26 last year.  Where are we with that?  Third, we must our seat on the UN Security Council for climate action reasons.  I doubt whether that is what is happening and, therefore, I would like some evidence and transparency across government as to how we are using our seat.<\/p> <p>It is important that we, in this Chamber, discuss our global responsibilities because famines can seem far removed from the everyday life experiences of all of us.  I realise that we all have struggles and all of our constituents have struggles but Ireland is one the richest countries in the world in terms of what is in the budget pot.  That is why I want to ensure the budget is used effectively to help the poorest people in the world.<\/p> <p>Greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland are 54 times that of Somalia.  Right now, the Horn of Africa is in crisis.  Up to this point, one in five children under the age of five dies from malnutrition on this planet, which we are all here to protect wherever we live.  Those of us who live in the richest part of the world, and those of us who generate high emissions, have a greater responsibility to protect those children.  Tr&oacute;caire and D&oacute;chas, in particular, have suggested to us that 350,000 children are likely to die on the Horn of Africa this summer.  Even to think of one child dying from malnutrition is devastating and, therefore, we cannot, as a Government, turn a blind eye as we know the reality for these people.<\/p> <p>These statements afford us an opportunity to mention all aspects of climate change and I have decided to talk about this issue today because I want to act as a spokesperson in this Chamber for D&oacute;chas and Tr&oacute;caire, thus ensuring that their message is conveyed.  Last week, I appeared on television with Ms Caoimhe de Barra and I gave a commitment then that I would present their budget submission.  They seek an additional &euro;233 million in budget 2023 to put us on the path to our ODA target.  As the Minister of State will know as he was in the room with me when we negotiated, we made sure that the programme for Government contained a commitment to get us to 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, by 2030 and we are still way off our target.  Even with an increased budget of &euro;176 million in 2021 that only brings us to 0.32%.  We are way off and need to do much better in budget 2023.  Climate finance has doubled and the commitment of this Government is recognised by these organisations.  Let us make sure that we convey the message loud and clear that this must be a reality.  By 2025, we will reach &euro;225 million per year in climate finance and, therefore, finance must be stepped up in the next budget.<\/p> <p>The region comprising Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia is experiencing its fourth consecutive rainy season in a row and it is likely to be the worst on record.  How can we deal with that?  Number one is everything that the Minister of State has outlined.  The reason the Green Party went into government is changes must be made in the countries that emit the most.  It is important to note that 10% of the richest countries emit 52% of greenhouse gas emissions.  Tackling climate change is a massive job and cannot be done just by Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia.  We must all tackle climate change and we, in the Green Party, take that responsibility seriously.<\/p> <p>The other part is adaptation.  We must ensure that we have the finance and assist people to move beyond where they are now.  When people live in a country on the Equator and cannot rely on seasons they have no ability, no back-up and no economy that can ensure they can put food on the table.  We can all now see the crisis in trying to get grain out of Ukraine, which has an impact on us.  We talk about farmers and the deep impact inflicted when grain does not reach the agricultural sector and farmers here.  However, such a situation has the greatest impact on the people who live in extreme poverty and suffer malnutrition, which is those in Africa.  That is why we have an obligation to bring Ukrainians to this country because they must flee a war but we must also deal with the knock-on global impacts on the most vulnerable people in the world.<\/p> <p>Finally, I thank the Minister of State for this opportunity to raise these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#LL00500","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her timely delivery of her words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#LL00600","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I will try to stay within the allocated time as well.<\/p><p>Having listened to Senator O'Reilly and the Minister of State, I was struck by their eloquence and the importance of what they have said, particularly what the former said about the most vulnerable people in the world.  I empathise deeply with what they have said but I find myself feeling that there are things that I must say here because they are the truth and hence I feel a need to put them on the record.<\/p><p>Today is the feast day of St. Thomas More, who is the patron saint of statesmen and politicians.  His name is synonymous with the strength of his conscience and for speaking his mind instead of just going along with the crowd.  I have all of that in mind when I say that there are things sometimes that one feels the need to say that one would rather not say but one must as one thinks they are true.  St. Thomas More once wrote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBy applying a remedy to one sore, you provoke another.  That which removes one ill symptom, produces others. <\/blockquote> <p>That observation could be made about our climate policy at the moment.  In addressing the serious running sore of climate change and carbon emissions, we are spawning a growing list of other problems, which, in turn, damages both the effectiveness of measures taken and public support, which is also important.<\/p><p>Our targets for environmental policies have a tendency to be unachievable and, therefore, we should focus our limited resources on ways to protect the people who are most at risk from climate change such as those who live in coastal communities.  I find myself much more sympathetic to the comments that have been made about adaptation rather than about mitigation.  Let us consider the task of cutting Irish carbon emissions by 51% by 2030.  If we are honest, is that not wildly optimistic?  Is it something that sounds good on a poster?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In 2020, it was acknowledged that the two main Government parties agreed to it just to get the current coalition agreement over the line.  One does not need to be a climatologist or a mathematician to see that reaching the target would require very deep cuts to all areas of society, particularly agriculture.  It seems to me that the EPA has now effectively confirmed that the target is a pipe dream, even if it does not say it out loud.  We see that emissions rose by 6% in 2021, despite at least an 8% fall year-on-year being needed to reach the 2030 target.  The EPA says that the urgent implementation of \"all climate plans and policies, plus further new measures\" will be needed to meet the target.  That statement by the EPA will send chills down the spine of people struggling to pay their ESB bills and to fill their cars.<\/p><p>Let us look at other targets.  Is the target of 1 million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030 not completely unrealistic?  Surely it will be missed.  Electric vehicles are very expensive, and those who can afford them are currently on waiting lists to get them.  We want to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 680,000 heat pumps, and this at a time when tradesmen and women are desperately needed to construct new homes, and people are waiting weeks or months for an electrician or plumber to do small jobs.  It seems to me that we simply cannot afford to do all of it at the one time, and something is going to have to give.  That is what I mean by saying, by treating one sore we seem to create others.<\/p><p>On oil, we must be willing to accept the fact that regardless of how quickly we change, Ireland is going to be dependent on fossil fuels for many years and decades to come.  There are moral, as well as economic, considerations to make.  President Biden is travelling to Saudi Arabia next month to ask the Saudis to increase oil production to try to push down international prices.  Rather than allowing new exploration within the United States, he would prefer to import it from the Gulf, with all the issues around human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, not to mention the carbon cost of transporting oil, which his policy raises.  It seems to me that this is the ridiculous and almost morally bankrupt pass to which climate policy has brought the United States.<\/p><p>I wonder whether we are following a similar policy in Ireland.  We have banned any new licences for oil exploration, preferring instead to depend on costly imports from abroad, which have a higher carbon cost.  Where is the sense in that?  A third of our gas comes from the Corrib field, which will be gone within the decade, but by then our use of gas will not decrease by a third, which means we will need to find new sources of imported gas.  While we are adopting renewables, should we not try to utilise new domestic sources that may exist, such as the Barryroe field off west Cork, instead of relying more and more on questionable sources of oil from abroad?  I worry that we are cutting off our nose to spite our face.<\/p><p>The phrase \"just transition\" is regularly used in discussing this issue, but what does it even mean?  There are no climate measures which do not involve very unjust outcomes for some people, in terms of their lifestyles or their pockets.  Rightly or wrongly, large sections of rural Ireland believe that an urban Dublin-based elite is intent on waging war on the way they live their lives.  This is corroding public support for necessary environmental policies.  Nowhere is that more evident than in relation to the carbon tax.  Surely the entire basis of that tax has been wiped by the soaring cost of fossil fuels in recent months.  Although it may be small, what moral basis do we have for expecting people to pay it at a time of soaring fossil fuel prices, while expecting them to support climate-change policies generally?  The carbon tax is treating one sore but creating others.<\/p><p>Even worse, is the surreal fact that VAT is charged on the carbon tax, which is effectively a tax on a tax.  How on earth is this justifiable?  That raises a further question about the injustice of charging VAT on electricity bills.  VAT is designed to tax luxury items.  Electricity is not a luxury item.  In this day and age, it is absolutely necessary for people to live.  VAT is a competence of the EU as I understand it, but I find it impossible to fathom how all that is morally justified.<\/p><p>I realise that most of what I have said is very easy to say.  It is easy to be the Cassandra, the person heralding disaster, who says that this is not going to work.  What I am getting at is that there needs to be integrity not just in our policies but in our communications about policies.  We need to continue to soul-search as to how much of what we are talking about as being among our goals is realistic and how much of it will happen.  My strong belief is that there is a certain amount of undesirable outcomes that we simply must accept at this stage and that we must focus our effort much more on supporting the most vulnerable people in the world, who will be most at risk from things that are going to happen in the area of climate change.  I greatly fear that it simply is not in our capacity to bring about some of the changes that are being talked about.  Rather than adopting a set of unrealistic targets as dogma and denouncing those who might question them as deniers of one kind or another, we need to be realistic about what we can do to prevent climate change, given our small size and our limited resources.  What we do must be done in a way that garners support from the public at large, and not their resentment and hostility, which I am sorry to say, I increasingly observe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#LL00700","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive statement.  At the outset, the Chair opined that he had gone well over time, which helps all of us, because it means he has covered most of the bases.  I listened with interest to the two previous speakers, two people for whom I have great respect.  They both spoke about the social justice aspect of climate change and also the concerns Senator Mullen rightly identified.<\/p> <p>I am reminded of the old saying that it is impossible to make an omelette without breaking eggs.  The reality is that unless we dismantle the structure that we have become dependent on, we are not going to reach a point where we are going to respect the climate for future generations.  How we do that is really at issue.  I take the point that both speakers made on the necessity to ensure that those who will feel the greatest impact from the actions we must take must be protected to the greatest extent possible.  Ireland has done that well through successive Governments and over the generations.  Our social protection code, by comparison with others throughout the world, is very good.  Of course, it could be better.  I accept there are issues.  We must ensure that, as we make the changes, we are mindful of the people who will be impacted the most.<\/p> <p>Going back ten or 12 years, I was probably one of the more lonely voices in this House when I talked about climate change and the necessity to address it.  At that stage, it was a debate for environmentalists or academics, although I did not come from either background, but I saw the necessity to address the issue then.  It was not something that was discussed by the public when the Minister of State's colleague, Roger Garland, was elected as the first Green Party representative to the D&aacute;il.  People again took the view that it was more to do with dogs fouling the walkways around D&uacute;n Laoghaire that had attracted such a popular vote for respect for the environment rather than fully understanding what he was talking about.  Things have moved on and climate change is discussed everywhere now - in the pub by elderly people, in the playground by children, and in colleges and schools by the young.  They are demanding us as politicians to change the way we do business.  Like most matters, the public are well ahead of us.<\/p> <p>We have got to move from what the academics and environmentalists would have had as their mantra, which was all about stopping and what we could not and should not do any more.  We must look to the opportunities that exist in climate change.  There are significant opportunities to do things right and in a respectful way.  That is the case with agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, announced a significant budget yesterday of &euro;1.5 billion, under the ACRES programme, to do agriculture in a more sustainable way that is sympathetic to land use and the environment, and beneficial to farmers.<\/p> <p>I hate the term win-win, but if I was ever to use it, that is the context in which I would use it.  We see it in the opportunities around cleaning and greening our energy base.  I take the point Senator Mullen made, but if we get strung up in that area we will never get to the solution.  We must look at the potential opportunities along the western seaboard to serve rural communities.  I accept that we need to move away from harvesting peat the way we did in the midlands, but there are massive opportunities from Donegal to Kerry in capturing offshore wind.  The only point I would make to the Minister of State is that this Government and the previous one have somehow lacked ambition in terms of moving to floating offshore wind.  While I accept there are projects on the east coast, the real opportunity is floating offshore wind.  Other countries have started.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If we can, we have an opportunity to be net exporters not just of energy but of the technologies associated with the floating pontoons.  This would create jobs in places such as Kilrush, Kilkee and Miltown Malbay and help to address the urban-rural divide to give people an opportunity to have gainful employment back in their communities.  That is a win.  Is it protecting the environment?  Absolutely.  Is it having a pop at geopolitics?  Yes, because never again will we need to be dependent on a dictator like Vladimir Putin or the issues in the Middle East or the Gulf or wherever.<\/p><p>Let us become energy independent and become energy exporters.  Let us not say it will take another ten years because we must wait for technologies.  Let us embrace it as a small country.  We did it before in many other fields.   We did it when we set a trend under Se&aacute;n Lemass to develop an industrial zone around a small airport some suggested would not survive at Shannon Airport.  There are 10,000 people working there today because of the vision of somebody like Se&aacute;n Lemass, who said to hell with the official reports - this is a good idea that can happen and is sustainable, which it is.  That area went from light engineering to the most sophisticated technologies now on the face of the earth.  We have companies like Intel and Jaguar Land Rover developing the next wave of technologies around autonomous vehicles.  They are way out there in terms of what they can do.   If we sow the seed, it can grow and it will deliver.<\/p><p>I am really hopeful that this Government, for the length of time it has left, sows that seed for offshore wind capture.  It benefits so much more domestically and locally in a region in terms of job creation and gives families an opportunity to stay and come back.  It changes and removes Europe&rsquo;s dependence on people like Putin and others, who have shown that once they weave their way into our economies, they exercise control in the most heinous way.  What Putin - not the Russian people - is doing in Ukraine is absolutely abominable.  We have seen the destruction of people's homes, migration, the undermining of human dignity and rape and plunder.  To think that is happening in Europe in this day and age is an abhorrence and we have all played into it because we have used the cheap oil.  We have kept it going and now he has us by the neck.  Sadly, this is not being addressed on a worldwide basis by the Chinese, for example, and I am really disappointed with the way the Indians have provided an outlet for Russian oil.  That is obviously their decision but it is wrong.  While the price of oil has spiralled out of control, there has been no reduction in the output of oil between now and 12 months ago.  The same volume of oil is being used and the same volume is being pumped.  The fear around the war of aggression by Russia has spooked the markets, however, and we are paying twice what we should be paying for it.  We cannot let that happen again.  Here is one of the positives from our approach to climate change.  Let us capture our own wind and let us do so in stable democracies.  However one might view the Government from time to time, we have a stable democracy.  We can export that into the European market and we will all benefit.<\/p><p>I supported the carbon tax when it was not popular.  I supported it from an Opposition perspective.  I managed to get the Fianna F&aacute;il team on board at the time as we ran into the local elections.  Notwithstanding what Senator Mullen said, and there is absolute truth in what he said, that does provide a pool of money.  The deal about carbon tax at the time was that it was to be sequestered.  It was not to go into the black hole of the Departments of Finance or Public Expenditure and Reform.  It was money that would be allocated to climate action measures.  The &euro;1.5 billion the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is investing is going back into the greening of the agricultural sector.  It will go into the retrofitting of homes where people have very low incomes and are dependent on social welfare.  That to me is a justification, notwithstanding the pushback from certain sections of the community.  It is a benefit to the least well-off and I hope we can continue to maintain support for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#MM00200","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in to speak with us today on the 2020 Annual Transition Statement.How our society is going to have to adapt to change behaviours in respect of climate is crucial.  We know every person in this country will have to change how they live, work, travel and run his or her home.  I very much appreciate the very detailed update the Minister of State gave us.  I will go through a couple of the points he mentioned in his opening statement.<\/p><p>My concern lies with the most vulnerable and always has.  The support for the measures that will have to be delivered will need to ensure that those who are most vulnerable can be covered and supported as well.  We live in an equal society and &quot;equal society&quot; does not mean that some people who are perhaps in more secure employment, with better access to public transport, are somehow immune to a certain extent to the challenges that are faced by people who live in rural areas.  This is a real concern.<\/p><p>On agriculture, our colleague, Senator Reilly, spoke about famines in the world and what will potentially happen in a number of months.  This comes down to food security and how important it is that agriculture in many ways provides food security.  That has been acknowledged.  I went on a Teagasc walk in Ballydangan outside where I live in Ballinasloe where it was showing farmers about how the planting of red clover will put nitrogen back into the soil.  It is looking at ways to do this and farmers are taking the lead here.<\/p><p>The key message is that farmers are seeking to change practices that will bring a benefit to them and benefits in the quality of beef and the way they are able to sell their beef into new markets, which is crucial.  We must understand that Ireland is a world-class producer of food.  One would be hard put to find another country that would compete with Ireland in terms of the level of dedication, commitment and young people who are involved.  It is a family-run business in many cases but it is also generational.  I do not know how to put it but coming from a farming background, it is a vocation to the land.  This is unique.  What Ireland can achieve in food security and supporting countries needs to be recognised as well.  The challenge we have are the supports we need to put in place now for farmers with higher costs, particularly under the fodder scheme.  The new agri-climate rural environmental scheme, ACRES, was also mentioned.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned innovations with<b><\/b>research and development and the disruptive technologies innovation fund, DTIF, of course, while strategies introduced through Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc will be crucial.  It is not only low-emission slurry spreading and the different types of equipment that farmers can use but that the costs of equipment will be brought down.  How are we looking at reducing the costs of equipment, particularly for newer and young farmers, to put these measures in place?<\/p><p>My second point is the Minister of State mentioned that the rise in emissions is residential.  He said emissions went up by 6% and that was residential.  Yes, of course; I am sure people working from home over the past two years had a major impact but again, I mention the just transition.  The Minister of State will, of course, be very aware of the area I come from in Ballinasloe, east Galway, near Roscommon.  The SEAI comes under the Minister of State's Department.  Its officials appeared before a committee recently where they stated that the authority's budget allocation is now more than &euro;440 million and of that, &euro;267 million is allocated specifically to energy retrofits in homes and communities.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to comment on why the response time is still 24 months for people who apply under the warmer homes scheme.  People in the scheme are getting the fuel allowance.  We have already seen how the Government has supported people by giving additional fuel allowance payments and supports to families and households.  When is this response time going to reduce?  When can we give a better timeline to families who are really struggling?  Can the Minister of State also comment on the contracts or providers for the one-stop shop through the SEAI?  What is the timeline for people who are looking to avail of the one-stop shop?  Are they going to be different from those on the warmer homes scheme?  If that is the case, then we have a serious issue here.<\/p><p>A small pool of people are able to provide the retrofits.  I know the Minister of State is fully aware of this; we all are.  I am on the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and, obviously, we are fighting to increase the number of apprenticeships.  We have four retrofitting centres of excellence across the country.  We are ramping up very fast.  I know this has been in the past year or two but we must be able to have targets in place to say that 24-month response time is coming down.  In no shape or form are we going to be able to challenge those homes and those people in particular if we cannot deliver for those warmer homes.  I do not have the exact numbers but I believe 60,000 people might be on the fuel allowance.<\/p><p>I do not know the precise figures but the majority of buildings being retrofitted are residential.  We also have tens of thousands of public buildings, however.  What is being done in that regard?  Are they being retrofitted?  Will they be brought up to spec prior to us then going out and saying look at what is going to happen on the residential side as well?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are supporting the one-stop shop across many of our areas.  We are having many public information meetings in rural areas to promote the scheme.  This is very important.  However, I would like a comment on how we are managing with our public buildings.<\/p><p>To me, coming from a rural area, transport is another issue.  We attended the West on Track meeting this morning and it was wonderful to see how we could potentially get rail in the west and north west, but the real challenge for me concerns how we will get buses to bring people to hospital and back again when a significant percentage of people do not have access to cars.  There is no form of transport other than the car in many rural areas.  There is no train station or stop in small areas.  In my constituency, the towns have between 6,000 and 7,500 inhabitants.  Most of the people live in very rural areas and need taxis.  They pay extra money for a taxi to get them from A to B because there is no public transport.  The Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan was announced and mentioned here by the Minister of State.  When will it be phased in?  What is the position on the new routes we have spoken about, considering that Bus &Eacute;ireann reduced the number of routes during the Covid pandemic?  For example, the X20 service from Galway to Roscommon was taken away because of what Bus &Eacute;ireann said was competition from private bus services.  That is grand &mdash; there you go &mdash; but where are the other new services that are supposed to be available?  There was to be one from Castlerea to Ballinasloe via Mountbellew and Caltra that would have brought people to Portiuncula hospital, never mind students travelling to T&uacute;s in Athlone or those going to town to shop.  That is what we want to see.  We want to see our smaller towns and villages being vital.  Will the Minister of State comment on the phase-in of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan?<\/p><p>The last point I wanted to mention has gone straight out of my head.  I will probably remember it but the Chair will not let me make it later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#NN00200","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The Senator should not feel bad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#OO00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#OO00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Senator Buttimer might give the Senator some of his time if she remembers her point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#OO00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#OO00500","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Teamwork makes the dream work.<\/p><p>The Minister is very welcome.  Before I get into the content of the annual transition statement, I would like the record to reflect why we are here in 2022 discussing the statement from 2020.  There are legal obligations upon the Minister compelling him to be here under the Climate and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. <b><\/b>According to section 14(1), an annual transition statement shall be presented to each House of the Oireachtas not later than each anniversary of the passing of the Act.  That Act was passed on 10 December 2015.  In a very orderly and lawful manner, an annual transition statement was laid before the Houses every December between 2016 and 2019, but in 2020 the deadline came and went without the annual transition statement. <\/p><p>Despite the legal obligations on the Minister, it was reported in the <i>Irish<\/i><i>Independent<\/i>that the Minister did not propose to prepare an annual transition statement for 2020.  In effect, the Minister was simply choosing what parts of the law he would like to follow.  Such a brazen disregard for climate obligations was quite stunning and a worrying precedent to set for subsequent Ministers responsible for climate action.<\/p><p>It simply would not do for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to shirk his responsibility.  After significant political pressure, he outlined in response to a parliamentary question, which was requested by my colleague Senator Boylan, that he intended to publish the statement by the end of 2021.  Even though he was setting a deadline 12 months after the statutory deadline, this was a welcome U-turn.  Unfortunately, that deadline was also missed, and the Climate Change Advisory Council rightfully reprimanded the Government in its annual review of the Government's climate efforts at the end of 2021.  Then, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Climate Action in January 2022, a Department official told Senator Boylan it would be published by the end of March.  Finally, on 10 June, we saw the annual transition statement, 547 days after the due date.  It is a worrying precedent.  We know that climate commitments are not worth the paper they are written on unless they are adhered to.  If the Minister is casual about his obligations, how seriously can he expect other Ministers to take their legal commitments?<\/p><p>Now I would like to turn to the content of the annual transition statement.  In the past, such statements have been criticised by the Climate Change Advisory Council for failing &quot;to provide a balanced and coherent overview of the progress of the sectors, tending to highlight the positives, and under-emphasise measures where there are data gaps or challenges.&quot; Unfortunately, this year is no different.<\/p><p>One of the most glaring inconsistencies in climate policy is the drive for more and more data centres, yet data centres are mentioned only once in the statement.  Data centres place a massive burden on our energy system through their insatiable demand for more and more generation capacity.  The previous Fine Gael Government rolled out the red carpet for data centres.  It sought to make Ireland, especially Dublin, the data centre capital of the world, with very little thought given to the impact this would have on our electricity supply or carbon emissions.  Despite our more ambitious climate targets and the increased threat of electricity blackouts, the current Government has not changed its approach sufficiently.  Data centres now use as much electricity as all the homes in rural Ireland combined.  Their consumption is set to at least double by 2030.  As a result of a failure to get a handle on supply and demand for electricity, including from data centres, the State is set to spend &euro;350 million on new gas-powered generators.  That is policy incoherence plain and simple, but it barely even gets a mention in the statement.<\/p><p>Reports from the Environmental Protection Agency tell us what we know already.  The gap between stated ambition and actual emissions reductions continues to widen.  Total greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have increased by 6% in 2021 rather than to have decreased by the required 4.8%, as per the Climate Change Advisory Council's carbon budgets.  The years 2019 and 2020 were supposed to be points of inflection, where we finally started getting a handle on the problem.  However, we are still very far from that point.  Earlier this year, the head of the EPA said emissions are again unlikely to fall in 2022.  We are a good part of the way through the first carbon budget period and we are still pressing full steam ahead.  I do not say all this to score political points, because it is in everyone's interest to meet the climate targets so we will have a liveable climate; rather, I say it in the political sense because each missed target only makes the path the next Government has to climb that bit steeper.<\/p><p>Our energy sector has huge potential to deliver significant carbon savings.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for an acceleration in the delivery of renewables, especially offshore wind and green hydrogen, and for the removal of barriers to solar, such as the prohibition on direct lines crossing roads and red tape preventing schools from installing solar.  We need to speed up the process for wind generation.  The Government can fully resource the agencies involved, such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.<\/p><p>At the same time, we need adequate resourcing for our marine planning departments, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and environmental NGOs so biodiversity is not unduly damaged in the race for offshore wind turbines.  We are in a twin crisis of climate and biodiversity.  We need to deliver on carbon budgets and protect our biodiversity, getting the balance right such that biodiversity will not be the sacrificial lamb of climate action.<\/p><p>There are many opportunities in this transition to make our society better.  We need to bring people along with us, and that is why Sinn F&eacute;in believes the just transition is not just a bonus add-on to climate action but that it must be front and centre.  We need to protect workers whose livelihoods will be affected by the transition and build a new sustainable economy around principles of community wealth building rather than just extraction.  There will be no transition if it is not just.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#OO00600","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending and outlining the position on the annual emissions statement.  It is worth pointing out that we are doing so at a stage when, as reported last week, one third of the population is in energy poverty.  It is unfortunate that we are dealing with the figures from 2019 and not the present-day ones because it is difficult to have a look at an honest, realistic benchmark.  I say that because the Government came into power in 2020.  It has made significant progress from a green perspective in putting climate change on the agenda and trying to mainstream it across all Departments.  From that perspective, the Minister of State and his party should be complimented.<\/p><p>It is quite ironic that we see today in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that some of the Minister of State's partners in government, including the T&aacute;naiste and Chief Whip, have forwarded emails they received from drivers about the Phoenix Park, which is one of the great green spaces in our city.  The drivers said their cars were cutting out because they could not possibly drive at 30 km\/h.  I believe this is absolutely ridiculous.  Sometimes I find that while some of the Green Party members of the Government have the best of ideas and intentions, they can be undermined by their Government partners, having regard to the ridiculous notions I have mentioned.<\/p><p>I want to focus on energy poverty and who is in energy poverty.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While the Government has done a lot to make grants available for people to retrofit their homes, there needs to be a focus on those who are at the lower end of the income scale and who are mainly living in rental accommodation through the HAP system or in social housing or AHB-supported housing.  There needs to be a renewed focus put on that.  I have concerns around retrofitting and I am concerned that some landlords will use Government grants to retrofit their homes, then claim substantial renovations have been made and make a move to either raise the rent or evict people from their rental accommodation.  I would like to see a situation where Government explicitly outlaws anybody who has used Government-funded grants to upgrade their homes for energy reasons from raising the rent or evicting vulnerable tenants.  We are seeing a greater number of people enter homelessness from the private rental sector, which is a concern of mine.<\/p><p>Another thing I want to focus on in the area of housing is the reuse of building material.  The Minister of State was here last week when we discussed the circular economy and Senator Boylan and I both focused on the embodied carbon that is already in existing buildings.  We see planning applications come up and come through and an awful lot of the time they are for the knocking or destruction of buildings that have embodied carbon already.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, was here to discuss the Planning and Development (Built Heritage Protection) Bill 2022.  We see situations where developers or owners will sometimes allow buildings of significant heritage value to fall into disrepair so they can get the excuse to be able to knock them.  That has heritage and housing implications but it also has significant climate implications because the emissions figures from the construction industry from building new housing are significant.  We need to get used to reusing and reimagining buildings and to reimagining purpose within our cities with what already exists there to try to lessen the climate and emissions target from providing housing for our population.<\/p><p>I also want to echo some of the comments others have made on wind energy.  We have not fully exploited the potential Ireland has.  A lot of it is focused on the eastern seaboard because the technology has not developed to fully exploit the potential of the Atlantic for wind energy but we can also look at countries similar to ourselves, such as Scotland, which has done much better in meeting its energy needs from wind energy and in exporting it.  With that in mind, I am glad to see energy and EirGrid connections to France coming, for example, so that we can potentially export the energy we have.  We have a long way to go but it is one of the focuses we have to have in Ireland's potentially leading role in making Europe energy secure.  The southern side of Europe can become energy secure with solar energy and the northern side of Europe can become energy secure with wind energy.<\/p><p>I notice that the statements are heavy on emissions from transport.  The Minister of State knows that the cost of transport congestion is not just emissions but that it is also things like congestion.  Sometimes people think that converting to 1 million electric cars is somehow a panacea and that they are single-handedly saving the environment by themselves because they drive a big and expensive electric car that probably took more carbon to produce and that uses more public space than otherwise.  I know that the Minister for Transport has been working on improving our cycle infrastructure within our towns and cities and I would also like us to work on that in our rural areas.  I would like us to have protected cycle infrastructure and we simply do not have that in Dublin.  I cycle most days and it is extremely dangerous.  What I have noticed in recent years is that the cars that are driving alongside me might be electric but they are silent, much bigger, take up more road space and think they are entitled to do so.  We have to have a look at the size of cars.  Even if we have to focus on what carbon they take to make in terms of charging them for congestion, that is another area we should look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#OO00700","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I have to join with the points made by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile about regretting that we have not been having these transition statements in the way we should have done over the last few years.  I was in the last Oireachtas and we had them at that point.  There are two aspects of regret.  It has been an opportunity missed by the Government in forwarding the climate debate to have these transition statements every year.  I would also note the powers that were there under the 2015 Act for the relevant Minister to request other Ministers to come and present to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the years when these transition statements were most effective and meaningful, Ministers from multiple different Departments were coming in to talk about what they were doing on climate change, which meant there was a more detailed discussion.  With respect to the Minister of State and his comprehensive statement that tried to cover every single area and Department, the fact is it should be the case that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is having an annual debate in each House where he talks about what he is doing on climate action.  It should be the case that the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are in and that each of them are answering questions on transition.  I know they will have sectoral targets and the Minister of State might indicate in his response if it is intended that the statements will be dealt with in this way each year because he has said this will be the last year of this format.  Will we be having those annual reports?  There was capacity under the 2015 Act for the Minister with responsibility for the environment to request that other Ministers would present to the Houses.  That would have been good and helpful with the challenge of making every Department take on this issue with the same level of vigour.  Each Department could have been subject to the kind of detailed scrutiny on the kind of detailed decisions that we are facing into.<\/p><p>I also want to refer back to the other Senator who suggested that maybe we should just focus on adaptation or who seemed to prioritise adaptation because it would be too difficult.  Adapting to 1.5&deg;C, 2&deg;C or 2.5&deg;C of temperature increase are different and that is why mitigation and everything we can possibly do to reduce the impact and increase in carbon emissions to mitigate the devastating impacts, as well as adapt to them, is crucial.  When I hear people saying the ship has sailed and let us adapt, it brings to mind one of the most chilling moments I have seen, which was at the climate talks in Madrid, when I accidentally wandered into the room where insurance companies were pitching to different cities.  As different countries failed to set ambitious enough targets for their emission reductions the mayors of various cities were hearing from insurance companies about the moneys they could pay to try to deal with the impacts of climate change.  The presenters were talking about how it would depend on whether one had 100,000 or 200,000 deductibles.  This meant how many people in one's city would have to die before the insurance company might pay out for impacts from climate change.<\/p><p>When I hear people saying it is too difficult to do this and that we should focus on adaptation, what I hear is that we want a little survival ship for the wealthiest and that we are happy to let millions of people die.  That is what the choice is.  There is no <i>status quo<\/i>but if we have business as usual it is a small pool who will be able to maintain that because the impact on the global economy of a 2&deg;C temperature change will be devastating, not simply for a few, the most marginal or those in coastal areas, but for the majority of the world.  In that context, the top 1% of wealthy people have emissions that are equivalent to the bottom 50% of the world's population.  Therefore, I am not happy enough that the bottom 50% of the world's population should take the hit for the top 1% of people to stay wealthy or even to get wealthier.<\/p><p>In that context I will join with the points that were well made by Senator Pauline O'Reilly on international justice because that is the crucial priority.  I have opinions on all of the Departments but this is crucial.  Ireland's fair share of the &euro;100 billion that we have promised under the sustainable development goals is not &euro;85 million or &euro;95 million where we are now.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is also not the &euro;275 million we say we are moving to.  It is &euro;475 million.  That is what would constitute a fair share of the &euro;100 billion, which is, in itself, inadequate.  I am concerned that we are not delivering what we need to.  It is crucial that we do not muddy the line between overseas development aid, which will still be desperately needed, and climate funding and financing.  Why is spending on the UN climate fund still such a small proportion of the moneys we intend to spend, at &euro;4 million?  We saw the EU seeking to block proper debate of the issues of loss and damage at the climate talks in Bonn and at the Conference of the Parties, COP.  What will Ireland be doing to ensure that there is not only financing, but acknowledgement of loss and damage and payment for the very real and devastating damage that has been done to developing countries?  I am not talking about adaptation funding, a few dollars to help countries adapt to the things we will continue doing, but about actual compensation for the damage being done.<\/p><p>I have a lot of opinions about the area of transport, although many of my points have already been well made.  The ideas are there, as are the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  There are two areas in which we need to scale up.  One is the area of retrofitting.  I am not just talking about the warmer homes scheme, but about local authority schemes.  The figure of &euro;85 million is not enough.  We know that we can do more on that.  That needs to be front-loaded.  I would love to see a trebling of what we are doing with local authorities with regard to retrofitting given the energy crisis.  Peatland rehabilitation was mentioned as a project to come out of that climate fund but that is not enough.  While the funding for peatlands is increasing, this is an area where action needs to be front-loaded.  A key principle of the transition is that it must be fast and fair so we must consider what are the early front-loaded actions that can deliver the greatest impact as quickly as possible.  Some of those involve upfront public expenditure rather than a shift towards a new market model.  That is something to be looked at with regard to retrofitting.<\/p><p>I regret that we have sought another derogation from the nitrates directive.  We are again pushing out action on this issue.  We need to be honest with regard to fodder and food security.  We talk about feeding the world and, while our beef and dairy have a role in that regard, they are not the main mechanism in feeding the world and we need to be very honest about that.  The current model does not work for 60% of farmers.  It is about inventing new ways of rewarding and paying farmers to do something very different rather than propping up a model that does not work for the majority.<\/p><p>With regard to energy, we hear about a plan to begin to stop the development of data centres but we also see the energy they are consuming.  Moving away from Russian fuel was also mentioned.  I have to flag two important issues.  If we are making that shift and getting rid of oil and gas from Russia, we need to ensure that we are not continuing to make ethical mistakes in other areas.  I was extremely disappointed to hear this week that the EU has signed a deal for the importation of natural gas from Israel without including the language used in every previous trade agreement between the EU and Israel which specifically says that products shall not come from occupied territories.  This is crucial given the massive natural gas reserves in the Levant basin which the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD, highlighted in the last year as a new discovery estimated to be worth &euro;524 billion and holding the equivalent of 1.7 billion barrels.  If we are contributing to an occupying country trading in or exploiting gas and fossil fuel reserves in an occupied territory, we are contributing to the exact same problem we say we want to challenge with regard to Russia and Ukraine.  We must be morally consistent on that.  It is a priority.  Will the Minister of State tell us what position Ireland will take in challenging that decision of the EU?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#PP00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this very important topic.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I know he is very much <i>au fait <\/i>with this topic.  It is sometimes hard to understand what is happening.  We were importing peat while at the same time producing peat for export, although that was shut down and we are now just importing peat.  On the other hand, we were paying very significant fines to Europe in respect of a wind farm at Derrybrien in Galway.  We are now taking down the wind turbines on that site.  That should be looked at.  The turbines are already there and the damage that was done will not be rectified.  The facility should be handed over to the State.  Perhaps the energy produced by this wind farm could be used to offset poverty in our country.<\/p><p>It is important to look at the way various Departments have acted over recent years and at how slowly the wheels turn within them.  They can put great pressure on various business sectors and on the farming sector to make very significant changes while not acting as quickly themselves.  We can see how slowly the wheels are turning in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with regard to foreshore licensing for offshore wind farms.  There is only one offshore wind farm in the country and it is on the east coast while we are told the best wind speeds in Europe are those off the west coast.  We have been hearing about this for the last ten or 11 years.  We have been coming in here for transition statements and so forth year after year but, at the same time, there does not seem to be any great urgency with regard to this matter.  <\/p><p>There are various other opportunities Departments, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the local authorities could avail of.  There is any number of lakes in this country where hydroelectric power could be generated.  This could power public lighting for local authorities.  In my own town of Castlebar, there are three connected lakes that come right into the town.  We could put in a weir to produce that type of energy if the OPW and the local authority were to come together.  It could be done as a pilot project.  There are many such opportunities throughout the length and breadth of the country that could be looked at but the Departments, the local authority and the OPW all act too slowly.  It has been a long time since Pat Rabbitte was the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  He was in the same Department as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, whom I welcome to the House, is in now.  He talked about many of those issues.  In many cases, there has been no movement on them.  I must acknowledge the great strides the Minister is making.  <\/p><p>We had a meeting with West on Track on its proposal to extend the line from Athenry to Claremorris, which would cost a minimal amount of money, &euro;158 million.  I have noticed a great increase in rail traffic over the last two or three years but the services must be in place before people will use them.  A certain frequency of service is also required.  There is not enough frequency on the lines from Westport and Ballina to Dublin to get to the required levels of participation, even though the capacity and usage of those lines has increased over the last two years in particular.<\/p><p>I will touch on the issue of domestic solar generation.  I know the Minister is very <i>au fait<\/i>with this.  There is an enormous difference between a good sunny day and a cloudy day with regard to producing energy.  There is also a big difference in the amount of energy the same type of solar panel can produce in the north of the country and in the sunny south east.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At this stage, we should consider manufacturing small 2 kW and 3 kW wind turbines to complement house solar panels so people can become self-sufficient.  Quite a number of houses, maybe up to 1 million throughout the country, could avail of small wind turbines, which would be very efficient.  This country could manufacture them because we are world-class leaders in the production of some farm machinery.  I have no doubt we could be world-class leaders in the production of those type of small wind turbines as well, if we only got our act together to produce them.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment could play a major role in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#QQ00200","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I listened to the contribution made by Senator Mullen and I saw a lot of common sense in what he said.  I do not think he wanted to be pessimistic but realistic about where we are.  It is becoming clear we will struggle significantly to comply with the 2030 carbon reduction targets.  That is not a happy situation because once a public perception develops that the targets are not achievable, we are into a very fluid situation where people will ask why they should bother, if the ultimate target to be achieved by the whole community is unlikely to be achieved.<\/p> <p>I will say a couple of things about our general resources.  Quite clearly, the Minister will be aware that we now need a very significant investment in the State's electricity transmission system, especially if the plan is to electrify transport on an increasing basis in the future.  If we are to reconcile data centres with our reduction on electricity dependence and, at the same time, transfer carbon-based transport to electric-powered transport, a number of things will have to be balanced.  At this stage, I am not sure that I see a coherent plan for all of this.  The Minister is committed to producing a plan later in the year on many of these matters.  I would like to see how it all adds up.<\/p> <p>The best part of five years ago, I remember querying how we could reconcile - the Minister and I were sitting at a committee - what the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland was telling us about electricity demand and supply with the programme for building data centres.  At the time, I got the flannel treatment of vague nonsense of a reassuring kind from the Department and the SEAI.  It was clear to me then that there were two irreconcilable vectors at the centre of public policy.  One Department was promoting data centres while another State body that had responsibility for reconciling our climate change targets with what was happening on the ground was apparently staying schtum on that issue.<\/p> <p>I have a funny feeling that many different factors are now at work, which are again irreconcilable, for instance, in respect of the building industry at present.  Anybody who talks to a builder will say he or she cannot even enter into a contract at present because fixed-price contracts mean nothing any more.  I talked to a small builder in the west recently who said he just cannot quote for projects any more.  That is one issue.  There are real problems with inputs into building homes.  There are then ambitious targets to retrofit homes and for some forms of infrastructure.  Is the construction industry capable of delivering all these targets?<\/p> <p>We talk about climate budgets but is there a great master plan?  Is there in fact a spreadsheet at the heart of Government where all the conflicting demands, such as taxation and the end of hydrocarbon taxation and all the rest of it, are being worked out?  Is somebody saying this is the plan, it all works out, it will all happen, we will have the alternative energy supplies and building of homes to deal with the housing crisis and, at the same time, we will build infrastructure, retrofit houses and the building and construction industry will be able to do all these things?  Is it all thought through?  The Minister can see and articulate some of the problems but is the whole of government actually being realistic with itself?  Are we just hoping we will be able to achieve targets and deal with things such as the homelessness crisis, or are we actually planning to do so at an all-of-government level?  I very much doubt it.  I feel apprehensive that there is a gap between aspiration and achievement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#RR00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Senator McDowell's reference to aspiration versus ambition, plan, succession and implementation is a very apt place to begin.  This is a very important debate but it is not just a debate.  It is about changing how we do business and changing our lifestyles.  That is why it is important this debate is healthy.  As Senators Mullen and McDowell said, it is also about challenging whether we are right as a Government in how we are doing this and how we can achieve the climate action plan figures, which we have to do and which have to be attainable.  If we look at the EPA report indicating that our emissions have increased by 6% in 2021 following the hiatus in 2020, it shows we have a job of work to do.<\/p> <p>I compliment the Minister, his Department and the National Transport Authority on their very positive and ambitious plans - they are not just plans but are becoming realities - for the overhaul of the public transport network in Cork and the commitment of the Minister, on behalf of the Government, to those plans.  In the context of Senator McDowell's remarks, that is an example of a Minister in a Government who is driving, with the local authority and key stakeholders in the region, the ambition to increase public transport use.  I am genuinely upbeat about the BusConnects programme for Cork.  We thought it was brilliant to have one 24-hour bus service.  I have used it, both coming and going, at all hours of the day and night.  To now have a second one, going from Carrigaline to Hollyhill, is welcome.  What is even more important about the Cork routes is we now have routes that were never serviced before being included, which gives the option to make that modal shift from the car to the bus.  It is to be hoped that in time, with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, we will see the transformation of light rail from Mallow to Cork and from Cork to Youghal, although that might be too ambitious.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What a pity we got rid of the west Cork railway.  What short-sightedness.  It would be a treasure to have now.<\/p><p>Under Ireland 2040, Cork is a growth area, as we know.  It is the counterfoil to Dublin.  Demand is growing and expectation is high.  That is why the 24-hour bus service is important.  It is more important to have high-frequency services.  People will switch to buses because of their frequency.  I live in an area with a good, frequent, reliable and on-time service.  I thank Bus &Eacute;ireann in Cork for that.<\/p><p>I know the Minister is committed to this.  I hope he can persuade his Government colleagues during budget negotiations, if not before, that public transport fares should be further reduced and that the reduced fares should be retained beyond 2023, which I believe is the current plan.  It is important that the 20% fare reduction we have introduced continues.  There is a debate about whether public transport should be free and I know some people are very strong proponents of that proposal.  I would be open to that but I acknowledge the Government must create revenue to pay for investment.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell in his contribution spoke about our targets for 2030.  I have attended a number of events organised by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and the car industry in Cork and Dublin.  There are concerns that we will not meet our target for electric cars by 2030 or the targets outlined in the climate action plan.  Some 774 battery-only electric vehicles were registered in May 2022.  I know that 43.14% of the fleet is now electric, plug-in hybrid or hybrid.  I wonder will we achieve the targets in the climate action plan.<\/p><p>I hope that as part of the budget we will continue to incentivise retrofitting.  There are issues around retrofitting at the moment because of the lack of availability of work crews.  There are also issues around gaining access to information.  Cars are also an issue.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on the work he is doing.  I commend the whole-of-government approach that is being taken.  To his credit, the T&aacute;naiste, before he became a part of this three-party Government, was one of the first party leaders, other than the Minister to speak about the importance of climate action and climate change.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, said that the challenges we face are stark.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help the next generation.  That is our challenge.  I am firmly convinced that we will do that, under the direction of the Minister.  I thank him for being here and commend the statements to the House.

I will look back at the record to read the earlier contributions.<\/p> <p>To respond to Senator McDowell, we could easily lapse into despondency and ask why should we do anything because it is too late to address climate change.  There is no doubt but that it will be a challenge beyond compare.  What we need to do will require incredible change.  We need to halve our emissions this decade and achieve net-zero in three decades.  It is no small change.  It will require considerable effort but various things make me confident that we can and will do it.<\/p> <p>Our targets do not only exist because of commitments in the programme for Government.  Those commitments were the right ones to make.  They take a science-based approach to the Paris climate agreement we signed stating what we need to do to reduce the probability of, if not avoid completely, runaway climate change that would take us past the tipping point.  The reasonable commitment for a developed country like Ireland to make is to halve our emissions in a decade.  We are committed to that through the Paris climate agreement and our programme for Government.  We are also committed to it in the European Union.  Next week, I will attend a European energy Council meeting.  Under the Fit for 55 package, Europe intends to reduce its emissions by 55%.  The major legislative blocks of change coming from Europe is the European strategy.  This is the European economic strategy as well as the climate strategy.  It represents the entire effort.  It is backed up by what is happening with the war in Ukraine.  Our alternative is to remain reliant on imported fossil fuels, for which we do not set the price, for which we lose the balance of payments and for which we do not get the jobs.  That would leave us exposed and is not a tenable approach to take.  Even if these targets were not among our programme for Government commitments, we would be compelled towards them.<\/p> <p>We are not in a good place because we had a lost decade from 2011 onwards.  We did not manage the emission reductions that were achieved in other countries.  That means what we have to do is more challenging than what is faced by some of our neighbouring countries, which have taken actions over the past decade.  None of the actions of those countries have been perfect.  In fact, none have been very good.  If one looks under the hood of the changes that have been made, we are not too far behind.  However, we are behind and need to catch up and overtake.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell asked whether there is a plan, and there is.  The climate action plan is the plan.  I believe it is a good structure and it is backed up by the climate law we passed last year.  One of the most compelling reasons it is the right structure is that it came out of political consensus.  It was not the strategy of this Government alone.  It was built on the work done by the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, in setting up such a structure and a planned approach.  The approach includes hundreds of actions that test to see are we on track to meet our commitments.  It is based on consensus more than any other public policy.  We have climate law, the Climate Change Advisory Council, the carbon budgets we have set up and the action plan, which is designed to be revised every year, plus the sectoral targets that mean each Minister in every area knows what he or she must meet.  The climate action plan, initiated last November, will be revised in the coming November.  It is designed to be an iterative plan so we will know if we are falling behind in a particular area, which is a possibility to which the Senator drew attention.  It is not the case that we will suddenly arrive in 2030 and be left in the position of saying things did not happen in the way we thought they would.  If we are falling behind in a particular area, the plan requires Ministers to adjust and to change policies to achieve our targets.  That is a real challenge but it is also an opportunity.  The reason I believe we will meet the challenge is it will only work if we are moving towards a better system.<\/p> <p>We need to change in a variety of key areas.  Energy is probably the biggest such area.  We must change from being a country that is among the most reliant on imported fossil fuels and with a high dependency on gas for our power generation.  We have a record of massive increasing demand for oil in our transport sector over the past 20 or 30 years.  We must switch to our own energy and fuel, which we have securely available.  In fact, we have a comparative competitive advantage.  We live in a very windy country.  This is where all the investment, technological innovation and development is taking place.  Why would we not want to tap into that comparative competitive advantage and switch from burning imported fuels brought from far away at enormous cost towards an alternative over which we have control?  We are good at balancing variable supply.  My father used to say that if you get a reputation as an early riser, you can lie in for the rest of your days.  The Danes are very good at integrating renewables but I think we are better.  We run our integrated renewables on an isolated synchronised system where we are good at managing variable supply and demand.  We should build on what we are good at.<\/p> <p>I heard Senator Buttimer's contribution and he is right that we are going to transform Cork for the better.  Like many other Irish cities, Cork followed a sprawling model.  There is nothing wrong with Ballincollig, Carrigaline, Midleton or any of the other towns that prospered as Cork hollowed out but now is the time to bring life back into the centre.  We are building the metropolitan rail system for Cork.  It is real and it is happening.  There will be a new station in Tivoli.  I met Land Development Agency officials the other day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eamon Ryan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We could house 11,000 people in Tivoli, a stunning location right on the river, close to the train station with trains at ten- or 15-minute intervals, better than the DART service.  What is not to like about that as a way of switching?  The benefit of that is the emissions reduction is not just in the mode of transport but actually in a reduction of the volume of transport because people are living closer to the centre - the 15-minute city concept.  I could go right across this country to cities, towns and villages where that transformation can, should and will apply, using our own power supply, using electricity rather than oil.  Next week the European Council will agree the end of the internal combustion engine by 2035.  I do not envisage anyone rejecting it.  The European Parliament will approve it.  This is coming and this is the better economy.  This is something we can be good at.<\/p><p>The same applies with farming.

It is a real challenge.<\/p> <p>I accept there was a contradiction in our policy on data centres.  We kept the door too wide open for too long.

I will tell the Senator the reason.  It goes back to efficiency.  We will get the workforce because the system before this was always stop-start, with building contractors working for six months and then stopped for six months, having to wait to find out whether there was more money.  It is no wonder the industry did not scale up.  Now that they know that they have &euro;9 billion in funding guaranteed for the next ten years, they will scale up.  For young people coming out of college or school this summer or doing their leaving certificate who want a career for 30 years, one that is helping to solve the key problems of our society and is deeply rewarding and fulfilling because it will improve the health of their homes, there will be nothing better.  Those numbers will rise as well as being able to provide homes.<\/p> <p>I will finish on the point of efficiency in everything.  The switch to an electrified system backed up by hydrogen, to electric vehicles and to really clever use of our land will work and will be delivered because it is actually a better system.  We will not crack the whip and turn people on political righteousness by saying they have done the right thing or wrong thing.  However, the country can and will switch away from a burning system where we burn imported fuels to one where we use our own in very efficient digital systems.  That is the new industrial revolution that is taking place across the world.  We can and will be good at it.  It will take us a while to ramp it up but it is happening.<\/p> <p>The retrofitting is happening.  It has massive applications beyond compare.  People are looking to do it because they realise it actually makes sense.  Just as we switched from open fires to central heating in three decades, we will switch in three decades from burning anything to having really well-insulated electrically powered homes.  It will be the same with cars.  There will not be internal combustion engine vehicles in three decades time because the alternative is better.  It is just more efficient.  That is why I am confident we will make this leap.  It is a leap; it is beyond compare.  The climate action plan sets out how we do it.

We continue to do that today.  Some of the ultra-high interest rates that moneylenders are charging are absolutely unethical and immoral, and permitting them to do so is unethical.  It traps vulnerable borrowers into vicious cycles of debt.  That is scandalous and it can be legislated against, which is why we have put forward this amendment, the only proposed amendment, to the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill.<\/p><p>I invite the Minister of State to give his response before I go any further.

I am aware that his party has a great interest in this legislation and I engaged with Deputy Doherty in the D&aacute;il on the same amendment on all Stages of the Bill in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>Lower interest rates are better for consumers and that is why the key purpose of this legislation is to reduce interest rates.  Members of the Opposition will say that the Government is not being ambitious enough, but we have to strike a balance here to reduce rates without reducing access to credit.<\/p> <p>I will outline what we are proposing for cash loans.  There is currently a concentration of loan offerings at between 1% and 1.2% per week in respect of moneylenders in the market.  An initial interest rate cap of 1% per week will allow all moneylenders operating at the rates above this to revise their business model and reduce their margins to enable them to operate within the new legislative cap.  At present, most moneylenders in the market are above 1% per week and we want to bring them down to 1% per week.  It goes without saying that some of them are at astronomically high rates and some of them charge money for every time they make a house visit to collect money.  That really adds to the cost of the loan for the most vulnerable people.<\/p> <p>Research has shown that the people who are mainly inclined to borrow from such moneylenders tend to be women in their early 30s and up to their 50s with young families who they are rearing alone.  They are the most vulnerable.  They have back to school, birthdays, first communions and Christmas expenses through the year and they get loans and try to roll them forward.  They get a loan from one company on one occasion and another loan from another company at another time.  The essence of this legislation is to ensure that any time an organisation gives a loan in future, it will check what other loans the borrower has.  That has not been happening up to now.  The company will want to make sure that the person can actually afford the loan being taken out.  There is no point in accumulating loans that people will not be able to pay in the long term.<\/p> <p>The 1% is our starting point.  We are saying this is the maximum that can be charged, but it is planned to start with 1%.  Over a period of a couple of years, when the Central Bank reports on how the approximately 30 companies are operating in Ireland, we will be able to assess if the 1% is still valid and whether there might be scope to reduce it as time passes.<\/p> <p>The proposal in the amendment is to set the rate at 0.75% per week rather than 1% per week, with specific timelines to reduce it further.  I propose to introduce the latter rate and to monitor it closely.  We can return to it at a later date when we have evidence and information on how it is operating and whether it is valid to reduce it below 1% and by how much at that stage.  The amendment is predetermining how the legislation will work in practice over the forthcoming period by providing for set times to reduce it, but I believe the most cautious way to do it is by doing what is provided for in the Bill, subject to review.<\/p> <p>The most important point, as I said earlier, is that there is continued access available to these loan facilities.  The biggest provider in the market, both in Ireland and the UK, closed shop in the last couple of years and no longer exists.  The provider felt the market was too difficult.  If we move too strongly, the people who need access to these loans may not have somebody to go to if the providers pull out due to us being too severe too quickly.  We want to keep them in the market because, as everybody knows, if we reduce the number of people who are offering legitimate, regulated loans, we know where people will go.  They will go to loan sharks and it will end up that when the borrower collects child benefit once a month, a guy will be waiting around the corner to collect that money.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We want to avoid that.  We do not want people calling to their houses and intimidating them to repay their loans.  It is important that we keep a level of regulated operators in the field providing loans for a period.  We can see how it works out over that period.<\/p><p>We are starting with the 1% cap, which will be the maximum.  It can be reduced if we get information from the Central Bank's monitoring of the 30 or so companies in the business showing that a reduction is appropriate in due course, but to predetermine that there would be a reduction after a certain time would be premature at this point because we do not have any information on how that would affect the market and, above all, the people who were most vulnerable and needed to have a regulated moneylender.  If we are too quick and some of the moneylenders leave, which the main one has already done, then people will not have access to proper funding and will instead become victims of money sharks, which is what we want to avoid.<\/p><p>We all agree on the need for the legislation, everything behind it, regulating this sector, applying time limits of up to 12 months on loans and having simple interest rates that people can understand.  The only issue between us is the level of that interest.  Otherwise, the Bill is broadly supported.  We should stick with the maximum of 1% and see how it goes.  It can be reduced when the Central Bank reverts with a report on how it is working after a year or two.  This Bill will reduce the rates that people are being charged from day 1 because most lenders of these loans are charging up to 1.2%, but we want to keep them in the market so that people do not go to money sharks.<\/p><p>I hope that the Senator accepts the spirit of our position, notwithstanding the particular point of difference over the fractional interest rate in question.

Wearing my hat as Minister of State with responsibility for credit unions, I would encourage everyone who is seeking a short-term loan for a family event - it is something that people used to do - to join his or her local credit union where possible.  I fear that some of the people in question have exhausted their credit limits with their credit unions, every other institution and their family and friends, and that this is their lender of last resort.  We want to keep the lender of last resort in the field so that that option is available.  If such lenders are gone, we know what will happen to the people who are most vulnerable.  It will not be an interest rate of 1% per week, but 2% or 3%.  A money shark will give them &euro;40 today and they will pay them back &euro;50 on Friday.  I would hate to try to do that annual percentage rate calculation, but it is what happens.  The Senator and I know from dealing with people in vulnerable positions that they will take that loan even though the interest rate could work out being 1,000% if we ran the figures.  We want to avoid that happening.<\/p> <p>Credit cards are running at well over 20% and these loans are dearer than that, but 20% appears to be the minimum interest for a credit card loan to be profitable.  There is probably a higher level of default than there is on traditional credit union or bank loans.  However, I agree with the Senator.  Through the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Department of Social Protection, credit unions offer particular loans.  I would encourage anyone to go to his or her credit union.  Some people believe that credit unions are for their grannies or their parents and do not think they are for them, but they are for everyone.<\/p> <p>I understand the Senator's point, which is to go a little further on day 1 and then make guaranteed reductions at fixed times as we go along.  We are making major progress, though, and the 1% rate will be the maximum.  Depending on the information we get from the Central Bank on how the rate operates, it can be reduced at a later date.  My principal objective is to keep regulated lenders in the market.  We could agree to reduce the rate to 0.5% today, but all of the lenders would disappear because it would not be economical for them to remain in the market.  If that happened, everyone would be worse off.  We believe we have struck a fair balance.

The D&aacute;il passed its motion on this matter yesterday evening.  The political guidelines presented by the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, highlighted the need to prevent and combat violence against women, to protect victims and to punish offenders as a key priority for the Commission.  The European Parliament has also repeatedly called on the Commission to propose legislation on violence against women and domestic violence, and on gender-based cyberviolence.<\/p> <p>Violence against women is gender-based violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately.  It includes all acts of gender-based violence that result in or are likely to result in physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering.  Domestic violence is a form of violence against women as it disproportionately affects women.  It occurs in the family or domestic unit, irrespective of biological or legal family ties, either between intimate partners or between other family members, including between parents and children.  Again, women are disproportionately represented as victims due to the underlying patterns of coercion, power and-or control with such violence being a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women.  It was fitting that this proposal was published on 8 March this year, which was International Women's Day.<\/p> <p>The proposal aims to make the current EU legal instruments relevant to combating violence against women and domestic violence more effective by filling identified gaps in protection, access to justice, and support for victims of these heinous crimes.  It also seeks to align EU law with established international standards - most obviously the Istanbul Convention, which is widely recognised as the most far-reaching legal instrument to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence.  While Ireland ratified the convention in 2019, the current EU proposal aims to ensure the application of minimum standards in all EU member states, including those that have not yet ratified and, unfortunately, those that are considering withdrawing.  Currently, no specific piece of EU legislation comprehensively addresses violence against women and domestic violence.  This directive will be the first act that specifically addresses this type of violence.<\/p> <p>All member states address violence against women and domestic violence in legislation and policies but to different degrees.  Of course the different approaches can create legal uncertainty about rights for such victims across the Union.  While the EU already supports member states in addressing this kind of violence by using funding and policy measures, and relevant horizontal legal instruments, further targeted legislative action at an EU level is necessary to make the existing measures more effective and to further strengthen EU instruments to combat violence against women and domestic violence by laying down minimum rules.  For the member states that are parties to the Istanbul Convention, the EU measures would support the convention's implementation.  The current proposal would enable further co-ordinated measures across the EU and enable EU enforcement.  With the proposal, the Commission aims to strike a balance between ensuring that the obligations it lays down are effective, and leaving flexibility for member states to take into account national specificities and needs when implementing its rules.<\/p> <p>In January, this House debated a motion on violence against women where it was recognised by all Senators that we need to do more.  As shifts in long-held mindsets and changes in behaviours do not occur over weeks or even months, we need to continue to work as hard as possible to see real changes happen.  Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all of its forms is a priority for me and this Government.  It is a personal priority for me.  As all Senators will know, I have worked for the last 18 months on the goals and desired outcomes of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which I will bring to the Government very soon.  I know that this House is as committed as I am to achieving our goal of a society where there is zero tolerance for all forms of violence against women.  I hope that the strategy will be the most ambitious to date.  Realising this goal requires a range of actions and a collective effort.  In tandem with the strategy, we must also be part of a collective effort at an EU level.  I do not need to remind anyone how often the issue of violence against women comes to the fore.  There have been too many tragic cases and too many times where we have called for more to be done.  I have met many victims and their families.  The level of trauma and pain that they have experienced really cannot be described.<\/p> <p>Violence against women and domestic violence are pervasive throughout the EU.  It is estimated to affect one in three women, with one in five women having suffered domestic violence.  Looking at more specific types of violence, the Fundamental Rights Agency's 2014 EU-wide survey on violence against women outlined that one in ten women reported that they had been victims of sexual violence, and one in 20 women reported that they had been raped.  Cyberviolence is just as prevalent.  In 2020, it was estimated that one in two young women experienced gender-based cyberviolence.  It is well established that women in general more frequently experience cyberviolence based on their sex or gender, in particular sexual forms of cyberviolence.  Cyberviolence particularly impacts women who are active in public life, as many Senators in this House can probably attest to.  This can have the effect of silencing women, hindering their societal participation and undermining the principle of democracy as enshrined in the Treaty on European Union.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to say that many of the measures proposed in this directive are already part of Irish law, such as the offence of rape based on consent; the criminalisation of female genital mutilation; and the criminalisation of certain forms of cyberviolence.  The directive also calls for preventative measures, including by raising awareness and training professionals who are likely to come in contact with victims.  My Department regularly runs awareness campaigns in this space, including the Still Here campaign, which we ran during Covid restrictions and garnered very positive feedback.  The training of professionals is also a big aspect of Supporting A Victim's Journey, which is my plan to look at how we can improve the criminal justice system as it impacts victims.  In that regard, what is being proposed is not new for Ireland.<\/p> <p>The directive is comprehensive.  As such, there are some measures required that may require a tweak to existing law and practice.  As some measures are more targeted at civil law countries, they will need to be fully explored.  Since the UK's departure from the EU, Ireland is the sole country with the Protocol No. 21 article.  As such, it is essential that we utilise this at an early stage to ensure that we can participate in the discussions and that the final text of the directive takes account of our unique position as much as possible and is shaped to accommodate our common law system as much as possible.<\/p> <p>There is a strong reputational aspect to be considered for opting in to this directive.  Along with publication of the third national strategy, under Ireland's presidency of the Council of Europe I will host a conference of Council of Europe justice ministers on the topic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence this September.  Given the crossover of timelines between this opt-in and the new strategy, and the significant public attention on this issue in recent months, promoting work on this issue domestically but not agreeing to a common approach at EU level may appear contradictory to our EU partners, particularly at a time when solidarity is more important than ever.  Therefore, we should demonstrate to the EU how we are serious about tackling violence against women and domestic violence by utilising our Protocol No. 21 opt-in to participate in this measure.<\/p> <p>I commend the motion to the House and appreciate the flexibility with time shown by the Acting Chairperson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#YY00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Cuir&iacute;m f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

What is perhaps shocking is that it is the first piece, as the Minister said in her own words, of European Union legislation to recognise this area of criminality.  In many respects we in Ireland are used to taking our lead from Europe and being led by Europe in certain areas like employment law, health and safety law, and environmental law.  In this instance, I think we are a little bit ahead of the European Union curve.  The Minister deserves credit for the amount of legislation that we have seen, even in the last year or two since she became the Minister, that has actively pursued and put a lot of these matters on the Statute Book so that there is a clear recognition as a Government and Legislature, but also as a society, that the kind of behaviour that is the subject of this directive is not acceptable, and must be stamped out in no uncertain terms because it damages us all.<\/p> <p>The Minister talked about reputational damage.  Obviously that is at a very high level and it is entirely appropriate that Ireland should, to the greatest extent possible, lead the charge on this issue right down to the people who are affected by this kind of behaviour.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Everybody is affected in a pervasive way by domestic and gender-based violence, including children, women and anybody else in the home, as well as their neighbours, friends and family.  It is not just the victim or the person directly affected by the crime.  It is like a cancer since it spreads well beyond the direct victim of the crime.  There is no doubt that this motion is appropriate and supporting it would be in accordance with domestic legislation we have put in place already.  It is also appropriate in the context of Ireland's ratification of the Istanbul Convention.  The Minister said that some Council of Europe states are not yet signatories to the convention or are considering withdrawing from it.  I am proud that we are not among them.  The notion that countries are considering taking those steps, or not taking the step of ratifying the convention, says more about them than we know.<\/p><p>I am proud that Ireland has taken this issue by the horns and is willing to be at the forefront.  In recent months, the House passed a motion dealing specifically with violence against women and gender-based violence.  We have put our views on the record and clearly stated what we think about these issues.  This year alone, we have had some particularly horrific tragedies involving violence against women.  We did not need them to know there was a problem but they brought the issue, at the highest end of the scale, to the fore.  It is important to recognise that this kind of violence and the criminality that will be the target of this directive extends from one end of the spectrum right across to the psychological and repeated abuse of people in their own homes.  The latter may not grab headlines in the same way but it is incredibly damaging for all of us.  Realising that is tremendously important.<\/p><p>This is an important issue, which affects many of our family members, friends and colleagues.  The Minister cited statistics on the number of women who have been the victims of violence at some level.  They are targeted in different ways.  We need to put down a marker.  I like that Seanad has already passed motions on this issue  It is entirely sensible and consistent for us to support this motion and to exercise the option under protocol 21 to make sure that Ireland can lead on this as much as possible.  I commend the motion and the Minister on bringing it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#YY00400","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister, her husband Paul and baby Michael on their great news.  I wish her every good health in her pregnancy.<\/p> <p>I welcome this directive and support Ireland's opt-in to it.  While we have already implemented many of the laws and provisions mandated in the directive, our show of support for this move to combat violence against women across the EU is nonetheless important.  Incitement to hatred has been a criminal act in this country since 1989.  We criminalised the non-consensual sharing of intimate images only last year.  Our law prohibiting female genital mutilation was signed in 2012.  However, some fear there may have been a hidden spike in cases of female genital mutilation during the Covid-19 due to the lack of scrutiny in communities.  In the wake of those lockdowns, efforts must be redoubled to re-educate persons living in Ireland, who may come from or have ties to a country with a culture where female genital mutilation is practised, that it is illegal here and the consequences are severe.  Women and girls affected by female genital mutilation must also be able to visit any hospital and be seen by a doctor free of charge.<\/p> <p>Regarding the section on safe reporting and risk assessment procedures, there may be a slight concern regarding measures taken against suspects prior to trial.  This would be dealt with in national legislation.  We must ensure the balance between protection for those who may have been the victims of violence and the presumption of innocence.  I appreciate the inclusion of a reminder to member states that the competent authorities should take into account the fundamental right to freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 11 of the charter when assessing whether material qualifies amounts to incitement to hatred or violence.  That is another important area in which to ensure balance.<\/p> <p>All in all, I support this directive and the message it sends, that Europe is no place for the barbaric action that is prohibited by these laws and that we must work tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of our women and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister back to the House and congratulate her on her recent personal news.  I wish her and her family good health and happiness for the future.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I support this motion.  As the Minister said, it is good to see that we are not being led by the EU on this.  We are doing it ourselves and leading the way with legislation in this important area.  That is good to see.  Any additional measures that can be taken to protect women have to be taken.  Unfortunately, it is a women's issue, but those responsible for violence against women are predominantly men.  We men need to reflect on that.  To use the Minister's words, we need to ensure there is zero tolerance of domestic violence.  It is a major issue which affects the physical, emotional, social and financial well-being of individuals and their families.  It came more to the fore during the Covid pandemic when people were hemmed in.  My heart goes out to those women who were caught in such circumstances and felt helpless.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister on the work she has done in this area with colleagues from my party, specifically Senator Lisa Chambers who has done work in this area.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan issued a document earlier today.  It is not reactionary but would give us direction relating to violence against women and how as a society we should respond to that.<\/p> <p>The most important issue we have to bear in mind when it comes to violence against women is the provision of refuge.  While we are doing good work on refuge centres, as the Minister knows, there are nine counties in this State that have no safe house or refuge for women who find themselves in this position.  My home county, Monaghan, and County Cavan, are two counties where there is no refuge centre.  I came across a case recently where a lady simply had nowhere to go locally.  The issue has been compounded by the lack of housing and the arrival into our country of Ukrainian people.  While we are, rightly, doing our best to help them, their arrival has exacerbated the lack of accommodation.  We have a crisis due to the lack of accommodation.  I commend the members of Monaghan County Council who have come forward to offer a site for a refuge centre in Monaghan, which would also cover County Cavan.  I have met officials from Monaghan County Council about the issue a number of times.  I commend the members of the council and the executive who have stepped forward to offer help with providing a suitable site, or perhaps even a building, that would help women in this crisis situation.<\/p> <p>Work has been done to identify gaps in the provision of refuge centres.  Will the Minister comment on the progress of that work and the review?  When it is hoped that will be concluded?  The Government made a commitment.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, committed that he will not be found wanting once this review is complete.  Money is required to provide such a centre.  I am sure the Government, of which the Minister is a member, will not be found wanting.  It is a critically important issue which is more acutely felt due to the chronic lack of housing, not just in cities like Dublin and Cork but across the country.<\/p> <p>I would like to see progress on this issue and I would welcome comments from the Minister if she has an opportunity to contribute at the end of the debate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is about sending the message out to people that as far as we are concerned, and speaking as a man, there is absolutely no justifiable reason women should have to tolerate, or even live in fear of, possible violence against them.

I begin by welcoming the Minister and join colleagues in congratulating her and her family on her personal news.<\/p> <p>On International Women's Day this year the EU Commission published a proposal for a directive to combat violence against women and domestic violence through criminalisation of and sanctions for relevant offences, protection of victims, access to justice, victim support, prevention, co-ordination and co-operation.  The Commission has also proposed an EU-wide data collection obligation on member states, as there is currently inadequate data collected on violence against women across the EU.  That is also the case in this State.  There is already some cause for concern about the reaction to the Commission's proposal, with questions being asked about the need for it when we have the Istanbul Convention, which is a human rights treaty of the Council of Europe against violence against women and domestic violence.  However, six member states have yet to ratify the Istanbul Convention and the Polish Government moved legislation last year which, if passed, will see the country withdraw from the convention it ratified in 2015.<\/p> <p>The Minister has acknowledged this State is not meeting its obligations under the Istanbul Convention to provide adequate accommodation with wrap-around supports such as psychological care and childcare.  It is hardly an appropriate response to the convention that Tusla provides one third of the refuge places this State is obliged to provide and, as my colleague Senator Gallagher said, nine counties have no domestic violence refuges at all.  Both the Minister and Tusla's recently published review of emergency accommodation advise that the number and range of safe accommodation spaces available to victims of domestic violence needs to increase substantially to meet current needs, projected future needs and international obligations.<\/p> <p>The Court of Justice of the European Union published its opinion late last year regarding the convention, which has been blocked by some member states.  The court decided the Council can ratify the convention by a qualified majority.  This decision has been criticised for its ambiguity in stating: \"... nothing precludes the Council from extending its discussions in order to achieve ... closer cooperation between the Member States and the EU institutions in the process of concluding that agreement, which may involve waiting for the &lsquo;common accord&rsquo; [in other words, unanimity].\"  The Commission has said that its proposal for a directive: \"... is different to the Convention in that it sets minimum standards for EU Member States within the areas of EU competence, including the criminalisation of cyber violence offences that is not specifically covered by the Istanbul Convention\".<\/p> <p>While considerable progress has been made with respect to combatting violence against women and domestic violence, more needs to be done by this Government when the following points are taken into consideration.  The EU proposal provides for harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace, yet the Government has failed to endorse the International Labour Organization's Violence and Harassment Convention 2019 (No. 190) which aims to eliminate violence and harassment in the world of work.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, among others, has asked it to do so.<\/p> <p>The current programme for Government commits to examine the provision of domestic violence leave, yet there is no provision in the legislation as published.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020 is a comprehensive, robust and thorough piece of legislation, prepared in consultation with the domestic violence sector, to provide protections for employers in line with those contained in existing leave legislation.  If the Government's legislation to deliver on its commitment on domestic violence is not imminent, I urge the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to work with Deputy O'Reilly to progress the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill so we can collectively deliver on this entitlement on which we are all agreed.<\/p> <p>In supporting this motion I am mindful, as I said earlier, of the progress made and the need for more to be made in dealing with a range of related issues such as safe accommodation and other projects aimed at combatting violence against women and domestic violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#AAA00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I join others in congratulating the Minister on her great news and wish her and her family well.  I welcome this motion to opt in to the EU proposal for a directive on combatting violence against women and domestic violence and say \"well done\" to the Minister for all the great work she has done on the issue.<\/p> <p>Domestic violence is an absolute scourge and one that has certainly intensified during the pandemic.  There was a 43% increase in calls to Women's Aid from 2019 to 2020.  The increased time spent at home was a burden for us all but for many people it was profoundly dangerous and even lethal.  There have been several high-profile cases of femicide in recent years.  They were acts of brutality that highlight the continued dangers posed to women by male violence.  We have lost women like Nadine Lott, Seema Banu and her daughter, Asfira, and her son, Faizan.  These killings are senseless and incomprehensible and leave such extraordinary pain in their wake.  This should remind us that for many people, the family home is not a refuge from the challenges and hardships of the world but a volatile and frightening place where they can experience great instability and risk.  That absolutely 100% needs to change.<\/p> <p>There has been huge progress made on some fronts in tackling this issue.  The first successful prosecutions for coercive control are highly significant.  It is so important there is now an offence that captures the continuous and multifaceted oppression that characterises abusive relationships.  The roll-out of domestic violence training for some garda&iacute; has meant some victims receive much more support throughout their complaint process and this is no doubt welcomed.  However, the level of support victims can expect is still inconsistent.  That is the concern and it is totally unacceptable.  These are people at their most vulnerable who have overcome major psychological hurdles to take action to protect themselves and to make their abuser accountable.  They must be able to rely on support that is consistent, professional and victim-centred no matter where in Ireland they are and whoever happens to be dealing with them.<\/p> <p>I worry about the fallout of the cancelled 999 calls scandal and its impact on domestic violence in Ireland and worry for the victims whose calls were cancelled.  Were they able to get further help down the line?  Did they suffer further abuse in the interim?  I also worry about the damage it has done to victims' confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and whether it has produced a chilling effect for people reporting abuse.  I am aware there is an independent investigation into the issue under way, as well as an investigation into the effectiveness of Garda investigations of domestic abuse being conducted by the inspectorate.  I hope the results of these reviews will provide clarity, transparency and crucially accountability.<\/p> <p>Action must be taken in the spirit of this motion to increase the funding made available to groups providing services to victims of domestic and gendered violence and to expand access to safe refuges.  Currently, one third of counties have no safe refuges for women and there are no refuges for men who have been victims of domestic violence.  A lack of these refuges combined with the inaccessibility of housing creates a dangerous trap for victims of domestic violence.  When victims are faced with the prospect of homelessness and they feel forced to stay in abusive and dangerous situations this exposes them to further risks and sometimes ends tragically, as we all know.<\/p> <p>It is not just about using the right language or even passing the right laws to punish offenders - to truly tackle domestic violence and violence against women we need to create a society that provides the material basis of women's freedom.  That means having childcare, housing and healthcare that is accessible to everyone.  We need profound changes to address the route causes of this issue but this motion is definitely a step in the right direction and extremely welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#AAA00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the, I think, unanimous support for this motion.

In the finalisation of the strategy I have worked with my own Department; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Department of Health; the Department of Social Protection; the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; the Department of Defence; the Department of Education, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; the Department of Transport; the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage; and the Department of <font color=\"#202124\">Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media<\/font>.  A huge amount of work has been done, with quite a number of actions coming from all of the Departments. <br\/><br\/>I wish to specifically reference the work done in the area of refuge, as most Senators have raised the issue.  I am very much aware that the number of refuge places that we have, namely, 141, is not enough.  It is nowhere near enough.  There will be a very clear plan within the new strategy setting out our intention in that area in the short, medium and long term.  We must acknowledge that it will take time to develop.  There will be an increase in the number of refuge accommodation places and safe houses.  We will also look at other ways to keep people safe, whether it is at home or elsewhere.  There is an interdepartmental group which comprises my own Department, staff from Tusla and officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The group has looked at the current structure.  It has looked at how it works and how it does not work in terms of the development of new refuges and accommodation.  The group has also considered how we can change it, improve it, and how we can ensure that gaps can be filled in the counties where there is no refuge accommodation and also expand where we know there needs to be further development.  We are not just looking at women, which is the main focus.  We are also ensuring that support is provided for male victims.  That will very much be a key element of the strategy.  As I said, the publication of the strategy is imminent.  It will be published in the next few weeks.  I thank the Senators for their support.  They are doing their own work in this area.  As Senator Ward mentioned, the House has already passed motions on it.  The Senators have stated clearly that it is an issue that they want to deal with and to put on top of the agenda.

This motion is about supporting the Patients Deserve Better campaign, promoted by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, which is an umbrella group of the non-profit organisations that advocate for the rights of over 800,000 citizens living with neurological conditions.  The motion seeks to recognise that this is an issue.<\/p><p>I wish to state at the outset that I have discussed the motion with my colleagues across the House in the last few days, and it has received a most favourable response.  I do not think there is any division in this House about the absolute need to address the concerns in respect of the issue.Many organisations are tuning in to the debate today, including Aphasia Ireland, Ataxia Foundation Ireland, AFI, Enable Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, PSPA Ireland, the Migraine Association of Ireland, MS Ireland, the Parkinson's Association of Ireland and Beaumont Hospital.  There is a huge concern around the issue.  We only want to give voice to what is a really successful campaign that has been run by the group.  It has not been run by anybody else.  I wish to acknowledge that the group has collaborated well with Senators and Deputies across the Houses.  That is a measure of the success of the campaign.  <\/p><p>The Patients Deserve Better campaign addresses Ireland's shortage of over 100 neurological nurses.  There are currently 42 neurological nurses in Ireland.  International recommendations state that Ireland should have 142 such nurses.  The campaign decided to lobby on the issue, and it has lobbied very successfully.  It is important to acknowledge the professionalism of the campaign.  Looking at the campaign milestones, there have been six regional launches.  As we are all aware, the campaign has sent 11,000 targeted emails to Oireachtas Members.  The campaign has been involved in, and collaborated on, 140 parliamentary questions.  It has engaged with 83 Deputies and Senators on the various issues around the campaign.<\/p><p>It is important to note the campaign's achievements to date.  On 30 March 2022, the NAI received strong support for the campaign at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health.  That was a particularly important milestone.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the committee on the issue.  On 30 March 2022, the HSE confirmed that plans are in place to provide 16 additional nurse specialist in neurology services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is progress.

Neurology covers many issues and these nurses treat illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, severe cluster headaches, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and other rare diseases.  It is critically important that we get this number of nurses up.<\/p><p>The recommendations of the neurological centre are based on the recommendation ratio.  That is interesting.  I will call out a few of the hospitals because I like to deal in facts.  I thank the organisation for providing this information.  Of course, we validate that information, which is critically important to bring some sort of integrity to our own debate in these Houses.<\/p><p>We know that in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, the recommendation is 11 nurses.  Currently, there are three.  There is a shortfall of eight of these specialist nurses.  In Sligo University Hospital, very close to the Minister of State's constituency, the recommendation is seven nurses.  The current number is three, which is a shortfall of four.  In Cork University Hospital, CUH, the recommendation is 20 nurses; it only has four.  There is a shocking shortfall of 16.  We move on then to University Hospital Galway where the recommendation is 13 nurses; there are only four, leaving a shortage of nine nurses.  Then, we come to what should be and is a hospital of excellence but clearly needs all the support it can get in this particular area, namely, Beaumont Hospital, which is very much a leading hospital in this area.  The recommendation there is for 15 nurses. The current number is ten, which is a shortfall of five.  The recommendation for St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin is 22 nurses.  The current number is four, leaving a shortfall of 12.  I will wrap up with St. James's Hospital where the recommendation is 14 nurses.  The current number of nurses in this area is four, which is a shortfall of ten.  The recommendation for the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital is 14 nurses; it has six in place with a shortfall of eight.  Finally, the recommendation for Tallaght University Hospital is 20; it currently has in place 3.5 nurses, leaving a shortfall of 17.<\/p><p>I do not have to set it out much more plainly than that.  The Minister of State knows the importance of this area as someone with responsibility in the Department of Health.  What we are ultimately trying to achieve is support for the Patients Deserve Better organisation.  It has done a great job as an advocacy group.  Its representatives have connected with the practitioners.  They have huge support from the consultants in these hospitals.  It is important that we support them.<\/p><p>What is this motion calling for?  That is what it is all about.  We decided on a motion rather than some other piece of legislation because it is a particularly important issue.  Most Deputies and Senators spoke about the large numbers of emails and the concerns of particular hospitals.<\/p><p>I wish to single out, in particular, Senator Maria Byrne from County Limerick and her party.  She raised a number of issues and, indeed, she raised one yesterday in this House during Commencement matters, for which I was Acting Chairperson, on neurological support and nursing in her local university hospital.  She spoke passionately about the need to address this but also about a load of shortcomings in that hospital, which is not part of our remit tonight.  She made a very strong case, however, and a number of her own party Senators in this House and others across the floor did likewise.<\/p><p>Opposition is not just about opposing things.  I think the Senator appreciates that, as do we all.  We want to work constructively with the Government.  We want to use our time tonight to highlight those shortcomings.  As I said, we want to basically give voice to this enormous Patients Deserve Better campaign.<\/p><p>This motion calls for Government action to address the shortage of 100 neurological nurses, who are vital for patient care and the reduction of neurological waiting lists, which now stands at 24,000.  It is a shockingly big number, which we need to address.<\/p><p>The motion also calls on the Minister for Health to publish the Department's proposals to solve the shortfall in the provision of neurological nursing posts across Ireland's ten hospitals of neurological specialty and centres of excellence.  That is also a very focused ask.  We also seek in this motion for the Minister for Health to provide adequate budget funding for 2023 to provide the 100 additional neurological nurses nationwide in line with the research and recommendations of the Patients Deserve Better campaign.<\/p><p>I will hand over to my colleague, Senator McDowell.  However, I will wrap up by saying that this motion is motivated by collaboration.  It is about support and a focus on the shortcomings.  It is not about laying blame with anyone but about accepting and acknowledging that we are where we are today.  We really want change.  We are early enough out from the budget when, hopefully, Government and the lead Minister in the Department will be mindful of the ask.  I am hopeful and very confident that we will have the support of all Members in this House tonight for this important motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#CCC00200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>It is an honour to second the motion that Senator Boyhan has brought before the House.  I wish to say a few words to re-emphasise what he said.  This is not point-scoring against the present Government .  This is looking at a deficit that exists in the health system in Ireland.  We are not moving this motion in a negative or carping spirit at all.  We are endorsing the campaign for an increase in the resources that are going towards neurological nursing in Ireland and a recruitment and training campaign to make sure we have adequate numbers of neurologically-trained nurses.<\/p> <p>As we all know, neurology is a developing science.  We are now beginning to understand in ways we did not before just how much suffering is caused and damage done by neurological disease.  Research must be there, of course, and there are some signs already.  I listened to a BBC radio report today about some of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and the question of vascularisation of certain areas of the brain.  Research is going on right across the board with regard to some of these scourges that affect our society.  One of the people involved in that research said that if we can tackle that particular condition, for instance, we can improve the standard of life for people in their 70s and 80s - I am now 70 myself, actually 71 now that I think about it - in order that towards the end of a person's natural lifespan, he or she does not suffer from neurological or vascular problems or whatever if the proper research is done.<\/p> <p>As Senator Boyhan said, it is hugely important not merely that we have the specialist posts filled but that we also have a cohort of nursing staff who can support them.  There is a limit to what specialists can do in terms of treating patients if they do not have the valuable support of the nursing profession.  It is a question of training and making resources available for those positions.  It is also a question of retaining the people who are skilled in those areas and ensuring their skills remain in this country.<\/p> <p>Sometimes, I think there are some fundamental problems with the health service in Ireland.  I am not happy that between consultants and non-consultants, we have arrived at a happy system of providing in-hospital medical attention at the doctor level.  I do not really believe there is a pathway to promotion or pathway to excellence for many of our non-consultant hospital doctors.  There is to some extent a two-tier profession in existence.  I am fully in favour of people going abroad to get valuable and absolutely necessary expertise but it does sometimes strike me as odd that we have people in Ireland who are trapped at a certain level.  There is a glass ceiling above them.  They are asked to work extremely hard to keep our hospital system going.  I have no doubt the same would apply to the nursing profession.  Nurses are in demand worldwide, particularly skilled Irish nurses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have to provide career paths that satisfy patient needs in Ireland.<\/p><p>In a constructive spirit, I endorse everything Senator Boyhan has done.

We will take three minutes each.  I thank my Independent colleagues for tabling this motion.  I remind Senator Boyhan that I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted the lack of neurological nurses in the mid-west and nationally on the Order of Business and through Commencement matters.  I very much support the Patients Deserve Better campaign.  I acknowledge Alison Cotter of MS Ireland who is in the Chamber and who worked for me previously.  I know the great work MS Ireland does and how its work could be greatly enhanced if there were more neurological nurses.<\/p> <p>Some of us were at the briefing last Wednesday.  It was a very powerful briefing in which a young lady from Galway in her early 20s very powerfully presented on the difference availability of and access to neurological nurses would make to the lives of people of her age.  There was also an older, although not elderly, gentleman with Parkinson's disease who had a very similar story to tell.  What was very powerful were the parallels between these two people's experience.  Despite their different ages and coming from different generations, their stories were the same.  They spoke about living independently and being able to lead full, equal, accessible and fulfilled lives.  That is what step-down neurological nurses in the community who visit people in their homes, engage with them and take phone calls mean for people.  That is the difference.  We talk about primary care in the community, supporting people to live in their homes and how much more cost-effective that is than having them in nursing homes, care facilities and so on.  That is what we need to achieve.  The vast majority of people can live in their homes if the proper supports are in place.<\/p> <p>I ran a campaign in this House for a number of years to have eye clinic liaison officers appointed to the hospital groups so that, when people are diagnosed with sight loss, there would be a person available to them who had all of the knowledge and contacts with step-down facilities, including everything from peer counselling to guide dogs and mobility training.  They would know the NGOs and who was good at what.  This was run on a pilot basis in Temple Street hospital.  Referrals went up 66% and the net result was that people felt they were able to adjust to their new circumstances more quickly and that they could contribute more to society.  In some cases, people who did not have access to this programme never felt they could contribute and fell into the cracks.  As a result of this campaign, largely run by me in this House and through the Joint Committee on Health, there will now be eye clinic liaison officers in every hospital group in the country.  This means that, as our population becomes elderly and their vision naturally starts to become impaired, there will be somebody who knows how to navigate and help them.  I see this campaign for neurological nurses as being something similar, although probably in a more advanced clinical setting.  It would give people with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis somebody to talk to and a link or contact, somebody with knowledge and experience who can be a support.  In some cases, just knowing that such a person is there is liberating.  <\/p> <p>From my personal experience of the Minister of State, who has been my colleague for nearly 15 years, I know how committed he is to equality.  I know that, when he goes into the Department of Health and takes part in the process of negotiating the budget, preparing the Estimates and considering the various demands that are on the table at budget time, he will fight tooth and nail for an increase.  Nobody expects 100 extra nurses to be provided in budget 2023 but there should be a legitimate expectation that 30 or 35 nurses would be provided, or at least that this number of positions would be funded.  The challenge is then hiring neurological nurses because it is a very distinct and specialised sphere.  It will not be easy.  If the Department could even give an indication that this is going to happen, the wheels could be put in motion to start the recruitment process, which will be difficult in itself.  <\/p> <p>I commend my colleagues.  They are using Seanad time in a very clear and compassionate way that will achieve a result.  Well done.  I am very happy to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#EEE00400","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Senator Conway has not left very much time for Senator Buttimer to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#EEE00500","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

We need the Minister and the Department to ensure that there are no obstacles to the HSE drawing down money to recruit and train these nurses.  By the HSE's reckoning, we have approximately 30% of the specialist neurology nurses that we need, which is making their job difficult.  We need 100 more.<\/p><p>Over the past two years, budgets have promised thousands of staff, but they have not materialised.  It is vital that these 100 nursing posts are allocated and filled.  Specialist nursing staff are needed to manage long-term neurological conditions, monitor patients, adjust medication amounts and prevent unnecessary hospital admissions.  Having nursing capacity in the system to support consultants would reduce the need for outpatient consultants and free up staff time to get through waiting lists.  There are more than 23,000 patients on neurology waiting lists, yet only some of these nursing posts have been sought to be filled this year.  That is not good enough.  The Minister and the HSE need to ensure that there are no obstacles to drawing down the full funding required for recruiting and training nurses for these posts.<\/p><p>I commend the motion and am proud to give it Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support.

This motion is reasonable and one that I wish to support.<\/p> <p>Sometimes, I feel sorry for a Minister coming to the House to take a motion like this, given that the problems that we are discussing have been endemic in the health system as far back as I remember.  On Sunday, I listened to Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  She was speaking about the shortage of nurses in accident and emergency departments, and as I listened to her, I thought back.  The first time I became aware of a problem with staffing &ndash; I am referring to the medics at the coalface &ndash; in the health system was when I was ten years old and stuck in a bed in the middle of the long ward on the second floor of what was then Galway Regional Hospital because the hospital was overcrowded.  It is a long time since I was ten years old, but nothing has changed, so the Minister of State is not responsible.  However, he has the opportunity to make changes, which is what we are discussing.  I also thought back to my cousin, Ms Kathleen Craughwell, a president of what was the Irish Nurses Organisation, INO, some years ago.  I remembered speaking to her about shortages in nursing and nursing care.  My wife is a nurse.  She worked in the accident and emergency department in Galway, where the staff were always run off their feet.<\/p> <p>The nursing profession has never managed to retain in the Irish system the excellent people we have trained and educated.  As Senator McDowell stated, we train them to the highest level and make them attractive to health services all over the world.  It is great for people to go away, build up the requisite level of experience and bring that back to this country.  The problem is that the system is under such strain that none of these excellent people wants to return.  They want to stay in health services where they are not constantly under pressure and doing the job of more than one person.<\/p> <p>If there is the correct staffing, with qualified nurses supporting consultants in neurology, outpatient time can be reduced by 40%.  Medication changes are required in neurology.  A member of my family suffers epilepsy and a change of medication is a serious matter, given some of the side effects and changes involved in the transition periods between one drug and another.  From that point of view, we need experts &ndash; nurses &ndash; on whom we can call.<\/p> <p>I once spent four months in Tallaght University Hospital.  I saw my consultant twice per week &ndash; he was an excellent and wonderful man &ndash; but I saw my nurses several times every day.  They were the people who were the consultant's eyes and ears and could tell him what was happening.  We undervalue nurses.<\/p> <p>There is a recommendation of 20 nurses in this specialism in Cork University Hospital but a shortfall of 16.  There is a shortage of 17 at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in Dublin and 17 at Tallaght.  These organisations are under severe pressure.  I invite the Minister of State to visit the neurological outpatient clinic at Tallaght hospital to see how under pressure its nurses are.  There are so few of them.  The Minister of State knows how an outpatient clinic works &ndash; the consultant comes in and everything has to be ready to move because the consultant&rsquo;s time is limited.  From this point of view, having the necessary staff is important.<\/p> <p>Other Senators will call on the Minister of State for additional resources for accident and emergency services, urology and so on, but we must step back and ask ourselves how we have not brought matters to a better conclusion in the 50 plus years I have referenced.<\/p> <p>People have been speaking to me about various issues that I have raised in the House, search and rescue services being one.  The Minister of State and I debated that issue as a Commencement matter a couple of days ago.  Another is the Commission on the Defence Forces, with people telling me that we cannot spend money on defence because we need it for hospitals and education.  Finland, an economy much the size of ours, has an excellent education system, an excellent military and an excellent health system.  Something is wrong somewhere and we are going to have to step back and see what it is.  The people who represent voluntary organisations are doing a fantastic job, but they need support.  We need to step back and see how we can fix matters for them, because the current situation is terrible.<\/p> <p>I commend my colleagues, Senators Boyhan and McDowell, on the leadership they have given on this matter.  I thank the party spokespersons who have contributed for their commitment to an Independent Group motion.

Last week, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and I raised hospital services in a timely Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>The Patients Deserve Better campaign is not just about highlighting the need for extra nurse specialists to be put in place; it is about the model of care that we want in neurological services.  I am a simple and ordinary person and, to me, neurological care is about looking after people with different conditions, but the term &ldquo;neurological care&rdquo; does not cover what we are discussing now.  This motion is about quality of care, access to therapy and services and the additional nurse specialists that are required.  It is also about ensuring that we examine the issue of waiting lists and neurological services as a whole.<\/p> <p>The HSE has become good at saying &ldquo;the pandemic has delayed&rdquo; or &ldquo;the pandemic has paused&rdquo;.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We accept that it has, but we cannot hide behind the pandemic for everything.  I thank everybody present tonight who is working with people on the ground.  We are talking about people here.  The key points from tonight's debate relate to there being four nurse specialists when there should be 20, and the shortage of 16 people to provide essential care to those with neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis.<\/p><p>If I may digress for a second, one of our ushers, Mr. Darren Fitzgerald, is in the House tonight.  Last year, he created a significant amount of publicity around his 65 Holes for 65 Roses campaign to support Cystic Fibrosis Ireland and working for his daughter, Caoimhe.  What Darren did was unbelievable.  He took the person and made the story about the delivery of services.  To be fair to Senator Boyhan, that is what this motion is about.  He is right that it is not political but is about the people.  It is the story of Darren and Caoimhe we should focus on.  Equally, it is Mr. Declan Greogor in Cork and Mr. Tony Wilkinson of Cork Parkinson's Association we should be talking about in the context of the advocacy and work they have been doing.  I referenced their remarks and contributions in the House last week, as did Senator O'Donovan.  For example, hiring just one nurse who specialises in the condition of Parkinson's would save the HSE &euro;300,000 a year.  That is just one part of it.  Mr. Declan Groeger said: \"I'm not looking for someone 24\/7 ... What the nurse would mean to me is that I could contact them when I have a particular issue.\"  That is the second part; it is about quality of life.<\/p><p>I had the unfortunate privilege to be in Cork University Hospital for a period earlier this year with my late father.  The continuum of care was unbelievable.  The accident and emergency department was full but the care given was brilliant.  The level of care and communication in the ward my father was in was phenomenal.  We are talking about people who want to live life with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis or whatever.  To be fair to the Minister of State, he challenges officials every day in his Department.  This particular issue is probably not within his exact remit but there is a gap and lacuna in the provision of services for those with neurological conditions.  Yesterday, Senator Blaney, in his contribution on the Electoral Reform Bill, spoke about the need for Oireachtas representatives, who in many cases have previously been members of local authorities where we had to access to information and officials.  With the greatest will in the world, the quarterly briefing with HSE people is not enough in itself.  Tonight, in a unified Upper House, we are sending a message not just to the Government but to the HSE that the lacuna in the care of people with neurological conditions is unacceptable and we want to see it addressed.<\/p><p>I again thank the Independent Group for its motion.  I certainly hope we will not oppose it because we should not.  It is an important one that is about people.  My final remarks are for those in the advocacy groups who are working so hard.  I thank them.  Their voice was most definitely heard on this particular matter because they made it personal.  I thank them all for that tonight.  It is an important matter and I thank the Acting Chairperson for her indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#FFF00300","speaker":"1637","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to the Independent Group for tabling this motion.

The list goes on.  The work these nurses do in helping to support neurology patients is crucial.  Their expertise even allows them to intervene to avoid hospital admissions.  One study showed that where people had access to specialised nurses, less pressure was put on emergency services, meaning there were less hospital admissions and it cost less money.  At a time when our emergency departments are almost crippled due to the immense pressure of Covid and other issues, such as bed shortages and lengthy waiting times, more neurology nurses have the potential to benefit not only patients but the HSE as a whole.<\/p> <p>We are far below internationally recommended ratios for specialist neurology nurses.  There are currently only 42 in the Irish health system and, according to national and international recommendations, we need at least 142.  That is a shortfall of 100 nurses.  St. James's Hospital is the main neurology centre in my constituency.  It urgently needs at least ten extra neurology nurse specialists.  I have received emails from constituents who are very concerned as patients are unnecessarily waiting longer for diagnosis and treatment.  Based on the catchment area, national and international guidelines recommend there should be 14 neurology nurse specialists but there are only four.  These patients deserve better.<\/p> <p>Many of the neurology departments are based in Dublin.  If we move outside Dublin, with the cost of hotel rooms skyrocketing and the price of fuel going up, patients who need urgent care can barely afford to access it.  We need to focus on these facilities being located throughout the country so they are more accessible.  The Minister of State is currently in budget negotiations for his Department.  I ask that over the summer he has a look to see if he can get an additional budget for 20 extra nurses to be added to neurology facilities throughout the country in order to at least begin to ease the burden on our health system and bring us up to international standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#GGG00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate the Independent Group on tabling this very important motion.  It addresses a very worthy topic and a series of facts and conditions that can affect any family at any time.  Neurological conditions can strike very suddenly.  Strokes and acquired brain injuries can happen all of a sudden.  Any of us present could get a phone call at any time to tell us very difficult and tragic news about a family member, friend or neighbour.  It is a real problem and a life-changing issue, and a series of life-changing events resonate from it within one's family.<\/p> <p>I lost an uncle this year who had two strokes last year.  He was 89 years old and would have been 90 in June.  He had lived his life but there are people who suffer health impacts in their 30s and 40s who would have had a whole life in front of them.  Certainly, those people's lives and those of their loved ones are more impacted by these issues.  My father died in 2018 of a neurological issue for which we never really got a diagnosis.  It is something that impacts so much on life.  It is very debilitating and requires help and assistance when it gets to the stage of the affected person returning home, if he or she can return home.  In some cases, that is obviously not practical and people end up in permanent care.  That differs depending on one's family circumstances.<\/p> <p>I fully support the campaign.  I have spoken to that at the Joint Committee on Health.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I welcome the progress this year.  There is a campaign for extra nurses in Galway, where there should be 13 neurological nurse specialists but there are only four.  The Department and the Minister should be working towards an incremental approach to increase the numbers over a period to reach an acceptable level.  I certainly hope we will see additional progress this year.  In the western region, three extra nursing positions are due to be filled this year at University Hospital Galway, UHG, and that is welcome.  I hope that can be replicated next year and the year after to get to the acceptable level.<\/p><p>As the motion states, there is a shortfall of up to 100 neurological nurses in Ireland based on national and international guidelines relative to population.  People with long-term neurological conditions have limited access to the neurology nursing services that help them to manage their condition.  This is something that is very important to the patients who are affected, their families, their loved ones and those around them.  As I said, I feel for younger people, in particular, who may have small children and who may leave a partner having to deal with all the pressures and stresses of life in addition to dealing with somebody who suffers a debilitating condition in this regard.  I hope and expect the Government, subject to the availability of specialists to be recruited and adequate training programmes, to ensure we have an adequate cohort of people who can be put in place across the system.  I certainly hope we can put a plan in place in the shortest term possible to reach a stage where an adequate number of neurology nurses can be acquired.  I support the call for the Minister to prioritise funding for additional nurses in budget 2023.  Ideally, it would be 100 in one go if they were available, although that might not be practical, but certainly he should go some way to ensuring that we can reach that milestone in as short a period of time as possible.<\/p><p>I again commend the Independent Senators on tabling this important motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#GGG00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I commend the Independent Senators on putting this motion forward.  There is no question that there is an incredible shortage of neurology nurses throughout the State.  However, I wish to mention something that I am sure Members have mentioned, although I apologise that I have not been able to follow the debate.  It is essential that in places such as St. James's Hospital we have an additional ten neurology nurses at the very minimum.  Such a leading centre in the country having a shortfall has a devastating effect on families and most particularly on patients.  It is absolutely essential for the support of individuals and we must be creative in how we ensure we have enough people qualified and enough people coming into the country.  We have to look at this from the flow of where we are drawing our neurology nurses from and whether we are supporting that as a choice for specialist training.  We need to examine that and I urge that we do so.  Most particularly, we must put the funding and support in place to ensure we have an adequate complement of neurology nurses throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022062200002#HHH00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1655888400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Boyhan and McDowell for tabling this motion.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Government.  Senators O'Donovan and Buttimer had a Commencement matter on this issue last week.  It also has been raised by many other Senators and Deputies in the Houses.<\/p> <p>The motion highlights the Patients Deserve Better campaign, promoted by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and its partners, which is calling for an additional 100 neurology nurses in our hospitals.  The Government is not opposing the motion, as it aims to support neurology services.  However, it is incumbent on me to point out that, as with all health workforce expansion requests, bids for additional nursing and midwifery personnel will be considered and addressed in the context of the Department of Health&rsquo;s ongoing workforce planning considerations as well as the annual Estimates and budgetary processes.  These considerations aim to address, in an appropriate fashion, the many competing needs of the health and social care system.  Many of the Senators have asked me, in my capacity as Minister of State in the Department of Health, to support this and I have no problem doing that within the Department.<\/p> <p>I thank Senators Boyhan and McDowell and other Senators for the way they conducted this debate.  There was no point scoring and it was very constructive and informative.  That is a good way of addressing a very complex and important issue.  The motion provides me with the opportunity to discuss the important work under way in neurology services.  Indeed, many of the Senators have already highlighted that.  Senator Clifford-Lee spoke about the great work that is being done in Beaumont Hospital in her area.  She also appropriately referred to the many people who were here tonight who have a huge interest in health.  Senator Craughwell spoke about being a ten-year-old many years ago.  He said it was 50 years ago; I would have thought it was perhaps a little longer, but the Senator may answer that himself.  He highlighted the great work that his family had done in the IMO and in many other areas.<\/p> <p>Deputy Colm Burke held a meeting here over a week ago and it highlighted a very pertinent issue for Members of the Oireachtas.  It is a very good way of informing Deputies, Senators and Ministers.  Unfortunately, I was unable to attend it, but I followed the social media on it and I raised my support.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan spoke about the briefings.  A lot of the time there are people who can lobby.  Over the years we have had the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Pharmacy Union and many others.  This has been a very effective - I will not call it a lobby group - information campaign which has caught the imagination of Deputies and Senators.  It should take a bow.  It is a very good way to lobby.  It was not confrontational; it was informative.  If one wants something done, one should bring people along.  That is very effective.  Senator Kyne talked about the campaign, his family, issues in Galway and the personal experience.  That was an interesting and emotive way of addressing this debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about the importance of St. James's Hospital.  Everybody is looking for extra nurses in their areas, and that is to be commended.  Sligo was mentioned as well.  We all want to get more nurses than we have, and the more placements we can have, the more areas will benefit.  I thank Senator Warfield.  We worked closely together in the Seanad and I thank him for raising these issues.  Some Members talked about qualifications, people coming into the country and the choice of training.  That is a pertinent issue.  Mr. Darren Fitzgerald was mentioned as well, and the great work he did with his daughter, Caoimhe.  Again, it certainly raised a lot of information on the issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frankie Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is the right way to do it.<br\/><br\/>There is no doubt that neurology nurse specialists play a significant role in the triaging, assessment, treatment and delivery of care for ongoing support of neurology patients.  Neurology is a very important branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system, including the brain, brain stem, spinal cord, root, plexus, peripheral nerves and muscles.<br\/><br\/>Importantly, the HSE's national clinical programme for neurology engages regularly with patient organisations, including the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, to identify service requirements and patient demand for neurology nurse specialists.  In this regard, the executive's clinical programme is focusing its current workstreams and initiatives on nurse-led clinics, nurse liaison services and outreach programmes.  Examples of this work include the headache programme and the epilepsy outreach programme, both funded under the Sl&aacute;intecare innovation fund.  These programmes reconfigure the management of the conditions, enabling clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners to lead and co-ordinate the care related to the conditions in the community.  This reduces demand on consultant neurologists and tertiary services appropriately and safely, which allows more timely access to services and improves the overall quality of care for patients.<br\/><br\/>With regard to workforce planning, ensuring an appropriate pipeline of suitably qualified healthcare professionals in Ireland is a top priority.  However, it is important to recognise that this is set against a global shortage of healthcare professionals, including nursing and midwifery.  The Department of Health is engaging with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and other relevant stakeholders regarding a strategic approach to workforce planning and future skills needs.  Progress is being made on increased numbers of undergraduate places across many health care professions, including nursing.  Senator Maria Byrne raised the issues in her area in Limerick last week.  I thank her for doing so again.<br\/><br\/>The HSE is developing a strategic programme of work to enable the health services to attract, develop and retain the workforce needed to meet the demand both now and into the future.  There is work under way on the recruitment of nursing staff, including specialist nurse campaigns launched nationally and internationally for clinical nurse specialists and advance nurse practitioners.  This is supported by the policy on graduate, specialist and advanced nursing and midwifery practice, which provides a clear framework for the development of specialist and advanced roles.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Health has also commenced a project, Health and Social Care Workforce Planning in Ireland, to address the long-term workforce planning needs of the health sector generally.  This work is being undertaken with the support of the European Commission Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support and is being undertaken to develop a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan and a planning projection model for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of Health also published the Report of the Expert Review Body on Nursing and Midwifery 2022, which sets out a pathway for developing and strengthening the role of the nurse and midwife.  The House may be aware that the Minister has accepted all 47 recommendations in the report.  This will support nurses and midwives to continue to learn and develop in professional roles, enabling significant reform aligned with population health needs and ensuring that critical Sl&aacute;intecare priorities are realised.<br\/><br\/>In terms of funding an increase in the healthcare workforce, I am pleased to inform the House that budget 2022 provides funding for a large expansion of the workforce, of up to an additional 11,369 whole-time equivalents, reflecting the ambition and desire of Government to invest in Ireland's health services and ensure services are fully and safely staffed.  A total of 12,506 whole-time equivalents were hired in 2020 and 2021.  The year 2020 saw the largest increase in staffing since the foundation of the HSE, and 2021 saw the second largest.  The largest area of growth in 2020 and 2021 was in nursing and midwifery, with an additional 3,372 whole-time equivalent posts, or a 9% total growth in numbers.<br\/><br\/>The motion refers to the waiting list for neurology outpatient appointments.  It is important to say that the 2022 waiting list action plan for the health services was published on 25 February last and is now being implemented.  Through this plan, the Government has provided &euro;350 million in 2022 to reduce waiting lists and waiting times for scheduled care.  The plan includes several proposals from the HSE to address the outpatient neurology waiting list.  This additionality is in the form of both once-off activity to address the backlog and proposals for recurring activity to meet ongoing demand for neurology services.  It is significant that, in total, 3,230 additional neurology outpatient appointments will be delivered by the end of 2022 through once-off funding.  An additional 9,140 appointments could be provided each year upon approval and the roll-out of improved patient pathways, in addition to linked recurring activity associated with the acute hospital waiting list plan.  It is important to point out that these additional activity levels do not include HSE proposals for active clinical prioritisation, which will also help to improve waiting times for patients on neurology waiting lists.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in the community, the HSE's implementation framework for the neuro-rehabilitation strategy was launched in February 2019.  The aim of the implementation framework is the development of neuro-rehabilitation services that will improve patient outcomes by providing safe, high-quality, person-centred neuror-ehabilitation at the lowest appropriate level of complexity.  The framework also describes a managed clinical rehabilitation network demonstrator project, which is currently progressing through the development of post-acute and community neuro-rehabilitation services, with<b><\/b>full-year funding of &euro;2.29 million available from 2021.  This funding will mean that approximately 40 patients per annum will have their rehabilitation needs met in an appropriate setting outside acute hospitals.<br\/><br\/>In spite of the many challenges facing the health services today, the workforce and budgetary planning under way in the Department aims to address, in an appropriate fashion, the many competing needs of the health and social care systems.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Senators again for tabling the motion.  It was very constructive, as was the debate.  We learned all about the issues in the mid-west.  We heard from Senators Conway and Maria Byrne, who referred to Limerick, and we also heard about Galway, Beaumont and St. James's hospitals.  I thank Senators Boyhan and McDowell for tabling the motion.  I understand Ms Alison Cotter was mentioned earlier.  I thank her for the work she has done with her colleagues.  The campaign has been very interesting and informative.  Work is under way in the neurology service, including on recruitment.  There are many challenges.  I thank the Senators for the opportunity to contribute and, most important, for their very constructive and challenging contributions.  It is great to be back here in the Seanad.

Phoning a neurological nurse can solve their issues or give them the advice needed.  I welcome what the Department is doing on waiting lists, which is an enormous issue.  The provision of these nurses needs to become a priority for the Department, not just in University Hospital Limerick and the mid-west, but nationally.  We face a crisis in many hospitals with people on trolleys, people on waiting lists and people having to go in because their issue cannot be dealt with elsewhere.  Having more neurological nurses would certainly help to reduce the waiting lists and also the amount of time people spend in hospital.<\/p><p>I firmly support the motion and welcome the debate we have had this evening.
