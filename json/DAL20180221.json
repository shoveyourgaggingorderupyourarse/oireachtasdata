There is a problem in accessing, through freedom of information requests, data on the inspections that have been carried out.  Repeatedly, various groups, including the ISPCA, have been denied information, obtainable through freedom of information requests, on quite spurious grounds.  More fundamentally, there is need to crack down on and eliminate industrial-style breeding.  In Victoria in Australia, for example, the maximum number of breeding bitches allowed is ten.

There is bad weather etc. so councils are rushing to get work done at the end of the year.  It is welcome that this year's allocation will be announced earlier.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme should not be underestimated, as it provides valuable access for people in rural areas who cannot get to a main road.  Generally speaking, the local authority would not be in a position to fund repairs to such roads.  I found myself on a lane in the past number of days that had approximately ten people living on it.  An old person lives at the very end of the lane but the local doctor and public health nurse have not been in a position to visit the person at the end of the lane, who was sick, because the surface is so bad.

Applications are up 70% on previous years.  Spending in 2017 amounted to almost &euro;2.7 million, compared to the &euro;1.8 million spent in 2016.  During 2017, over 12,600 applications were approved and more than 10,100 installations were completed.

A Programme for a Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development both commit to progressing the concept of the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ring, established the AEC task force in March 2017 to progress this proposal and I now chair this task force.  The role of the task force is to provide strategic oversight and direction in developing the AEC concept, which was initially brought by local chambers of commerce along the west coast and the American Chamber of Commerce.  A key objective of the task force is to ensure that the existing resources and skills within the region can be supported and assessed.  The task force includes representatives from the business sector, key Departments and Government agencies, local authorities and third level institutions.  It is the key mechanism for engaging with and building collaboration between stakeholders.  Two subgroups of the task force are now in place, one considering infrastructural investment priorities and the other covering the issue of enterprise property capacity in the region.  A third group, covering communications, has also been established.  These task groups are composed of members of the task force itself and provide a more focused platform for consideration of key issues relating to the development of the AEC.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's Project Ireland 2040 plan, published last Friday, fully supports the development of the AEC, which I welcome.  It specifically highlights the contribution that the AEC can make to achieving the regional growth objectives of the national planning framework.  In order to further support the AEC proposal, I have offered to co-fund the appointment of an AEC officer in each of the local authorities along the corridor.  That will include the local authorities in Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway city and county, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo and Donegal.  We have written to the chief executive officers, CEOs, and local authorities in that regard.  This will provide a dedicated resource in each local authority to support the work of the AEC task force and its subgroups and to promote the AEC concept within each local authority area and across the region as a whole.  I welcome the AEC initiative.  We all know there is a great capacity in the west coast as a counterbalance to the Dublin region and it was welcome to see that that was key to the national planning framework and to Project Ireland 2040, published last Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100011#J01500","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1519213500,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his answer.

It was estimated that up to 25,000 people were on Versatis patches and the Government has, by reducing the number of patches available by 90%, also reduced the cost by 90%.  It has taken a vital medicine away from 90% of its users, for whom it was essential in their daily lives.  These people are in chronic pain and it is the equivalent of shutting down the emergency department of each sufferer across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The individual testimonies are heart-rending.  For example, Catherine Carroll said every day is like a living hell and that the pain is unbearable.  She cannot use other pain medicines because of complications.  Ann Nolan Walsh tells the story of her 100 year old father, who was taken off the patches and is now in extreme pain, even from just trying to get out of bed.  Barbara Donehy, a founding member of Patch Us Back Up, says sufferers do not live anymore but are existing day by day, and Jennifer O'Meara cannot even do things with the children.  Her engagement with family life has been severely restricted by being taken off the patches as a result of this decision.<\/p>  <p>  The \"Liveline\" programme, and its presenter Joe Duffy, has been the real patient advocate on this issue and hundreds of people have been in touch with the programme about it.  There has been no bigger case for \"Liveline\" than this issue in terms of sufferers contacting the programme and that tells us something about the reaction to this decision across the country.  These people, who are all in acute pain, contacted the programme to tell their own personal stories and to reveal their anger and disbelief.  This patient evidence has been ignored.<\/p>  <p>  John Lindsay, of Chronic Pain Ireland, says people in Ireland are in chronic pain and are suffering.  He makes the point that there was no research and no thinking through of the decision.  The suddenness was incredible and has caused enormous difficulty and pain for many people.  This was about cutting costs but, overnight, it has visited great trauma on many families and thousands of people across the country.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to intervene to suspend this decision of the HSE and to put the patient at the centre of the issue, rather than on the periphery as has been the case to date.  I ask them to do due diligence to enable people to get their lives back together again, to live meaningful lives and to live again as they had lived while on the patches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100012#K00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519214100,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I have heard the harrowing stories on the radio and many people have contacted me personally about this issue.  As a result of the concerns expressed, and the personal stories of people in terrible pain, I endeavoured to look into it and discussed it in detail with the Minister for Health last week.  It is important that we fully understand and are honest about the background to this issue.<\/p><p>This is a medicine and these are patches that are licensed for one purpose only, which is post-shingles pain in adults.  It is to be given to adult patients who have localised pain after having had shingles.  Unfortunately, over the course of the past number of years, many doctors have been prescribing it for an off-licence use, for other uses for which it is not licensed.  That is a legitimate medical practice in certain circumstances but there need to be some controls around this practice because people can become dependent on such medicines.  It is an anaesthetic and not something one should prescribe lightly.  Long-term use of anaesthetics can have consequences for people.  They can become dependent on them and there are other long-term side effects.  There is no problem when GPs prescribe this medicine for the thing it is licensed for in Ireland, which is post-shingles pain in adults, but if they are going to prescribe it for a purpose that is unlicensed, they have to go through some sort of procedure to ensure it is done safely and I do not think anybody should be against that.  It is not simply a matter of money.  It is also a matter of patient safety.<\/p><p>This patch was being prescribed ten times as much, <i>per capita<\/i>, in Ireland as it was in the UK and there is something seriously wrong when a medicine is being used ten times as much here as in a very similar country such as the one over the water.  That is because it was being prescribed for a use for which it was not licensed and without any sort of controls.  From the point of view of patient safety, it was the right thing to do to make sure that, if GPs and other doctors are prescribing this medicine for a purpose for which it is not licensed, there should be some controls around it.  That is what the HSE has done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100012#K00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519214100,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I do not accept that.

Dr. John Goddard, a researcher in Sheffield, published an article in the <i>Pain Medicine<\/i>journal, identifying a 70% effective rate for juveniles who used Versatis patches.  He points out the difficulty with researching pain and identifying the optimal treatments for people.<\/p><p>I did not just speak to GPs but spoke to a woman this morning whose consultant, having done all the epidurals and beta-blockers etc., recommended Versatis patches.  The casual, arbitrary, sudden and overnight nature of this decision was appalling and was not about patient safety.  As John Lindsay said, in any other jurisdiction they know that taking people off a medication so suddenly can be injurious to them and damaging to patients.<\/p><p>The time for explanations is over.

Another 4,784 patients were registered by their GPs for uses other than post-shingles pain and 14% of these patients - 670 - have been approved.

It is, however, a cause of clinical concern and a real patient safety concern, that usage spiralled so much that we reached the point where there were ten times as many patches in use in Ireland per head of population.  Details of the changes were circulated to prescribers and pharmacies in August 2017 to give clinicians time to inform their patients about the changes and where appropriate to change the treatment or to seek continued treatment.  Under these new arrangements all patients who are receiving lidocaine plasters for a licensed indiction were automatically approved.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community drug schemes.  Patients who had been prescribed lidocaine plasters for other indications were given a three month grace period.

I commend the bravery of Alison McCormack who took part in the programme and shared her story.<\/p>  <p>  People should feel safe in our hospitals and they should be sure that they are getting the right care and the best possible care.  They should be able to trust the advice of medical professionals and rest assured that the advice given is in their best interest.  People should also be confident that when a mistake has been made and medical professionals and hospitals or other health institutions become aware of it, they will be informed and that all will be done to rectify their situation.  That is what should naturally happen in a well-run health service.<\/p>  <p>  Compassion and honesty should be evident at all levels and even more so at the higher institutional levels of our hospitals.  This honesty and compassion was missing from the treatment of Alison McCormack and this is extremely worrying.  It was missing when Ms McCormack was first diagnosed with breast cancer at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in 2010 when the pathologist misdiagnosed the seriousness of the cancer in the original biopsy.  It was missing when the same pathologist then misdiagnosed the breast tissue that was examined following Ms McCormack's mastectomy.<\/p>  <p>  Two years later in October 2012, Ms McCormack discovered a lump in her neck and returned to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital for tests.  The original cancer had come back and had spread into the lymph nodes of her arm and up into her neck.  Ms McCormack began to ask questions as to why her cancer had returned and at her request a meeting with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital was arranged where she was informed for the first time that her cancer had been misdiagnosed.  I put it to the Taoiseach that this meeting was at Ms McCormack's request.  She had to ask for it.  Nobody came looking for her.<\/p>  <p>  This situation has been further compounded by the fact that the hospital had been aware of a misdiagnosis since February 2013 but Ms McCormack was not informed until November 2013, after she had requested a meeting with the hospital.  Nobody came to find her.  This woman lost nine long months.  Ms McCormack, as a cancer patient, had to go and look for the truth.  Had she not gone looking for that truth she never would have learned that the hospital and the pathologist who had examined her had made a huge mistake.  Why was Ms McCormack not immediately informed of the misdiagnosis when it was discovered in February 2013?<\/p>  <p>  The \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" reporter pointed out that a review of every tenth case, as well as a further nine cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS, which is a diagnosis similar to Ms McCormack's, revealed that another case had also been misdiagnosed.  This shows a 22% error rate for DCIS cases.  The hospital has refused to confirm to \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" if the second patient has been told that she was misdiagnosed.  We know that she is being treated but we do not know if\u00a0she has been told about the misdiagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody is saying that the health service can be run without human error but when a mistake is made there should be an apology and the relevant parties should be informed.  The patient is at a disadvantage when an error occurs.  Last night's programme showed a circling of the wagons.  We saw the system come up against one woman on her own.  Will the Taoiseach agree that there should be a legal duty of candour?  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the full case load of the pathologist who had a 22% misdiagnosis rate for DCIS cases will be reviewed?  Can the Taoiseach also confirm that the second woman who was misdiagnosed was informed by St. James&rsquo;s Hospital of her misdiagnosis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100013#L00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1519214700,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly.

I thank her for her bravery in coming forward and in making her case public so that lessons can be learned and mistakes not repeated.  I also wish her the very best in her recovery.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Reilly has acknowledged, it is a very sad truth that as long as we have a health service that is run by people with the help of machines there will be human error and there will be machine error.  This is the truth.  The important thing, however, is that where errors occur they are admitted, that hospitals and clinicians are honest about their errors and that they are identified and minimised.  In this case it appears that the patient in question was not informed that a misdiagnosis had occurred and this is wrong.  There is a duty of candour to inform patients if a mistake has occurred.  In order to reinforce this, just in the last few months the Oireachtas passed legislation to protect open disclosure.  I appreciate that this law was not in place at the time but it is now in place.  We now expect from our hospitals - from management and from clinicians - that they engage in the duty of candour and tell patients when mistakes have occurred.

He cynically used public money to enhance his appeal to Fine Gael members.  That campaign may now be largely forgotten but the agenda behind it remains.  It was more than just a dog whistle campaign for votes.  It was part of an ideological assault on social welfare.  Under the guise of labour activation measures pushed by Fine Gael and Labour, unemployed people have been demonised, victimised and have had their social welfare cut, all in the service of constructing a republic of precarity which drives people into the kind of low-paid precarious work which has become widespread.  One in four workers are now in part-time employment, 30% of workers are low-paid and 8% of workers have hours which change from week to week or from month to month.  The result is a completely lack of stability and security and people being unable to plan their lives.

They say that they are not given any real training and they are just supervised while looking for jobs on a computer, which means that it is pointless travel for many.  They describe it as demeaning, patronising and infantilising.  The threat of having their social welfare cut by more than &euro;40 hangs over all of their interactions with these private companies, which would leave people trying to survive on &euro;150 or less a week.<\/p>  <p>  Since JobPath was introduced, the number of people who have had these so-called penalty rates applied has increased from 5,000 in 2015 to 16,000 last year.  That is in one year alone.  Some 6,500 JobPath participants have had their dole cut.  On the other hand, &euro;84 million of public money has been paid to just two companies, SeeTec and Turas Nua.  They get money each time someone signs a personal progression plan and they get paid job sustainment fees.  Both SeeTec and Working Links, which is one of two companies behind Turas Nua, have been accused of fraud in the operation of similar schemes in Britain.  Last October in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Catherine Murphy raised a very serious case of fraud by SeeTec in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  All of that has been justified up until now on the false basis that the system works and gets people into employment.  That has now been completely exposed by the Government's own figures which came out three weeks ago.  Only 18% of those who engage in JobPath end up in full-time employment.  Some &euro;84 million has been given to these private companies to get people jobs which they would have got themselves.  Will the Taoiseach now read the writing on the wall for JobPath?  Will he agree that the scheme needs to be scrapped and that instead of handing money over to private companies, he should invest in proper education and training and in real jobs for unemployed people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100014#M00100","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1519215300,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Welfare fraud is very real.

Eventually, after much pressure, it was published in June 2017.  Recommendation No. 1 in that report was that a steering group be appointed to look at these issues.  In the recommendation that steering group was to be started in October 2016.  The Minister announced in January 2018 that he was establishing the steering group to the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, conference.

I am very grateful also to the Bills Office, which has worked with us on the legislation, and to our own researcher, Mr. Kevin Dillon.  The Bill is sponsored by Deputies Jack Chambers, Jim O'Callaghan and me.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to socially responsible gambling.  As such, the Bill has a double objective to regulate the expanding gambling sector which has emerged in recent years and to protect vulnerable adults and young people.  The legislation updates the general scheme of a Bill published by the Government in 2013 but never moved.  We need effective gambling regulation to provide those who work in the industry with certainty on socially responsible gambling.  We are committed to working with the industry to build a new framework but the time for delay has long since passed.  The regulation we outline in the Bill recognises that gambling remains an extremely weakly regulated sector.  I am looking here at legislation dating back to 1956.  The Bill seeks to establish an office of gambling control which new agency will be self-financing through the industry.  The flexible powers sought to be provided to the new agency are key elements of the Bill and will enable the State to move quickly with technological developments and ensure regulation does not lag behind.<\/p>  <p>  One of my first questions on promised legislation was on the status of the general scheme of the gambling control Bill of 2013.  According to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, the issue was the technological complexity of the industry.  Unfortunately, in the 18 months since the question was asked on the floor of the House, the Government has not moved forward with its legislation.  It is therefore incumbent on the Opposition to give this matter priority.  Many families and communities have been devastated by the effects of gambling.<\/p><p>It is an underlying issue, particularly when it comes to people's health.  In that context, I see that the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health is present.  It is having a huge effect on everybody.<\/p> <p> It is time to deal with this matter.  I ask the Government to support us in the context of progressing the Bill.  It should not leave us waiting for days or months on end, trying to get Private Members' time in order to bring the Bill to the House.  I hope the Government will work with us.

The current legislative framework on gambling is archaic, outdated and irrelevant.  It is underpinned by the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, which were introduced when there was no technology and barely any electricity.  What we are trying to do is establish an office of gambling control within the Department of Justice and Equality, a new, modernised licensing regime that would address the complexity of gambling and a regulatory framework in respect of advertising restrictions.  We want to break the link between sports and gambling.  We want monitoring and enforcement of existing rules and to expand those rules.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is that gambling addiction is reaching epidemic proportions.  Ireland has one of the worst statistics in Europe in terms of the level of gambling issues and addiction - we are third highest in the world in this regard - and this is against the backdrop of a legislative framework that is completely irrelevant and archaic.  In this attempt to modernise our laws and introduce a regulatory framework, there will be flexibility for Government amendments to be introduced to reflect the complexity of the issue.  We need to have a social gambling fund that reflects the turnover of the gambling industry so that it pays back in the context of people who have suffered the consequences of gambling, in particular those who are problem gamblers.<\/p>  <p>  We all need to look at the statistics from the Rutland Centre.  These show that there has been a threefold increase - up from 3% three years ago to 9% last year - in the number of people presenting with addictions relating to gambling.  It is important that we have the legislative and regulatory framework to address this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies O'Callaghan, Rabbitte and I will be trying to progress this legislation through Second Stage.  We hope that we have the support of the Government and we would like to see the Bill prioritised at the justice committee, of which I am a member.  The legislation introduced by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter was very proactive in nature.  Unfortunately, his successor did not prioritise it but we would like to see this introduced.  I believe it is in everyone's interests for gambling to be regulated in order that we can turn the tide in respect of many of the issues people face, including the effect on their health.  I hope we will receive the support of Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1519218300,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519218300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519218300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1519218300,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519218300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R00700","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519218300,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed)","time":1519218300,"counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","time":1519218300,"counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R00950"},{"type":"question","time":1519218300,"counter":333,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[6904\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if his Department's officials are involved in meetings to discuss sectoral plans or responses to Brexit.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1519218300,"counter":334,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[8337\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if his Department has engaged in meetings regarding sectoral plans in response to Brexit.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1519218300,"counter":335,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[8575\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of officials in his Department in preparing for Brexit; and the number and roles of those officials dedicated solely to Brexit planning.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519218300,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The international, EU and Northern Ireland division of my Department covers work on all international, EU and British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs within the Department, including issues relating to Brexit.  This division is headed by a Second Secretary General, who also acts as the Irish sherpa for EU business, including Brexit.  The total staffing resources of the division, which are kept under ongoing review, currently amount to 24.3 whole-time equivalent staff across a full range of policy areas.  The division also supports me in respect of Government consideration of Brexit issues, including the negotiation process, both on the issues that are of unique or particular concern to Ireland and, more generally, the work of Cabinet committee C, which deals with EU affairs and Brexit.  The division also supports me in my international role and in all of my international engagements, and provides advice and support to me in respect of Northern Ireland affairs, British-Irish relations and Brexit issues in that context.  Staff in other divisions of the Department, notably the economic division, also contribute to Brexit-related work as necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The overall co-ordination of the Government&rsquo;s preparedness for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU is led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who also has special responsibility for Brexit.  A wide range of co-ordination structures are in place and officials from my Department participate in many of these, as required.  The Government is continuing to plan and refine its analysis, building on the range of reports and analysis already produced by Departments, State agencies and the ERSI on the implications of Brexit at the macro level and also at the sectoral level.  This ongoing work reflects extensive stakeholder engagement across all sectors.  Of course, the exact impacts of Brexit on specific sectors will depend on the negotiations and the nature and scope of the final agreement on the new relationship that exists between the EU and the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Significant measures were announced in budget 2018 and these build on those introduced in budget 2017.  They include: &euro;300 million for a Brexit loan scheme for business; increased funding for Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation; a &euro;25 million Brexit response loan scheme for the agrifood sector; and additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50 million in total.  Increased funding has also been allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including the opening of six new diplomatic missions this year.  The budget also allocated an additional capital expenditure of &euro;4.3 billion over four years to allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects, particularly in transport, while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.  Other measures highlighted in the budget which will help to mitigate Brexit risks include the establishment of a rainy day fund and increased investment in higher education.  The public consultation on the rainy day fund is now under way.<\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of the challenge of Brexit, it is of course taken account of in all Government policy areas.  For example, Brexit is one of the priority themes in the 2018 Action Plan for Jobs, which will be published shortly and which will include actions to ensure we are Brexit-prepared at both national and enterprise level.  Project Ireland 2040, the Government&rsquo;s national planning framework and national development plan published last Friday, takes full account of the challenges presented by Brexit and will ensure that Ireland is best placed to ensure growth on a sustainable basis into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100019#R01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519218300,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Last week, he accepted that planning for a position where the United Kingdom is not in the Single Market and customs union is required.  Having previously said that there are more than enough impact studies, he also accepted that the most recent impact study, of which we have only seen a summary, shows evidence of serious sectoral impacts which must be planned for.  I am sure the Taoiseach will have noticed that the Dutch Government confirmed in recent days that it has identified the number of extra customs officials it will require, depending on different Brexit outcomes, and has begun hiring up to 900 new people on the assumption that the softest outcome will be a free trade agreement with the UK.  The Netherlands and other countries appear to have completed very detailed planning and are now moving on to implementation.  Even the British Government has got around to some concrete planning, although, so far, it has simply confirmed that it does not currently have the capacity to manage controls outside the customs union in particular and it is unlikely to have this capacity for some years.<\/p><p>While a lot of documents are being issued by the Government, there is nearly no new information about sectoral actions.  Will the Taoiseach tell us when he will publish the Government's action plan based on different scenarios?  Is it the Government's position that it accepts the estimates by the Copenhagen group and how regularly will this analysis be updated?  Now that we have even greater clarity about the huge impact on the agrifood sector, when will we see credible proposals for helping farmers and the food industry to adjust?  I would also point out that this is, of course, linked to the multi-annual funding framework which will be discussed at the summit on Friday.  <i>The Times<\/i>, Ireland edition, contains a report to the effect that the bullet-proof backstop will not now be in the actual withdrawal agreement but that it may be in an attached protocol.  The Taoiseach might clarify the position in this regard.<\/p><p>For some reason, we do not have statements on the summit that is to be held this week.  I hope the Taoiseach will respect the role of the Oireachtas before making commitments on behalf of Ireland regarding matters such as the European Parliament and the choosing of the Commission President.  It is a very bad precedent that the Taoiseach is willing to address the European Parliament on these matters but not his own Parliament.

I am not sure where or when it was suggested that it would, although I am sure some people will be relieved by this clarification.  There are, however, some hardline Brexiteers who seem to be living on a very different planet to the rest of us.  Kate Hoey, MP said yesterday that the Good Friday Agreement was unsustainable.  Last week, Owen Paterson, who Deputy Adams once described accurately as \"a complete tube\", said the Good Friday Agreement had outlived its use.  This comes from a former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  It is completely bonkers stuff.  These remarks to little to allay the real fears and concerns of people across this island, and in the North in particular, about the Tory Brexit agenda.  Not alone are we facing the negative impacts on our economy, our rights and on every aspect of society but now some of them also want to cast aside the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will be aware that Deputy McDonald and Michelle O'Neill are in London today, where they will make clear to the Prime Minister, Theresa May, that the attitudes being bandied about are ridiculous and unacceptable.  We know that the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions are what is best for all our people, our economy, public services and building reconciliation.  Given the collapse of last week's talks, our view is that the best way forward is to embrace the Good Friday Agreement and re-establish the Executive on the basis of equality and respect, as intended.  Sinn F&eacute;in has tried to do this over the last year.  We reached an agreement with the DUP last week but unfortunately the DUP walked away and ended the process.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to reflect the co-equal and co-guarantor status of the two Governments.  The two Governments must initiate this as a matter of urgency and move to implement outstanding commitments.  That includes the Irish language Act, the release of funds for legacy inquests and the progression of legacy mechanisms.  It also includes the safeguarding of rights for all citizens including the right for marriage equality.  <\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach initiate the intergovernmental conference to allow for these issues to be progressed in that forum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100020#S00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519218900,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach tell Members whether the legal text to codify the agreement he made in December, which he described as bullet-proof, is being prepared at present?

Today's Irish edition of <i>The Times <\/i>reports that a source in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed that rather than being in the main document, that is, the treaty or agreement that finally emerges, the backstop option will be contained in a protocol agreement to run alongside the main withdrawal deal under draft plans being considered by EU negotiators.  It says that it will have the same legal backing as the main agreement but it is likely to be considered a victory for the UK where the Government has tried to explain, badly, how it might deal with the Border.  The Border interests are likely to be contained in a protocol, annexe or addendum to the deal.

Ireland 2040, which was published on Friday following a Cabinet meeting in Sligo, includes &euro;116 billion of investment in infrastructure over the next ten years, including projects which will be important in the context of Brexit.

No matter who sits in this office or from which side of the House one looks at it, if there is a significant change in the trading relationship between Britain and Ireland, companies that depend on the UK market for exports will face difficulties.  We need to help them to prepare, which involves diversifying markets, increasing domestic markets and elsewhere.  We have seen some real success in the agrifood sector, for example, even though exports continue to rise to the UK, the percentage of exports is falling.  It has gone from about 45% to 35% in a very short period.  That is a good example of how Government is working with industry, particularly agrifood, in successfully diversifying markets.  When we have a better of idea of what Brexit will really mean and what it will look like in terms of the next trading relationship, we will be able to provide loans and perhaps even state aid to companies to allow them to change what they do in order that they can appeal to new markets.<\/p>  <p>  The Government accepts the Copenhagen Economics report.  I will offer one caveat, in that the ESRI produced a similar analysis some months ago that makes slightly different assumptions but broadly speaking, both analyses project similar outcomes.  I do not want to say that one is better than the other, but they use different assumptions, and taking them together I would give them equal weight.

At around the same time, the Taoiseach talked about making sure the public would see concrete outcomes on specific problems.  One striking aspect of what has happened since then is the emphasis has been on talking about process and promises without any concrete link to service targets.  Soon after Deputy Harris, for example, took over the Department of Health, he announced that the health strategy, launched by the former Minister, Senator Reilly, and being implemented by Deputy Harris' predecessor, the Taoiseach, was to be abandoned.  In its place is due to come an official response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Can the Taoiseach explain how the Government could determine the capital investment needs of the health sector before it has decided on the overall health policies?<\/p>  <p>  More importantly, can the Taoiseach tell us which specific service levels the Government is promising to achieve with the announced investments?  In the area of mental health, there has been a sustained failure to deliver on core service commitments.  We received absolute assurances from the Taoiseach's predecessor and from the Taoiseach that targets would be met but, unfortunately, they have not been met.  All we have heard is the usual hand-wringing from Government and that it is someone else's fault.  It is a serious issue in terms of the non-filling of posts across the mental health service.  Are there specific service level commitments which the Taoiseach is willing to stand over because I happen to know that the little due diligence that has been done on some of the physical infrastructure investments has been done in the context of an overall assessment of health needs in given areas, such as chronic illness and the growing ageing demographic.  There are very serious issues in terms of how these investments have been announced in the absence of that kind of service level assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100021#T00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519219500,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's response was brief.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Taoiseach avoided the question put to him in relation to the establishment of a Cabinet committee on Irish unity.  The Taoiseach rightly talked about his Government's and his personal commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.  Sinn F&eacute;in is equally committed to the Good Friday Agreement.  However, we also believe that we need to prepare for Irish unity.  I note the comments of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, during the Fine Gael leadership election where he stated in his policy document, \"We need to prepare for the possibility that a United Ireland or shared sovereignty will occur in our lifetime.\", and he is dead right.  That work should begin as soon as possible.  I ask the Taoiseach if he will examine the merit of establishing a dedicated Cabinet committee to discuss this issue in terms of how a new agreed Ireland would look and how we will plan for that.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to ask whether the issue of the money messages has presented itself at any of these Cabinet meetings.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, there are 27 pieces of legislation currently that have passed Second Stage in this House, some of them unanimously.  These are the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016, the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017, the Coroners Bill 2015, the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016, the Education (Amendment) Bill 2015, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2016, the Flood Insurance Bill 2016, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017, the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016, the Local Government (Establishment of Town Councils Commission) Bill 2017, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill 2017, the Multi-Party Actions Bill 2017, the National Famine Commemoration Day Bill 2017, the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017, the Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2017, the Prisons (Solitary Confinement) (Amendment) Bill 2016, the prohibition Bill, the Protection of Employees (Collective Redundancies) Bill 2017, the Public Services and Procurement (Social Value) Bill 2017, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund (Amendment) Bill 2016, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018, the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill 2017 and the Waste Reduction Bill 2017.  All of those were passed by this House, some of them unanimously.  One of those is a Bill that I myself brought forward.  To let the Taoiseach know what that Bill does, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017 ensures that insurance companies cannot wriggle out of paying a claim.  If a person's house, for example, was hit by lightning and burnt to the ground and the assessor found that the burglar alarm was faulty which would have nothing to do with the claim whatsoever, on that basis they can wriggle their way out of it.  Why is the Cabinet delaying and subverting the will of the D&aacute;il, which is that these pieces of legislation would proceed to Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100021#T00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1519219500,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I ask the Taoiseach specifically in relation to the Cabinet committee dealing with health and the Cabinet subcommittee dealing with children.  In relation to health, it is difficult to understand, in the context of both Sl&aacute;intecare which the Government has agreed to and the previous plans, what is happening.  For example, the 100-bed unit for older people which was promised to be built in Connolly Hospital has hardly progressed at all.  Given that it is in the Taoiseach's constituency and mine, could he tell us what is happening to such projects?  We know they are in the grand plan but by now they should be well progressed, and there is a significant demand for the services.  Moreover, I visited Connolly Hospital this morning and there is considerable concern among the staff, the patients and their relatives that some of the units dealing with older people are either to be closed or amalgamated.  This is entirely at odds with what was laid out in the plan that was put forward when I was in government and the Taoiseach was Minister for Health to have a 100-bed unit.  Instead of having more provision, it looks like there will be a closure.<\/p>  <p>  The second question I want to ask is about child care which is raised constantly with me by young families in areas such as Castleknock.  In many suburbs, towns and cities, cr&egrave;che providers are refusing to take part in the second year of the early childhood education and fees for those cr&egrave;ches are being raised.  As the young families concerned are also struggling to pay mortgages, in terms of the grandiose long-term plans, the issue is what in the meantime the Government will do in relation to the difficulties being experienced by parents with small children who would use cr&egrave;ches and want to use the first and second year of the early childhood education.  They are being left completely bereft of anyone whom they can go to.  Has the Government sat down to discuss this major issue for parents with young children right across Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100021#T00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519219500,"counter":380,"content":"<p>In relation to the assessment of capital needs in the health sector, that was very much covered by the capacity review that was commissioned by the Minister for Health.  The capacity review was in the programme for Government.  It is referenced specifically in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The capacity review was published in January.  It outlines the kind of increase in capacity that we need in terms of acute hospital beds, critical care, social care beds for the elderly and also what is likely to be required in terms of increases in staffing levels in primary care and other areas.  That capacity review very much informed the NDP and Project Ireland 2040.  In addition, of course, we already know what we need in terms of ICT investment in the health service because that was covered in the eHealth analysis which was published before that.<\/p>  <p>  It is fair to say that what is put in Project Ireland 2040 for health is very much evidence-based and very much based on those reports and reviews.  What we see in health is a commitment of almost &euro;11 billion over ten years, doubling the capital expenditure for health over ten years and allowing us to make those game-changing investments that are needed in areas such as information and communication technology which is really in deficit in the health service, the acute hospitals and primary care.<\/p>  <p>  Service level commitments are in the HSE service plan for 2018 but we do not have any long-term service level commitments.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin makes a valid point in that regard.  Perhaps that is something that we need to put into the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation report as to how we believe this ongoing increase in spending and ongoing investment in health infrastructure should result in outcomes for patients because that is what matters most.  When we talk about outcomes for patients, it should not only be about waiting lists and overcrowding, important as those issues are.  We need to talk about matters such as patient experience and survival rates for cancer which are important too.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the establishment of a Cabinet committee on Irish unity, that is not a good idea.  First, there is not a majority in Northern Ireland at present in favour of a united Ireland.<\/p><p>We are in the middle of very sensitive Brexit negotiations and may continue to be for a number of months, perhaps even more than a year.  We are trying to defend the Good Friday Agreement from some who are seeking to undermine it.  We are also trying to get the Assembly and the Executive up and running.  The establishment now of a Cabinet committee on Irish unity would be unhelpful in our efforts to defend the Good Friday Agreement in that we would be saying we are looking beyond it.  We are not.  The Good Friday Agreement is the best way forward for Northern Ireland.  I also think it would be provocative towards unionism.  While there may be occasions on which one may need to provoke people, I would not do it for the sake of setting up a Cabinet committee.  It would have to be something that would result in a real outcome for people.  This is why I do not favour a Cabinet committee on Irish unity.<\/p> <p> Regarding the Good Friday Agreement more generally, the Government is absolutely committed to the agreement.  It is an international agreement.  It is in part made up of the British-Irish Agreement, after all, between two sovereign states.  I have noted that some hardline Brexiteers, albeit not members of the British Government, have sought to undermine the Good Friday Agreement in recent weeks.  I further note that these are the same people who insist that we must respect the result of their referendum, which was approximately 52% to 48% in favour of Brexit, and we do respect that.  However, I remind them that we had a referendum as well on the Good Friday Agreement, for which 94% of people in this jurisdiction and 71% of people in Northern Ireland voted.  I therefore ask these people to respect our referendums and the sovereign and democratic will of people in Northern Ireland and Ireland with regard to the Good Friday Agreement.  I very much welcome the statement made by the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, in the House of Commons yesterday in which she boldly stated that the UK Government is steadfast behind the Good Friday Agreement, whatever some other people may say.<\/p> <p> I think there is a problem with money messages.  A huge amount of legislation of variable quality is coming through this House and no money has been voted by the Oireachtas to implement any of it.  We have a huge disparity between the quality of legislation that comes from Government and that which comes from the Opposition and the rules in this regard.  An Opposition Member, or a Private Member sitting on the Government benches, can produce a Bill on Thursday, publish it on Friday and have it debated in the D&aacute;il and passed through Second Stage the following week.  The Government cannot do that.  It must ordinarily produce heads, then draft the legislation in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, have the Bill go through pre-legislative scrutiny, publish the Bill and have it debated in this House.  That is the proper way to do things, and there should be equality of standards between what is produced as a Private Members' Bill and what is produced as a Government Bill.  We should not accept a lower standard of legislation from the Opposition or from Private Members than we expect from our Government.  A former Secretary General, Mr. Dunning, did a report in which he put forward very workable proposals as to how we can improve things in order that we have less legislation coming through but legislation of a quality that could become law.  I encourage those parties that have not yet accepted that report to do so.  We will then be able to make changes and get more Private Members' legislation through and I will be in a position to issue money messages.<\/p> <p> I will have to follow up on the 100-bed unit for older people in Connolly.  I am not sure what is the up-to-date picture.  My recollection is the same as Deputy Burton's, that is, that it was to be built and that the older units would not be closed until it was built, but I welcome the reminder about this important local issue and I will definitely follow up on it today.<\/p> <p> Deputy Martin mentioned earlier the issue of the selection of the President of the European Commission.

Its focus is to treat communications as a whole-of-Government activity and to speak to our citizens in a way that they understand and so they can be aware of the Government services available to them and the actions that Government is taking on their behalf.<\/p><p>The focus of the work of the SCU comprises three work streams: first, streamlining communications to the citizen, including the roll-out of a single unified Government of Ireland identity programme and the migration to the consolidated Government platform of <i>gov.ie<\/i>, which will produce financial savings in the medium term; second, running and supporting cross-Government priority information campaigns; and, third, implementing a capacity-building professional development programme for officials working in communications across the Civil Service.  Staff in the unit share responsibilities across these three work streams to deliver on the unit's work programme.<\/p><p>At present, there are 15 staff working in the unit: one director, who is paid at assistant secretary level, one principal officer, four assistant principal officers, two higher executive officers, three administrative officers, three communications and media assistants and one executive officer.  The former MerrionStreet, or Government information service, GIS, function has been integrated into this new structure.  The Government press office continues to operate as before in dealing with day-to-day media queries under the direction of the Government press secretary, Nick Miller.  The salaries of the staff in the SCU are met from my Department's administrative salary budget, which was reduced in 2018.<\/p><p>As I have already stated to the House, a research tender with an estimated cost of &euro;130,000, excluding VAT, was published on 18 September 2017 to commission an initial report of the Government and its services and a rolling tracker of attitudes towards it.  The tender was awarded to Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes and the final results are expected to be available in late spring.  These results will be published.<\/p><p>All media, both traditional and social, are utilised in the course of the delivery of campaigns by the unit.  The choice of media is informed by the nature, subject and reach of the campaign.  In some cases, media content partnerships with national and local media form part of campaigns in order to fully explain to citizens the various Government initiatives and actions and how they will impact their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100022#U01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1519220100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his answer.  He said \"all media\".  We heard yesterday that his Government is running advertising in cinemas, presumably directed largely at younger audiences.  Does this mean that some of the advertising will also go to TV and radio?  We need a clear answer on this because the concern, I think, of all Opposition Members is that the distinction between a party in government, or a governing party, and the Government is very clear in our Constitution.  We asked the Taoiseach about this yesterday.  He seems to be hell-bent on blurring the distinction between the two, and Fine Gael as a political party gets funding both in terms of the leader's allowance and the payments made to the party.  I said to him yesterday this is a fundamental issue for our democracy and our Constitution, and the fudging in the end will not do anyone any good.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's press releases are no longer published on his Department website.  Why is this?  He has told us he is very interested in direct communication through social media, which is fair enough, but I think there is also a requirement for the text of what the Taoiseach is saying to be available.  Will he also tell us about the outcome of the tender for the market research element of the contracts he advised us of last week and in earlier weeks?  When will he publish the results?  We are aware that Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes have apparently won the contract and we know about a number of other contracts that were won, including the one concerning the identity research to which his Government has committed and which he has not quite explained to us yet.<\/p><p>Is this just classification of segments into different age groups?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100022#U01700","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519220700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>We need to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100023#V00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519220700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>What is involved is incredibly similar to political deep-market background research, which includes the use of panels and survey groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100023#V00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1519220700,"counter":401,"content":"<p>If we do not conclude the questions we will not have time for the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100023#V00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519220700,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Yesterday's conversation on the marketing unit was helpful because it allowed time to fact-check some of the Government's statements.  Approximately &euro;340,000 was the amount spent on the launch of the 2007 plan.  I checked a parliamentary question tabled at the time by Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  This does not compare with the amount spent on Friday's launch, which was by far the most expensive and extensive ever by a Government.<\/p><p>In the context of the relationship with the media and the matter of the unit's political activity, the national development plan was formally adopted by the Government last Friday but sectoral groups were fully briefed on Thursday.  When it was announced, Fine Gael put up a new website with enormous detail of the plan, including exact wording and a county-by-county list of promises not published by the Government.  This can only have come from direct political engagement with the unit.  How does that fit with the Civil Service code?<\/p><p>On the media content partnership, the Taoiseach must accept that there is something ethically dubious at the very least about one arm of the his Department seeking coverage for so-called exclusives about the plan while another is discussing major advertising spending with the same media outlets.  The Taoiseach has said he wanted to get the media to run fewer negative stories.  If we look at pages 24 and 25 of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>- the position is the same in the <i>The Irish Times<\/i>- we can see articles marked as being in partnership with the Government.  They are presented as articles but should we take it that they are actually advertisements?  I have no issue with the Government advertising services in the media but these are political advertisements.  They are articles placing the Government in a good light in terms of these issues.  Every regional newspaper will have the biggest advertisement it has received in many years, block booked well in advance.  This is saturation of good news stories presented in that manner by the media.  There is an issue in terms of the health of our democracy and the ethical nature of the engagement of the Taoiseach and the Department in all of this.  The blurring of the lines is genuinely very worrying from the point of view of parliamentary democracy.  The Taoiseach will say that he is promoting the Government, but the dogs in the street know he is using taxpayers' money to promote Fine Gael politically.  That is the end of the story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100023#V00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1519220700,"counter":403,"content":"<p>There is a very fine line in all of this and it is clear that the Government has stepped over it.

The question that arises relates to whose initiative is this really.  These issues were dealt with at length yesterday and I do not want to rehash what was said.  In the context of the budget set aside for the advertisements on the national development plan, we know they are running across various media, including radio, print, online and in cinemas.  There is a valid debate to be had in respect of whether the advertisements are about making the Government look good - in my view, this is what they are - or whether they are about public information.  Ultimately, public money is being spent and clarity is required and would be welcomed.  How much money has been approved for these advertisements under the national development plan?

An interesting point about Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is that it does not acknowledge the existence of political parties, but that is an aside.  Certainly, any advertising or information campaign material will not mention any political parties, groups of Independents or particular Independents and it certainly will not involve any call to vote in a particular way.

Parents and children should have a right to access education that reflects their ethos and value system.  It is a healthy society that provides and embraces that level of diversity and that diversity is a threat to nobody.  At this stage in our development as a society, nobody opposes diversity and pluralism within the education system in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  However, the provision of multidenominational and non-denominational education in this State has happened at a snail's pace and this has caused massive difficulties for parents and children.  I attended a public meeting in Trim this week at which there was noticeable shock and anger among parents regarding what has happened to the plans for the development of their own school in Trim.  The Minister must admit that the process of providing multidenominational education has been cack-handed at best.<\/p>  <p>  Since becoming a Deputy, one thing I have noticed is that decisions are often made by one section of a Department but those decisions do not necessarily have the plans, support or resources to happen properly.  One often sees a decision made and something started but when it comes to implementation, the project quickly runs into significant problems.  In my view, this is what is happening with the five Educate Together schools that have had a Departmental half-stream limit imposed upon their next school year. <\/p>  <p>  Let us consider Trim, for example.  Trim is a growing commuter town in Meath.  It is well provided with Catholic, Protestant and community schools and the past four years have seen the addition of the Educate Together school.  That school is going from strength to strength, with great teachers and great education.  It has added to the diversity and the pluralism within the town and its extensive hinterland because it is the only school of its type for many miles around.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that all of the schools were in demand in Trim.  There has not been pressure on school numbers in the schools in Trim.  Because it is a growing town, it is expected that capacity will soon run out.  Yet when I asked a parliamentary question with regard to this, I learned that the decision was based on the view that there must be adherence to the balance of pupil numbers in other schools.  That is a major difficulty.  In fact, I believe that the source of this particular problem is a decision by the Department not to fund the necessary provisions for these five schools, especially the school in Trim. <\/p>  <p>  If one considers the current situation in Trim, the school is operating in a former golf club building.  It has a small sliver of grass for the kids to play on.  They also play in the car park of the school.  As demand is rising, the school has applied for two prefabs to be added.  However, when set up, those two prefabs will eat into the kids' play area significantly.  Despite all of this, demand is still rising and if the Minister does not implement his ban on bringing a full class into the school, those prefabs will be full. <\/p>  <p>  What went wrong here?  Why did the Department not follow through on its promise to provide proper facilities and resources for the school, and when will that happen? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100024#CC00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1519221300,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for raising this because it is an issue that needs some understanding.  The background to this issue is that in 2012, a group was formed to examine patronage.  It recommended that the demand for patronage diversity should be met in areas of stable population by divesting patronage of existing schools where there was evidence of parental demand for change.  This was a process of divesting patronage.  As a result, surveys took place in 43 areas of stable growth.  The demand was identified in 28 of those, including Trim.  Trim Educate Together national school, ETNS, was established as a four-classroom school.  This had its origins in a report on pilot surveys, which indicated that at least half a single-stream school, comprising four classrooms, was required to accommodate parental demand in the area.<\/p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became or was due to become available as a result of amalgamation or closure of an existing school.  That was the context in which this was to be done.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable to make school properties available, the Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.  In the case of Trim ETNS, a property is being made available under the redress scheme.  This will be refurbished to provide four classrooms and ancillary accommodation for the school. <\/p>  <p>  All schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.  The initial establishment of Trim ETNS as a four-classroom school, and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation, has been reflected in the Department's engagement with the patron body, which is Educate Together.  When the school raised the issue of expanding its enrolment, my Department invited Educate Together to submit a case for this to the Department.  A case has been submitted by Educate together to further expand Trim Educate Together national school and four other schools under the patronage of Educate Together which opened under the same patronage divestment process.  The four schools concerned are located in New Ross, Castlebar, Tuam and Tramore.  These proposals are currently under consideration. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also carrying out a nationwide demographic exercise at primary and post-primary levels to identify the areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed to plan for school provision nationwide.  This work is almost complete.  In this context, the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercise will provide input into consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's rightful concern that the divestment process has been proceeding very slowly, I note that I am instituting a new patronage reconfiguration process.  It is hoped this will accelerate the delivery of multidenominational and non-denominational schools to reach the target of 400 by 2030.  Unlike the previous process, this plan will focus on live transfers in order that a school which transfers under this process will not be reliant on temporary accommodation.  This new process aims to speed up matters.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n rightly noted that Trim is a growing area and obviously, the demographic assessment will have to determine whether that is creating a demand for additional space.  I reiterate we are evaluating the request by Educate Together. <\/p>  <p>  To put this in a broader context, where one school in an area is very popular and another is not so popular, we do not fund the expansion of the popular school when the less popular one has a lot of empty places.  That has been a general policy position.  It is where there is need for spaces that we make provision for a new school.  The Deputy will know that every single primary school that has been sanctioned in recent times has gone to a non-denominational patron.  That is the model within which this has been carried out.  We are hoping that the new patronage approach will speed this up because, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n says, there is an expressed willingness on all sides to see the transfer of patronage.  Making that happen is the challenge. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100024#CC00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1519221300,"counter":444,"content":"<p>There is some confusion here.  Obviously the decision was made to create diversity in the town of Trim with the addition of another option for parents and children.  Some level of demographic research must have informed that decision.  The Minister mentions the idea of demographic research as though it is a new thing.  He speaks as though it struck the Department in the last few weeks that it must be done.  Demographic research is carried out within the Department on an ongoing basis.  For the Government to decide to set up a school on the basis of no demographic research is a nonsense.  Of course the school was set up on the basis of demographic projections into the future.<\/p>  <p>  There is a further difficulty here because in all the conversations the school, the board of management, the principals and Educate Together have had with the Department, it was never discussed that there would be a half-stream limit on the school or that there would not be a normal stream within the school.<\/p><p>The Minister said that the school is applying for additional enrolment but it is not.  The school is looking to enrol a new stream every year.  There is no change in its approach.<\/p> <p> Let us call a spade a spade.  This half-assed decision to force a half stream cap on the school is based on funding decisions made within the Department.  The Minister is correct that a school building was divested on Patrick Street, Trim, to be made available for Educate Together, but, as late as last year, the Department was saying plans were ready to kick in for the refurbishment of that building to make it accessible to the school.  If the school is set up and the resources for it to function are provided, that cannot be that difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100024#CC00400","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519221900,"counter":446,"content":"<p>The school was identified in an area where there was not demographic pressure.  These specific areas did not face demographic pressure and the idea was to divest an existing school through an amalgamation, with a transfer to a new patron.  That was the context in which this project was developed; it was not included in the expanding areas, in which case all new schools are entirely non-denominational.  Thirty have gone non-denominational in the past few years.  This project was being done in the context of the divesting of an existing school to facilitate a new patron.  The current school was established as a four-classroom building.  St. Mary's does not have enough accommodation for an eight-classroom building.  The refurbishment is being done in the context of a four-classroom building, which would not meet the needs of an eight-classroom school.  However, I understand that what has happened is that there is more demand to enrol in the school than would be met by a four-classroom building.  The demand for additional places will have to be assessed by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  We will examine the demographics to establish where there is now a demographic pressure that was not there at the time the project was approved.  We will also examine the case being made by Educate Together.  This is not a case of someone trying to pull the rug from under someone else.  The project was developed in a particular context and the weakness of that process is evident.  It required closures and amalgamations to trigger it and it has not produced a flow.  We are now trying a different approach involving the live transfer of a school in total to a new patron, which does not require divestiture, closure or sale or acquisition of property.

St. Joseph's primary school in Kilcock dates from the 1950s.  It was the first new national school in the town for some time.  When the school was built, the population was 1,000 but it is now almost 6,500.  However, the school buildings are unchanged from that time.  I would like to give credit to the many parents who have contacted me in recent weeks.  They are alarmed, concerned and confused about what will happen next with the school project.  I acknowledge the presence of Councillor Paul Ward in the Gallery.  He represents Kilcock and he has been involved in the campaign for the new school.  I also give credit to the principal, Ms Ann McQuillan, her staff and management team who have made Trojan efforts over the past ten years to manage within the existing school structure, which is antiquated, outdated and undersized relative to the school population.<\/p>  <p>  The school comprises four permanent classrooms in one building and nine prefabs, which equates almost to a 2:1 ratio of prefabs to permanent buildings.  That makes the case strongly for a new building.  The request was initially approved in 2007 by the Department and, in 2012, the then Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, announced that the project would proceed and that construction would commence in 2014 or 2015.  Planning permission was granted in 2015 on that basis but there were delays, leading to stage 2b approval finally issuing last year.  The next logical step is to proceed to tender and then to construction with a view to the new school building finally opening.<\/p>  <p>  The campaign dates back to 2007.  More than ten years of effort has been put in by the school community and the town to get to this point, including significant local fundraising for ancillary supports to keep the school going in its current state in the meantime.  They were, therefore, alarmed and concerned when they were told in correspondence prior to Christmas that there was no guarantee that the school would be included in the capital programme for 2018-19, which has thrown a spanner in the works.  There is dismay, concern and confusion regarding the implications of this.  The project has been agreed since 2007, and allegedly fast-tracked since 2012, but as it proceeds through the various stages, it suddenly has a question mark over it for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  Nine out of 13 classrooms are located in prefabs.  The population of Kilcock is expanding rapidly.  There are multiple developments under way along the Meath-Kildare border on the approaches from both Maynooth and County Meath.  The current and future educational needs are evident.<\/p>  <p>  Not only that, the school has managed, in spite of all the challenges to accommodate two autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes, on which it should be commended, but they are also based in prefabs.  The Department guidelines provide for sensory rooms and gardens, break-out rooms and general purpose play areas which are best practice for such units.  The school has been unable to provide them but I commend Ms Ann McQuillan and the management team on providing ASD education anyway.  The school has made its best effort.  It was built for 150 pupils but it now has 355.  All the efforts of the school, community and management team must be met by the Department.  Will the Minister clarify the next steps in this process?  Will he confirm whether the school is included in the capital programme for 2018-19?  Will he confirm whether the tender is due to issue?

I can well understand the frustration of parents waiting for a school.  That demonstrates the wider context in which the previous discussion took place.  There is huge pressure on capital budgets to meet expanding needs when we are in the fortunate position of having increasing numbers of children entering our school.  The major building project for St. Joseph's national school is at an advanced stage of architectural planning: stage 2b - detailed design.  This includes securing the statutory approvals, as the Deputy said, such as planning permission, fire certificate and disability access certificate, and the preparation of tender documents.  These have all been completed and the design team has submitted written confirmation that it is satisfied that the tender documents are complete, correct and in compliance with the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and the Department's tender documentation requirements.<\/p>  <p>  This project is included in the six-year programme announced in 2015 to go to tender and construction.

On 21 February 1988, 30 years ago today, Aidan McAnespie, a young nationalist and Gaelic football player, was shot dead as he made his way to his local Gaelic football club grounds at Aghaloo, Aughnacloy, County Tyrone.  He had just passed through the British army checkpoint on foot when a single bullet, fired by a British soldier in the watchtower structure above and behind him, robbed him of his young life and robbed his family of a dearly loved son and brother.  The McAnespie family grieve to this day.<\/p>  <p>  This was no accidental discharge, a view since expressed on behalf of even the PSNI.  Aidan McAnespie was told repeatedly as he passed through that checkpoint, going to and from his work in Monaghan, that he would be shot.  He feared for his life and, as time would confirm, with good reason.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of Aidan's murder I was a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor for north Monaghan.  During the previous year, 1987, Aidan McAnespie came to our party office in Monaghan and recounted to me the details of the threats to which he was being subjected.  I sought to assist him but the avenues open to me were limited due to section 31 censorship and the refusal of Government Ministers, the predecessors of the current Minister, to meet or engage with Sinn F&eacute;in elected representatives.  I sought and secured a meeting with Cardinal Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Fiaich at his residence in Armagh and he took up Aidan's case and lobbied extensively on his behalf.  The cardinal later officiated at Aidan's funeral mass and once again affirmed his personal belief in, and solidarity with, this young innocent member of the wider nationalist and Catholic community north of the Border.  Today, only the most bigoted of anti-nationalists and anti-Catholics would deny the truth of Aidan McAnespie's murder.<\/p>  <p>  I and countless others have lobbied throughout the intervening years for the Government to release the Crowley report into the murder of Aidan McAnespie, principally to the McAnespie family.  The Crowley investigation was established by the Government here in Dublin.  Deputy Garda Commissioner Eugene Crowley anchored the process and, over a period of time, met with witnesses to Aidan's death and others who had relevant information regarding Aidan's experiences at the Aughnacloy British army checkpoint.<\/p>  <p>  I was one of those who presented before the deputy commissioner at that time.  While I have no personal recall of any reference to anonymity or confidentiality when I attended the Crowley investigation, I can accept that it could have come up in the case of other witnesses.  Those were very different times.  They were clearly dark and dangerous times and, following the murder of Aidan McAnespie, a whole community that straddled the Border was deeply affected.  Some, especially those who travelled through the Aughnacloy checkpoint daily or regularly, were fearful for their safety.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest that, 30 years later, we are in a very different time and place, that those fears no longer exist and that there is certainly no justification for them.  Accordingly, I ask the Minister to proactively establish the number of witnesses who presented to the deputy commissioner or who forwarded written evidence, and if he will establish the number to whom some form of a confidentiality understanding applied.  I ask him to undertake to contact each of them to establish if, 30 years later and in very different times, they are now willing to allow the release of their evidence as part of the overall Crowley report and to allow it to be given to the McAnespie family in line with its wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100026#EE00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1519222500,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for raising this matter on this poignant day, the 30th anniversary of the killing of Aidan McAnespie.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in recalls being a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor at the time.  I was a Member of this House on that day and what happened was a devastating tragedy for Aidan McAnespie, his family and the entire community in Aughnacloy and beyond, even into Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's own county of Monaghan.  His death was needless and I am very conscious of the continued suffering of his family.<\/p>  <p>  Given the widespread public disquiet at the death of Aidan McAnespie, the Government requested that an inquiry be carried out into the shooting and surrounding circumstances.  The then Deputy Garda Commissioner, Eugene Crowley, was appointed to conduct this inquiry.  However, because of fears that many people in the local community expressed to him as to their safety and security, they co-operated only and explicitly on the basis of an assurance of absolute confidentiality and that what they related to Deputy Commissioner Crowley was for the Government only.<\/p>  <p>  This report was submitted to the Minister for Justice in April 1988.  To seek to release the full content of the Crowley report, even at this stage 30 years later, would be a breach of trust of the Irish Government to those parties.  In 2002, the Government approved an outline summary of the Crowley report&rsquo;s conclusions and it was provided to the McAnespie family.  At that time, detailed consideration was given to producing an edited or redacted version of the report that would be meaningful, would not compromise confidentiality and could be provided to the family.  However, given the nature of the report, it did not prove possible to do so.  I have recently arranged for further copies of the limited summary and the post mortem examination report prepared by Professor John Harbison to be provided to the McAnespie family through their legal representatives.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will appreciate that the Government must have full regard to the expectations of the many people who contributed in good faith to the Crowley inquiry on the basis of a specific guarantee of absolute confidentiality and to the persisting obligation in that regard.  Regrettably, under these circumstances it is not considered possible to publish or further disseminate the report in its entirety.  It is a source of regret to me that this will inevitably be a disappointment to Aidan McAnespie&rsquo;s family, who suffer from his tragic loss to this very day.  However, the Irish Government is fully committed to the consensus that has been achieved in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement on the framework of institutions to assist families access information about the deaths of their loved ones as a result of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  The full implementation of that agreement has been hampered by the lack of a resolution on re-establishing the Executive in Northern Ireland.  I have listened to what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said regarding the witnesses and I will reflect on what options might be viable to further assist the McAnespie family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100026#EE00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1519222500,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply but, like the McAnespie family, I am disappointed.

As I have already indicated, I was one of those witnesses.  I was familiar with the story of Aidan McAnespie up to the time of his death - the continual harassment, the threats he was subjected to and the real fear he had which he recounted to me and to many others.  I do not recall Deputy Garda Commissioner Eugene Crowley extending the offer of confidentiality or any other form of words in the context of confidentiality in my case, nor would I have sought this.  Will the Minister please heed the appeal in my earlier contribution and establish the number of witnesses that actually presented? Will the Minister establish the number of those for whom that confidentiality arrangement applied?  I suggest it is a smaller number than many might expect.  I do not, however, take away from the fact that it was important for those to whom it did apply.  I do not take this away at all because I realised then and understood, and I still do, the real fear that was within my community at the time, especially in relation to that checkpoint and its regular use by some.  In all sincerity I say to the Minister that it is worth undertaking a proactive engagement with the list of those to whom that arrangement applied.  I warrant that in these very changed times of 30 years later that the greater number, if not all of those, would withdraw their understanding and allow for the report to be published and presented to the family, helping bring about closure for the McAnespie family and their terrible, tragic story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100026#EE00600","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519223100,"counter":458,"content":"<p>On this, the 30th anniversary of the tragedy, I offer my condolences and those of my Government colleagues to the McAnespie family and in particular to Aidan McAnespie's elderly father.

The Deputy will recall that the Government, the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland worked together over an extended period in 2014 to establish the Stormont House Agreement.  I was personally involved in that process as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the time.  Among other elements that agreement sets out a series of measures to put in place a structured framework to deal with Troubles related deaths, where there are unresolved issues, and to seek to provide more information to victims and to victims' families where that is possible.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the House that the Government remains fully committed to playing its part in implementing those measures and that work is ongoing to seek to achieve that.  The re-establishment of the institutional framework provided for under the Good Friday Agreement remains central to these efforts.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy John Halligan, for coming in to take this Topical Issue, which concerns the closure of Waltons music shop in Dublin city centre and the moving of its business to its Blanchardstown branch, having first opened its doors on North Frederick Street in 1922.  It is many a block of rosin, a bow or a string I bought there in my time.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to move was due to \"ever rising costs of doing business in the city centre\".  This has been extensively covered in the media recently.  I believe that physical, bricks and mortar retail shops are paying a disproportionate share of the overall basket of levies or costs placed on a physical business such as the commercial rates and VAT when these costs are compared to those of the online competitors.  While some may be subject to rates for a warehouse the online competitor does not have to pay high street rates.  In the case of a company based outside Ireland, for example, those rates would never hit Ireland's coffers.<\/p>  <p>  We are not dealing with a level playing field.  The burden is unfairly distributed on to the high street shop.  The concept of rates sprang from a time long before online business existed and before online sales were even conceived.  Rates are based on the principle that all retail transactions happen in a face-to-face environment.  Obviously the traditional retailers need to embrace the changing environment but this legacy issue, this money that is going off their bottom line, puts them constantly on the back foot because their online competitors are starting off from a higher financial base.  The high street businesses and those in the local villages are automatically at a disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  People's choices should not be inhibited.  There is no doubt that many people will continue to shop online as they are entitled to do, and I hope that they do, but the choice of the retailer comes into question in this regard.  Surely the choices are being made for retailers when there is a competitive disadvantage for the physical shop.<\/p>  <p>  We must also consider the huge social and interpersonal value in having shops in a community.  Members talk at length in the House about the value of pubs and post offices to the community.  There is a dividend also for the community in supporting our retailers.  Notwithstanding this there is also the importance of local employment.  This matter is not about subventing the retail sector: it is about trying to help retail in this environment.  I am not speaking of large companies: I am referring to the shops such as Waltons and the family businesses that have been in existence for some time.  We can see the huge body of evidence from recent years that these businesses are not able to be sustained.<\/p>  <p>  It is also very important to have a good mix of retailers on our streets.  Anybody who has walked up Grafton Street recently can see the proliferation of large international companies coming in who are able to pay these rates.  What has the Minister of State done and what is he doing to address these challenges to mitigate the loss of important contributors such as these retail outlets to the fabric of our towns and cities? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100027#FF00800","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1519223100,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connell for raising this very important matter.  I too was disappointed to hear of the difficulties experienced by the iconic Waltons music shop.  It is very famous for its musical instruments, but particularly famous for sheet music.  Musicians would come from all over the country to buy there.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that retail is hugely important in the fabric of towns and communities the length and breadth of Ireland.  Almost one in seven people in employment in Ireland is working in the retail sector and the vast majority of these are in small businesses.<\/p><p>The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, as the chair of my Department&rsquo;s retail consultation forum, is engaging with retailers and retail representative bodies on the current key issues facing the sector, of which there are many.  Through the forum, we are working on initiatives to both support retailers to build online capability and to enhance their cost competitiveness, and also to address the need for renewal of our town and village centres.<\/p> <p> In 2017, the forum&rsquo;s retail and town centre renewal working group published \"A Framework for Town Centre Renewal\", a reference document for stakeholder groups that sets out the key characteristics of a successful town centre and which identifies existing supports and best practice examples from around the country.  It includes an action plan for town centre renewal which is intended to be a blueprint for towns and villages and to guide them through the three stages of town centre renewal: stakeholder engagement, carrying out a town centre health check, and preparing a town centre plan.  Initiatives such as this are providing local groups with practical tools to make their town and village centres better places in which to work, shop and live.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that the retail sector is currently undergoing a period of change as traditional modes of trading are accompanied by significant growth in online retailing, as we are all aware.  The habits of consumers are changing and online retailing is rapidly becoming the norm.  This rapid digital transformation of the retail sector and the competition from sophisticated international business models is a challenge to the domestic retail sector that needs to be turned into an opportunity.  The internationalisation of retail means that Irish shops can now compete for business in a global market.  Our support to the sector includes a focus on building digital capability within businesses in order to develop a competitive online offer to win back domestic sales and compete in the global marketplace.<\/p> <p> The Deputy may be aware of the trading online voucher scheme, delivered by the local enterprise offices, LEOs, which was introduced in 2015 to provide training and matching funding to microbusinesses seeking to trade online.  It is a very good scheme.  It is a voucher scheme for businesses which have no more than ten employees, have less than &euro;2 million in turnover, have been trading for at least two years, and are located within a local enterprise office's area.  It is a pretty good scheme which appears to be working well.  More than 1,200 vouchers were approved in 2015, some 1,140 in 2016, and a similar amount in 2017.  Results from businesses in receipt of the voucher show that their sales increased by 20%, which is a dramatic increase.<\/p> <p> To build on this, my Department is exploring the development of a pilot programme for the retail sector to support small and medium-sized retailers to scale up their domestic and international online trading activity.  Through the retail consultation forum, a working group on skills for the retail sector is also looking at initiatives to assist with building digital skills capability in retail businesses.  However, I also note that Walton&rsquo;s music shop, which the Deputy referenced in her question, already has an online presence.  In this regard, as a Government we must be mindful of the other issues, besides competition from online retailers, that are leading to businesses closing their high street premises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100027#FF00900","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519223700,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  He said that the trading online voucher scheme which is being run through the local enterprise offices is a very good scheme.  Having talked to people on the ground about it, my understanding of the way the matched funding works is that the business comes up with &euro;2,500 and the LEO gives them another &euro;2,500.  However, speaking practically, a business has to have &euro;2,500 to begin with.  There is also a lot more to online business than just the website, and I am not kidding about that.  The maintenance of it is also an issue.  If one multiplies 3,480 by &euro;2,500, one is left with a large sum.  Has anyone done an assessment of whether the scheme is working?  It is my understanding, from talking to small businesses that fall into this category that people are paying the &euro;2,500, going on the course and getting a website, but they are then left hanging in the sense that they do not know what to do next.  Although I totally get that retail businesses must adapt or die, I am not sure that we are getting bang for our buck in respect of this investment.  Are we looking at the outcomes of this investment or do we just have many small businesses which have online presences but which are not actually trading online?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100028#GG00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1519223700,"counter":468,"content":"<p>To refer back to the voucher scheme, it does offer financial assistance of approximately &euro;2,500.

There are experts available to give advice to businesses.  All I can say to the Deputy in respect of the voucher scheme is that it seems to be working pretty well and that the numbers involved have been increasing year on year.  An assessment was carried out in respect of businesses which have participated in the scheme.  As I told the Deputy, this assessment showed that their sales increased by 20%.  I know that there is a lot more we can do, and we are attempting to do more.  The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, selected Roscommon for a series of regional workshops on online trading for business owners.  It is planned to take place in the next 12 months and will work its way around the country.  It will be working with the local enterprise office in Roscommon.<\/p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concern about the impact of online retailing and other emerging factors on the high street, but we need to remember that, first of all, buyers and consumers look for easy access, product availability and value for money.  This is all to do with competition.  It is very difficult for us as a Government to take one side or another in a competitive section of the economy.  I admit and accept that, as I said in my opening remarks, one in every seven people in employment in Ireland is working in the retail sector, the vast majority of these in small businesses.  There is no question that we have to do what we can as a Government to help and support small businesses.  We have introduced the Brexit loan scheme, we have retained the 9% hospitality VAT rate and we continue to reform the income tax system to put more money into people's pockets.  There are efforts being made.  All I can tell the Deputy on the voucher scheme is that it is working exceptionally well.  Many businesses have taken it up but I accept that there is a lot more to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100028#GG00300","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Project Ireland 2040: Statements (Resumed)","time":1519223700,"counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100028#GG00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1519223700,"counter":470,"content":"<p>We all welcome the concept of a development plan, looking to the future and planning for the future, and we know it has to happen.  As a Government, a society and a people we need to look to the future and to try to plan ahead in order to know where we are going and what we are at now.  The difficulty that many of us have spelled out with regard to this plan is that the draft which we saw in the beginning had many holes in it and many problems.  A number of Deputies, particularly Opposition Deputies, came together, pointed to that and caused a bit of a row to ensure that something would happen in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the launch in Sligo last Friday.  While the Taoiseach spoke and complained about Opposition Deputies trying to cause division,  I looked behind him and saw the Ministers, Deputy Michael Ring and Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, as well as other Deputies sitting there.  There was certainly little or nothing in the draft plan for their constituencies.  I expect they were as vocal behind the scenes as we were out front as to what needed to be done to change this plan and to put something in place that would really deliver for rural areas.  In fairness, the draft plan was not delivering for rural areas and the division the Taoiseach spoke about existed because of the absolute absence of measures to look after the midlands and the west.  The big problem I have with many of these things is that long-term planning has a problem.  There was also the big problem which I have with many of these things.<\/p><p>The problem with long-term planning is that when people look to something way into the future, it is a distraction from the immediate crisis.  We are all conscious that we have an immediate crisis, particularly in housing and our health care services.  We have an immediate crisis of rural depopulation in many parts of the country.  Those crises need to be dealt with now.  The real test of this plan will not be what it will do over 20 years but what it will do in the next three years.  It is in the next three years that we need to see the money being put up to ensure that we deliver.  Now is the time.  Timing is everything in these situations.  It is quite clear that unless something happens quickly, particularly in respect of the housing crisis, rural depopulation and transport services in the city of Dublin and many other places, we will have ongoing crises.  Much of the criticism of the plan has been that the money that is proposed to be delivered is spread out over a lengthy time.  Unless there is a lot of front-loading, we will not see the benefit of it.<\/p> <p> Money that is spent will leverage more money.  It will bring more private money out onto the field and get people working and things moving again.  I particularly think of rural Ireland, being a Deputy representing Sligo-Leitrim, west Cavan, south Donegal and north Roscommon.  We have a notorious problem with rural depopulation.  Our small schools are closing down or are losing teachers because we do not have any children any more.  Part of that problem is that people cannot build houses in rural Ireland.  I know one-off rural housing is an issue in many places where there is an over-proliferation of it but, certainly where I come from, the problem is that we do not have any.  That is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  I know the Minister of State is aware of that and of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, guidelines.  Something has to be done about the problem of meeting the confines of the Water Framework Directive.  However, the EPA went too far and caused a crisis in the other direction.  The lesson is that absolute rules do not work and we need to find a solution that is not as absolute as this one.<\/p> <p> The issue was brought up at the launch of the &euro;1 billion that is to be spent in rural towns over the next years.  That is a good policy if it can happen.  The scheme that is in place at present to help regenerate rural areas and small towns provides a loan of up to &euro;40,000 to renovate a property to house a person on the local authority list.  It has not worked.  There is no take-up on it and it is not going to work.  Something more substantive needs to be put in place.  If we took ten small towns in County Leitrim, for example, and were &euro;1 million to be spent in each of those towns, it would generate a lot of work.  It would give a lot of people renewed hope that something was going to happen and it would provide housing in those towns.  If we gave a 70% grant, we would get most of it back in the taxes that would be generated because when people get a grant to do something, they spend more money than what the grant provides.  On the law of averages with tax, excise duty, income taxes, VAT and all those things, we would get most of that money back. There is also the multiplier effect because when activity is happening, it creates opportunity and more activity.  That is the road the Government needs to go down as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> We need big projects to happen, such as the western rail corridor from Sligo, where we were on Friday, down through Galway and Limerick, through Tipperary and into the Port of Waterford.  With Brexit looming, it would be a means of getting freight off the road and getting a port that can send goods straight across to the European mainland.  This is an opportunity to do that.  Under the European funding for low-carbon transport initiatives, under the TEN-T programme, the Government could get up to 75% funding if it made it an electric railway.  That opportunity has been missed but may come up again in the next couple of years to be applied for and secured.  It would make a great difference to that whole region.<\/p> <p> There is a lot of stuff missing in this plan.  Really the problem is the absence of imagination.  Just repackaging old stuff, putting it out and calling it a plan is not good enough any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100028#GG00500","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519224300,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Kelly and Sherlock.

In the introductory part on page 17, in a chapter headed &quot;learning from the past&quot;, there is a reference to the 2002 national planning strategy as not having been a statutory plan with legislative backing.  The text then refers to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 as providing a legislative basis for the new national planning framework.  The problem is that this Bill has not yet become law.  In section 20C(1) of the Bill, under the heading &quot;Matters to be addressed in National Planning Framework&quot;, it states:<\/p><blockquote>Any document, published after the commencement of this Chapter, that amends or replaces the National Spatial Strategy or thereafter revises or replaces the National Planning Framework shall address the matters set out in subsection (2).<\/blockquote><p>Section 20C(2) goes on to list the various matters that are to be addressed under the national planning framework.

The Labour Party favours public investment in projects that benefit the public and we also favour good strategic planning.  However, we do not believe the plan is radical enough in addressing inequality, protecting our environment, developing sustainable transport, achieving regional balance or in a number of other areas.  I want to talk particularly about regional balance and housing.<\/p><p>If the plan is implemented, I have no doubt that by 2040, the country will still be in the unhealthy state it is in, with an even more sprawling greater Dublin area.  I say this after looking at the spending plans rather than buying the grand aspirations that are expressed, and there are lots of grand aspirations.  I say it also in the context of the growth figures in the plan for Dublin, the other cities and towns and smaller urban centres in rural areas.  I particularly want to speak about cities; my colleagues will speak further on other areas and matters.<\/p><p>Although the draft plan clearly stated that the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford would be the major growth centres, there are limits set on their growth.  I know last night the Minister said there were not caps but, effectively, they are caps.  A submission was made by my region to the draft plan.  It was agreed by the three local authorities, the chambers of commerce and a number of other bodies including Shannon Airport Authority.  Shannon Airport gets scarcely a mention although there is funding for various other airports that are not nearly as strategic.  The airport and the other bodies put forward a proposal after the draft plan came out.  It was supported by me and by many other public representatives and it expressed greater ambition for Limerick but it is not reflected in the final document.  Limerick is more ambitious for itself than the Government is for Limerick.<\/p><p>Others have confidence in us, too.

He suggested that if we want growth in these places, the investment has to go into them and not between them.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It should not be one or the other.  We need the M20.  The linking of Galway, Limerick and Cork by a decent road network is essential if we are not to have all roads leading to Dublin, which is currently the case.  It is needed to create the Atlantic corridor to counterbalance the eastern corridor and should go on to Waterford, which it does not.  At a maximum cost of &euro;900 million, it hardly matches the &euro;3 billion for the metro link, &euro;2 billion for the DART expansion, over &euro;1 billion to bring water from the mid-west to the east and many other projects such as the second runway at Dublin Airport, etc.  There should be investment in public transport in Dublin but the level of investment in other cities does not compare with what has been allocated to the capital.  It is not acceptable to say that we can have a road but we cannot have investment in the city.  It seems that the evidence-based comprehensive submission with strong support from stakeholders in the mid west found no favour in the final document and I wonder if it was pushed aside by the last-minute scramble to keep all members of the Cabinet happy and to ease the anxiety of Fine Gael backbenchers.<\/p> <p> My colleagues will address several other aspects of the plan.  I wish to briefly refer to a couple of things the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said, particularly in respect of the new rural development, urban development, climate change and disruptive technologies regeneration funds.  It appears that these will be highly competitive and that there will have to be matching funding.  The urban regeneration plan discusses matching investment from the private sector, euro for euro.  I am concerned that this will be a competitive, market-led process rather than addressing the regeneration needs of our urban centres and I wish to raise that with the Minister.<\/p> <p> I could say far more about the plans for housing but my concern in that regard is the meeting of targets, particularly as many of the targets outlined in Rebuilding Ireland have not been met.

I do not plan to take that much time.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the funding of approximately &euro;900 million for the M20 Cork to Limerick route.  All affected, including the chambers of commerce in Cork and Limerick, which did much work on this issue in terms of making submissions, various community groups, businesses and individuals who travel the route every day for work and other purposes are very welcoming of there finally being a financial commitment to the project.  I travelled from my home town of Mallow to Galway yesterday and then on to Dublin.  It is quite difficult to travel between Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville and there are serious traffic constraints.  Once one reaches Limerick, however, it is a joy to travel on to Galway, while, similarly, if one is travelling east towards Dublin, it is a seamless journey for anyone partaking of it.  When selecting the route for the M20 between Cork and Limerick, I ask that the Government take account of the serious blockages at Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville.  Those towns deserve to be freed of such congestion and running the route somewhere adjacent to them would be the most advisable and sensible option.<\/p>  <p>  The town of Cobh, known locally as the great island of Cobh, which has only one access route, is not mentioned in the plan.  There was some discussion late last year in this Chamber about the need to ensure that Cobh is serviced by proper infrastructure.  It is disappointing that there is no mention of the town in the significant list of inter-urban routes, which includes towns and cities such as Gorey, Cork and Limerick.  The people of Cobh deserve an adequate access point to their town.  Storm Ophelia demonstrated the need for such a route.  I hope that, in the context of the iterative process under way in regard to the national development plan, the Minister of State, Deputy English, who is present, could mention that need because it is inadvisable for Cobh to be left out of the plan, given that it has an approximate population of 13,000 and that in the event of a natural phenomenon such as Storm Ophelia, there is no guarantee of proper access for emergency vehicles to the town, which does not have secondary or tertiary medical facilities and is all but closed off from time to time.  I ask that consideration be given to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  There must be absolute transparency in terms of the process currently under way in respect of the Cork events centre.  This has been the subject of much debate in the context of requests for further funding in circumstances where taxpayers' money is involved and it appears that the representatives for the county and city of Cork have been left out of the loop regarding information flows on what is happening on the project.  A request for additional funding was made but the people of Cork demand to know its purpose.  People were foursquare behind the project when it was announced by the previous Government but somewhere along the way the goalposts were shifted, a request for additional funding came in and nobody is any the wiser as to how that money will be spent locally.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the plan does not seem to address the additionality of capital services or spending for mental health services.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, a member of the Independent Alliance, has waxed lyrical about the increases in current expenditure but Members on the front line who represent people who need access to services and a continuum of care from childhood to adulthood and into their senior years do not see evidence in the plan of moneys becoming available for capital expenditure on necessary mental health services, such as housing and other ancillary services.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to be cognisant of that and to raise it as an issue.

I welcome the Minister of State and his official, who I know well.  The national planning framework, NPF, and capital plan, as outlined to such ridiculous fanfare last week, is a fraud.  They have no basis in law - I say \"they\" because there are two parts to it -  and contain nothing more than planning aspirations and a wish list of capital projects.  Frankly, what the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, articulated in the D&aacute;il yesterday simply is not true.  To be blunt, these documents have no basis in law and cannot be put on a statutory footing without a vote on the national planning framework as currently drafted.  If that does not take place, it will not be legal.  I say this as the Minister who sponsored the original Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, brought it to Government and had it passed through the Cabinet in the first place.  Ironically, I spent more time working on this plan than either the current Minister or his predecessor because they had such short durations in the Custom House.  The Bill clearly states that the Government \"shall submit the draft of the revised or new National Planning Framework, together with the Environmental Report and Appropriate Assessment Report for the approval of each House of the Oireachtas before it is published\".  It is very clear.<\/p>  <p>  I have been listening to Ministers repeatedly try to squirm out of this fact.  They have failed miserably to do so.  Consequently, this NPF and capital plan has no legal basis and there is no underpinning legislative basis that stands up about which they can be 100% sure.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, knows I have good time for him personally but I believe what he is doing is the most reckless action I have seen in this House since the bank bailout in 2008.

I am not alone in that view.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said the Government did not need a vote because the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill was not passed, but he did not tell us the legislation on which the Government was relying.  That is to leave aside the moral argument that this Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill was, without a shadow of a doubt, and the Minister of State knows this, the actual underpinning legislation.<\/p>  <p>  We then had Ministers waffling on about how there had already been a vote on the plan.  It was embarrassing to watch them.  There was not a vote on it.  That is just a lie.  There were statements on the old plan and then votes on the legislation underpinning the plan, which has not even been concluded yet.  Where was the vote on the plan?

The final report of the independent review of the performance of planning functions, having regard to specific issues raised in respect of six planning authorities, was submitted in July 2015.  There are 29 recommendations in that report and I had to consider and publish them.  In tandem with this, the remaining planning related recommendations of the Mahon tribunal had to be dealt with, particularly the establishment of a new independent office of the planning regulator.<\/p>  <p>  A further related element concerned the development of the national planning framework currently being discussed, which was to be put on a statutory footing under the Bill in line with one of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.

I wish to thank Deputies for facilitating this Bill, the agreement that we would make progress and, in that regard, facilitate the taking of all Stages this evening.  It is a short Bill, the sole purpose of which is to ensure that the same age limits apply to internal and external candidates for appointment to the ranks of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda Commissioner.  The immediate impetus for the Bill is the upcoming competition for the next Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  Before proceeding, I would like to acknowledge the dedication and service of acting Garda Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in.  The former Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, announced her retirement last autumn and now, for the first time, the independent Policing Authority, working in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service, will conduct the selection process for a Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  Shortly after the former Commissioner announced her retirement, I engaged with the chairperson of the Policing Authority and the authority has undertaken a significant amount of work to prepare for the appointment process.  I want to acknowledge the hard work and dedication undertaken so far.<\/p>  <p>  The Government formally triggered the statutory process contained in section 9 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, for the selection and appointment of the next Commissioner last December.  I am pleased to say that preparations for the competition, which will be an open, international competition without any restriction as to nationality or policing experience, are almost finalised.  However, before the competition can proceed, I seek the support of the House to rectify an anomaly that has the effect of barring an external candidate aged 55 years or older from appointment as Garda Commissioner.  The anomaly dates from 2004 and is an unintended effect of the retirement regime introduced at that time for new entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a time when the long-standing tradition dating from the 1960s was to appoint the Commissioner from within the ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This unintended age bar does not have a logical basis and in the context of an open, competitive process, unnecessarily restricts the field of candidates for the leadership of what is one of the most important public service jobs in the State.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, the overriding concern of the Government is that the best possible candidate is selected to take on the leadership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government has no preference as to whether the person is an internal or external candidate; rather the Government&rsquo;s concern is to ensure that the selection process attracts the widest possible pool of high-calibre candidates and that whoever is selected and nominated by the authority for appointment by the Government is tested against a strong field.  Seeking to ensure a level playing field in regard to the age of appointment is part of this concern and has the support of the Policing Authority and the Public Appointments Service.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the Bill itself, it amends the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  It contains two sections.  Section 1 is the substantive section, while section 2 contains the general provisions in regard to the Short Title, collective citation and commencement.<\/p><p> Section 1 amends section 4 of the 2004 Act.  For the assistance of Deputies, I will set out the background and purpose of section 4.  In essence, section 4 introduced a new retirement regime for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who enter on or after 1 April 2004.  The retirement of those who entered prior to that date continues to be governed by regulations made under the Garda Acts.  While section 4 maintained the maximum age of retirement at 60 for all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it made it conditional for new entrants on or after 1 April 2004 on health and other checks.  The purpose of this conditional approach is to ensure the operational capacity of the police service.  Specifically, section 4 provides that a new entrant shall \"cease to be a member\" of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na \"on attaining the age of 55 years\" but may continue to 60 years subject to the Commissioner being satisfied that \"the member is fully competent and available to undertake, and fully capable of undertaking, the duties of his or her position as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\".  Where the member concerned is the Commissioner, it is the Minister for Justice and Equality who must satisfy himself or herself as to capability and competency.<\/p> <p> The Attorney General has advised that the manner in which section 4 is constructed has the effect of excluding appointment to the rank of Commissioner of a person who is not already a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to attaining the age of 55.  It has the same effect in relation to the rank of deputy commissioner.  Accordingly, the Government has made the decision to amend the legislation to better support an open competition.  Quite apart from the importance of ensuring a level playing field between internal and external candidates, it puts prospective external candidates who may already be 54 in the unenviable position of trying to determine whether it is worthwhile applying for the competition and running the risk of aging-out before the process concludes.  I see Deputy O'Callaghan is amused.  I admit that it is somewhat technical and may result in difficulty and perhaps some unfairness.  To rectify this anomaly, therefore, section 1 of the Bill inserts a new section 4(4).  It provides that nothing in that section shall prevent the appointment, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to the rank of Commissioner or deputy commissioner of a person who has attained the age of 55 years but is under the age of 60 as a new entrant to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Section 1 also inserts a new subsection (5) to clarify that the regime in section 4 in relation to medical and other checks applies to such appointees.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that these amendments make no change to the retirement regime in operation for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The regime approved by the Oireachtas in 2004 under which all those who join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on or after 1 April of that year cease to be members on attaining the age of 55 but may continue to 60 subject to certain conditions, remains intact.  This provision, in conjunction with regulations made by the Government recently, means that any person appointed to the office of Commissioner on foot of the upcoming competition shall serve for five years or until he or she attains the age of 60 years, whichever is the earlier.<\/p> <p> As I have previously said, the independent Policing Authority, working in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, will for the first time conduct the selection process for a Garda Commissioner.  I am advised that the selection process itself is likely to take approximately four months from the launch date.  Further time may then be required depending on the candidate.  My colleagues and I in government are keen to remove any possible obstacle to ensuring the best possible candidate can be identified to lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and deliver the best policing services to the people of Ireland.  I am keen for the competition to proceed without delay and thank Members for their support in facilitating the legislation and for their co-operation with the, hopefully, speedy passage of this short but nevertheless important Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100031#KK01200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519226100,"counter":503,"content":"<p>As the Minister has stated, the Bill is being introduced to deal with a very specific situation.

I say that while also recognising the importance of ensuring a thorough process is gone through in order that the right person is appointed.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2005 Act, as amended, there is a very complicated process for appointing a Garda Commissioner.  The Public Appointments Service plays a role, as do the Policing Authority and the Government.  The role of the Public Appointments Service is to run a competition.

The Act states that the Public Appointments Service shall run a competition for the purpose of determining who should be appointed to the position of Garda Commissioner.  I have my own reservations as to whether a PAS competition will necessarily identify the best candidate for a high-level appointment like this but notwithstanding my concerns, that is the process which must be gone through.  I presume the Policing Authority will be involved in formulating the competition with the Public Appointments Service.  Once the competition is completed, recommendations will be made by the Policing Authority to the Government as to whom it thinks should be appointed to the position of Garda Commissioner.  The Government is fairly limited in what it can do on receipt of the recommendation.  It can reject it only in very specific terms and must then ask the authority for another recommendation.  When one looks at the matter overall, it is the Policing Authority and the Public Appointments Service which will play a crucial role to identify the candidate for formal appointment by Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is necessary, as the Minister has indicated.  It identifies an anomaly in the current legislation.  To put it simply, a current member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must retire at 55 unless he or she is allowed to stay on until age 60 with the Commissioner's consent.  The Government, the Public Appointments Service and Policing Authority want to ensure that as broad a range of people as possible apply for the position.  There are many fine candidates within the force who will no doubt apply.  What we also want to do, however, is extend the competition beyond the force so that persons who are not members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na apply too.  It is anomalous that if one is outside the force, one must be under the age of 55 to apply.  However, a member of the force is able to apply up to age 60 on foot of the rule I have just identified.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was correct that it brought a smile to my face when he said there was a risk people could age out of the process.  It is very unusual that we get rid of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at 55 and that we are limiting applicants to the position to individuals who are under the age of 60.  Many important positions in this country are held by people who are over the age of 60 and who fulfil them very effectively.  I say that looking over at my colleague, the Minister, who I believe has reached that milestone in his life.  It is unusual to provide that the only people who can apply for this are under the age of 60.  It may be the case that individuals who are over that age are otherwise eligible and would do a very effective and useful job.  It is a discussion for another day but we need to broaden our perspective on the capacity of people to do jobs and should not reject them simply because they have reached the age of 60, which I am sure the Minister will agree is comparatively young.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill.  It is important to get it through the House promptly and that the range of those who can apply for the position of Commissioner is as broad as possible.  The Minister and the State should look in due course at extending the age of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a great deal of corporate knowledge within the force.  I read the EY report on the Minister's own Department.  The report points out that there is a great deal of high level and other corporate knowledge within the Department of Justice and Equality, which is at risk of being lost where people retire and move on.  Similarly, there are many members at senior and indeed less senior ranks within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a wide range of corporate knowledge.  We must ensure that we do not lose all that knowledge from the force through the mandatory retirement ages of 55 and 60, respectively.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to start the process.  I wish the Public Appointments Service and the Policing Authority well in running the competition to which it is important to attract as many applicants as possible.<\/p><p>It is a fantastic opportunity for any individual to be Garda Commissioner.  Very few people in this country have had that privilege in the past.  It is one of the finest positions in the country and I have no doubt that many applicants will put their names forward.  It is important that we get the right candidate for the job, irrespective of whether that person is from within or outside the force.  My only concern is that we are limiting the candidates who can apply for this job to people under the age of 60, which is unusual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100032#LL00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519226700,"counter":505,"content":"<p>We wish to put on record the fact that we will be supporting the Bill.  To a large extent, this is a relatively minor technical Bill.  It is intended to address the unintended effect of the retirement provision applying to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who entered the service on or after 1 April 2004 and external candidates for appointment to the rank of Garda Commissioner or that of deputy Garda commissioner.  It relates to section 4 of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, which states that such members of the force shall cease to be members on attaining 55 years of age but may continue on to 60 years subject to checks.  However, the provision has the unintended effect of creating a bar on the appointment of persons aged 55 or more to the rank of Garda Commissioner or that of deputy Garda commissioner where those persons would be external applicants.  Clearly, that is not a sensible situation and we support legislation to rectify such an unintended consequence.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the process be as open as possible to external candidates.  We have previously expressed a view that it would be preferable to have an external candidate take on the position of Garda Commissioner for a number of reasons, one of which is that, frankly, it would be invidious at this stage for somebody within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take on the position.  I think a person from within the force would find matters difficult from the outset.  We should be looking at external candidates and, very likely, people from outside the country.  It is possible that the Minister has commented on this already but if there is any update as regards the process for the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, that would obviously be welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously expressed the view to the Minister that I would have thought it preferable that there be an extended period whereby there is an acting Garda Commissioner, as is currently the case.  I have also previously expressed the view that it would have been preferable for the recommendations on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to have been reported before a Garda Commissioner was appointed in order to allow the Public Appointments Service and the Policing Authority to take account of those recommendations.  While the Minister is proceeding in any event, I still have concerns in this regard.  This is going to be a crucial appointment.  With the right appointment, along with enthusiastic implementation on the part of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it may be possible to draw a line under recent controversies and begin a new future in this State.  However, as I said, that will require the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to come up with radical proposals and these must be implemented fully and enthusiastically by the Government.  It is essential, therefore, that this appointment is got right.<\/p>  <p>  I would add to Deputy O'Callaghan's observation regarding the maximum age, which, even after this legislation is enacted, will be 60.  It is unusual that we require garda&iacute; to retire at that age.  I look at other areas where we are at the other extreme in the sense that we are forcing employees to work for longer, perhaps up to the age of 67 or 68, in places where they would rather not be.  In many circumstances, the people who will be forced to work later are those least likely to be able to work later.  However, in the case of garda&iacute;, we have people who would very much like to remain in service and who are perfectly capable of so doing, but who are prevented from so doing.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, the legislation is technical and is intended to rectify an anomaly.  We will support it.  I hope it will assist in ensuring that the process for appointing a new Garda Commissioner is robust and that the right person is appointed in order to ensure a new era in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100033#MM00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1519226700,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Sherlock.

It is important and pleasing to me that we are at one in our objective of seeing the best possible candidate appointed to lead An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I said, I do not have any specific preference, nor does the Government, in terms of whether the person is an internal or an external candidate, or someone from overseas.<\/p>  <p>  Whoever comes through the process, regardless of whether he or she is a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, he or she will face a pretty substantial job of work.  The person will be required to implement the major reform programme under way, to improve governance and performance management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to continue to build managerial capacity and to enhance service delivery, while continuing to ensure that the organisation has the capability and capacity to secure the State and keep its citizens safe and protected.  The person will also be required to implement any further strategic reforms to the sector generally that may flow from the work of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  In that regard, I listened attentively to the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  From my engagement with the chair of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, Ms Kathleen O'Toole, I know she shares my concern that a careful deliberative process be undertaken and that the best possible candidate be selected.  The commission has a wealth of experience and expertise to bring to the process being undertaken by the Policing Authority.  As I have said, the approach that has been followed has allowed the authority to engage with the commission in respect of how it perceives the future role and responsibilities of the Garda Commissioner and this will assist in ensuring that the potential candidates have as much information as possible on the landscape that is the future of policing in our State.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Bill can pass all Stages as quickly as possible.

It would be terrible if people over 60 years would be disqualified.  Considering the experience they may have garnered in their lives, it would not be rational.  We have been involved in raising many issues on the workings of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from as long ago as 2012.  Conor Brady noted recently that the question is not merely one of a new Commissioner.  Many issues are at stake.  We remain very disappointed in the Government's approach to bringing in real change to how things are done and to bring our police force to a place where all Irish people can be proud.  We find the Government's position has been poor and unfortunately, despite all the years of controversy, there are many ways in which not much has changed.  Some things have changed, but not enough.  It would be terrible if the work of people such as Maurice McCabe or John Wilson eventually came to naught, because the people want things to be done differently.  Deputy Clare Daly and I met another Garda whistleblower late last year after receiving a large amount of detailed information through the <i>namaleaks.com<\/i>website.  In what is becoming a familiar story with whistleblowers in this country, the garda in question spotted a problem in how policing was done at a station where he served.  He brought the issue to his superiors' attention in the belief that they might address the problem and perhaps even thank him.  In a small way, he managed some of that but what he did not expect was he would have to face a majority of superiors and colleagues who did not like what he was doing.  His pursuit of the issue ended up with him being reprimanded by his superiors and alienated from his colleagues.  Eventually, after six years of not being supported, he was forced to take stress-related sick leave in December 2016.  Things got worse a little over a year later.  Stressed, in despair and needing help, the garda found himself in a bad place and ended up unresponsive on the back seat of a bus.  Two garda&iacute; arrived to remove him but removing him was not enough so they gave him a good clipping.  When they realised the fellow they were clipping was also a garda, the two garda&iacute; scuttled off and left him behind.  Not alone had he been chewed up and spat out by the Garda system but when he was at his lowest and really needed support - as might any of us at times - he got a punch on the way down.  <\/p><p>The whistleblower&rsquo;s crime and how it had come to this was as simple as discovering blatant non-enforcement of liquor licensing laws.  He found there were favoured publicans who were allowed to run pubs with immunity and without proper licensing in the Killarney area.  When the whistleblower attempted to enforce the law and change things so all publicans would be treated equally, he was discouraged by his colleagues, alienated and ridiculed.  On one occasion, rather than encourage this garda to enforce the law, an inspector, a next-door neighbour of one favoured publican, issued a breach of regulation report against the garda because he put the incorrect address on an envelope.  In May 2016, the whistleblower encountered an after-hours street brawl during which the premises known as McSorleys in Killarney continued to serve patrons.  After dealing with the brawl, the garda confronted the publican.  About a week later he was reprimanded by an inspector for harassing this serial offending publican.  The Garda whistleblower was encouraged to come to an arrangement with the publican or the inspector said he would send a complaint up the line and the whistleblower would not come out well of an investigation.  This same inspector threatened to use CCTV footage, supplied by the publican, to destroy this garda unless he apologised and came to an arrangement with the law-breaking publican.  In total, this garda prepared 16 files under liquor licensing laws for prosecution.  One of them was successful and resulted in a &euro;150 fine but in many cases the summonses were not issued, not lodged or withdrawn.  When they did reach the court the summonses were often struck out.  In one case the judge bizarrely cleared the courtroom before striking out the case.  On 6 December 2016 the whistleblower went sick.  On 20 December 2016, Killarney garda&iacute; were quoted in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>as saying, without a hint of irony, &ldquo;they have a tough approach to late night drinking and drunkenness in the town - and to compliance with the liquor licensing laws&quot;.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100034#NN02800","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1519227300,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I remind Deputy Wallace that the debate is on Committee Stage of the Bill on when one can be appointed under the age of 60 years.

The conviction rate for the whole of County Kerry in 2016 was 3%.  <\/p>  <p>  Across the country there are even more bizarre anomalies that require further scrutiny.  From 2012 to 2016 the total number of prosecutions in Wicklow and Arklow towns was two, neither of which resulted in a prosecution.  Either publicans are so compliant in these areas that the garda&iacute; there can spend their time looking after the Christmas trees or the garda&iacute; have just ignored that licensing laws need to be enforced.  Dundalk, with a 30% conviction rate from 2010 to 2016, illustrates the lack of consistency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100034#NN03000","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1519227900,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Deputy Wallace is taking a wide interpretation.

There is considerable urgency in the appointment of a new Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  There is a certain irony in the situation when Mr. Martin Callinan resigned or jumped or was pushed - who knows - and Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was eventually appointed to the job.  We were told that she was the best person for the job, that it was a full open competition - open to everybody internationally - and there was no name on the position, but the job description that was put forward required a level of knowledge of the functioning of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which nobody but Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan had at that time.  We warned then that the Government was on a hiding to nothing by repeating the mistakes of the past and by failing to take on board that there were systemic problems at the top of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that required a fresh approach.  It is not about named individuals rather it is about institutionalised complacency, a way of working that needs to be broken up, and the only way of breaking that up is by getting in fresh blood from outside.  Fresh blood can be somebody who is over the age of 55.  I believe that a life's experience is good knowledge for a Garda Commissioner to have.<\/p>  <p>  Since the resignation of Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, we have had somebody else from the old hierarchy stepping into the breach.  Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in stepped in and immediately goes and sits with the lads down the back at a retirement course.  In essence, we have had an organisation that has been rudderless since then because there is nobody at the top.  Everybody knows the person who is at the top has no interest in staying there, is sitting in at pre-retirement courses and has had neither the energy nor the enthusiasm to revitalise this organisation in the way in which it should be.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just about one person rather it is about the approach of senior management.  We attended the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality last week when representatives of Garda management were there to deal with the homicide figures.  It was a lesson in how in some ways nothing has changed.  It would be quite clear to anybody who watched the proceedings of that good committee meeting - the committee equipped itself well and worked co-operatively and constructively in trying to get answers from Garda management - that they were gaining an insight into a strange relationship between the civilian staff inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and senior management and yet a good relationship potentially between the civilian staff and rank and file garda&iacute;.  The head of data analysis, Dr. Gurchand Singh, made the point, because, unfortunately, the committee hearings were on the day of the funeral of Detective Superintendent Colm Fox, that front-line officers such as the late Detective Superintendent Fox had co-operated well and shared data, but the implication was that the same level of co-operation with garda&iacute; on the front line did not exist among senior management.  There is an enormous problem with senior management inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Government has been blind to and it is doomed to repeat the same mistakes.  While the future policing road show is doing the rounds to tell us what the Garda Inspectorate report told us in 2014 - it epitomises the Government in that there are many announcements, much strategy and much spin when, in fact, we all know what needs to be done anyway - we have this position at the top, which sets the tone, but which has not been filled yet.  There is an urgency in that regard and that is why we support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We want this position filled quickly, but on the right basis.  Deputy Wallace is correct.  We were told that there is a new system of promotions, and this, in essence, is a promotion, with the new system of the Policing Authority supposedly vetting senior appointments inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Very recently, however, senior promotions have been made, with some people who are the subject of disciplinary investigations being appointed, and we were told that could not happen.  We have a senior officer being promoted even though he is the subject of an investigation as a result of a complaint of bullying and harassment by a whistleblower.  It is unbelievable.  What makes it more sad is that this is in the Minister's own constituency.<\/p>  <p>  We know that two young people have died in the Minister's constituency.  A young man and a young woman died as a result of the drugs trade in the midlands where it has been established that garda&iacute; are involved in that trade with drug pushers in that area, and not a single person has been charged.  Not only has the complaint of the garda who came forward with evidence of that not been investigated, but the senior officer against whom he submitted the subsequent bullying and harassment complaint was promoted a number of weeks ago.  One could not make it up.<\/p>  <p>  We have a narrative from the Government telling us that it has learned the lessons and it is on the right road to a new transformed police force, but the reality on the ground is different.  It is not only in Kerry, shocking and all as the information is that Deputy Wallace put on the record is, but the involvement in the drugs trade in the Minister's own back yard.  That, more than anything else, shows that there is really no appetite for reform in this area.<\/p>  <p>  We will support the legislation today but much of it is for show.  We need much more delivered than we have had so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100035#OO00600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519227900,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519227900,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519227900,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519227900,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Project Ireland 2040: Statements (Resumed)","time":1519228500,"counter":554,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100036#PP00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1519228500,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I have gone back through all the relevant documentation and read what I brought forward in December 2015 and it is absolutely definite, in my view, what the Government's decision was then.  As the former Minister with responsibility in this area, I have reread the documents that were put forward at the time and it is very clear that this plan needs a vote of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I have checked this with my Labour colleagues who sat at the Cabinet table with me and they are of the same opinion.  The reason the provision for a vote was included is that, following discussions with officials, it was felt the framework had to be a million miles away from the previous plan, namely, the much-maligned national spatial strategy.  That plan was correctly perceived as a great example of stroke politics, with something for every person at the Cabinet table.  Therefore, the intention at the time was, through the new framework, to ensure this would never happen again and ensure complete Oireachtas buy-in, hence my ensuring there would be a vote on the final framework.<\/p>  <p>  My successor, the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, when speaking on Second Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 on 28 September 2016, endorsed what I had brought to Government and had been agreed ten months earlier.  He said, \"the framework shall be subject to the provisions of relevant EU environmental directives; and that the Government shall submit the draft of a revised or new framework for the approval of the Oireachtas before it is published and shall have regard to any resolution of the Oireachtas in the finalisation of the NPF\".  What part of this is not clear?  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, on 7 May 2016 he invited all Deputies and Senators to the audiovisual room for a briefing on the national planning framework, which was to take place on 15 June of that year.  In an email that came from his private secretary, he stated that, as provided for under the provisions of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, and in response to the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, the final framework document would be subject to the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in view of the fact that it would shape regional, spatial and economic strategies, county development plans and the planning decisions of local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I could not agree more.  In his PowerPoint presentation on 9 November 2016, he committed to same again.  It is, therefore, crystal clear that there was a requirement, which I brought forward in the legislation, to ensure there would be a vote in this House and in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the national planning framework.<\/p>  <p>  It seems the T&aacute;naiste got this, although he can no longer remember it, but then the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, came along and did not get it.  He seemed motivated to forget about this commitment once he entered the Custom House.  Why is that the case?  The answer, I believe, is quite simple.  This Government could not guarantee that it would win the subsequent vote on the national planning framework, it had forgotten to include it in the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il and it would hardly countenance losing such a critical vote and the consequent golden public relations opportunity which has now been seized with such fanfare.  This is especially the case now that the Government has begun linking the new framework with the capital spending plan.  There was no intention to link the national planning framework and the capital plan originally.  The Taoiseach inadvertently admitted this last week.  The capital plan was meant to be launched some time ago, he said - over six months ago.  However, it was so far behind schedule that the Government now thought it would look politically mature to put it all together and pretend this was planned all along.  It was not.  By linking the two plans, there was no way, this Government felt, in all the confusion it would create, that the Opposition could come into the House and vote against &euro;115 billion in capital spending.  It would be political suicide to do so.  The Taoiseach again let the cat out of the bag last week when he said the Opposition was terrified of the then imminent announcement of the plans.  What is terrifying is for the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to stake his political future on doing something that I, and all my colleagues who sat beside me at the Cabinet table, believe is legally unsound.  All of us in the Labour Party have the same view.<\/p>  <p>  Trust me, this will come back to haunt the Government and the Minister.  There is absolutely no 100% sound statutory legislation underpinning this national framework.  I do not say this lightly but I do want it recorded in this forum that that is my prediction.  Some parts of the planning code require planning authorities to have regard to the National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020, published by the then Government on 28 November 2002.  Other provisions require the authorities to have regard to the national spatial strategy \"or any document published by the Government which amends or replaces that Strategy\".  The Government, in its publication, did not even link this framework to that spatial strategy.  The Government did not say it repealed or abrogated it or that it was a new version of it, so it is not a replacement.<\/p>  <p>  Eventually the Government will have to try to put this on a statutory footing somehow.  The only way to do so is to subject it to votes and amendments on the floors of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I predict that this will have to happen.  If the Government tries to push this through and bluff it, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill is not the vehicle by means of which it can get a vote to justify the statutory process that is needed.  I ask the House to imagine the scenario in which the Government will now be left.  It will have to come before this House and ask us to pass the national planning framework and we will all look to change it in some way.  I predict that the Government will have to do this because otherwise the plan is simply a vision of aspirations and thoughts.  To look on the bright side, after the Government is forced to debate the framework in the D&aacute;il - and it will be amended - it will at least have the fanfare of launching it all over again.  Anyone worth his or her salt who walks into court to challenge this on the basis, say, of the ridiculous caps that are to be put on planning in different local authority areas will win.  He or she will be able to quote one third of the members of the Government and what their views of it were at the time.  He or she will be able to quote what I am saying now and the documents to which I have referred.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from the obvious issue of not having any statutory footing, there are two other reasons why I believe this plan is legally flawed due to the process adopted.  The legislation commits the Government to submit an environmental report as part of the approval to the Oireachtas.  This has not been done.  A strategic environmental assessment, SEA, scoping exercise is not sufficient.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in its submission in respect of this plan said this had to be on a statutory footing.  I suggest that the officials and the Minister read the submission.  There is also the most basic and obvious reason why this will fall legally.  As far as public consultation is concerned, there has been no truthful engagement in respect of this plan during the final leg of its journey.  The final national planning framework is a very different version to the one that was released a few months ago.  The fundamentals of it have changed.  For example, the tiered nature of picking some towns over others for special status is completely new.  What have the people of Tullamore, Mullingar or Nenagh to say about this?  We will never know because they have not been consulted.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and the Government are in big trouble on the national planning framework, and I do not say this lightly.  The capital plan is tied with the framework so, by bringing them together, the Government has jeopardised both.<\/p><p>I believe they should be together but only after the legislation is passed and the national planning framework is voted on, which was my intention when I brought forward the legislation in the first place.  For perceived political advantage reasons the Government has jeopardised them both.  The spatial strategy of 2002 was stroke politics, but in fairness to Fianna F&aacute;il in typical format at least we could see it coming at us.  This strategy and plan is underhand, cynical, unethical, legally unsound and wrong.  I can tell the Government out straight that anyone in opposition, and particularly we in the Labour Party, will not and cannot be bound by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100036#PP00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":557,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I remember standing here back in 2013 when Deputy Kelly was Minister and he and his colleagues destroyed our local democracy and abolished the town councils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":558,"content":"<p>That is not at point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":559,"content":"<p>We had no vote on it either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":560,"content":"<p>That is not a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":561,"content":"<p>We had no vote on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Okay, it is not a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Now he wants to have his cake and eat it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00800","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Please Deputy, it is not a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":565,"content":"<p>He did not have a vote on it either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ01000","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229100,"counter":566,"content":"<p>It is not a point of order.

I am a strong advocate of the idea of democratically and rationally decided plans in which we decide where to build, what to build, how to build and what to produce so the needs of our citizens are met.  This is the definition of a plan for development for the country.  I was delighted to read that Project Ireland 2040 emphasises social outcomes and values ahead of economic targets.  On one level, the very fact the Government has produced a 22 year plan is a tacit acknowledgement that the free market and allowing the private sector to rule and decide everything does not produce wholesome outcomes.  It is an acknowledgement that the State has a role in planning and that is good.  It acknowledges what is good and what is needed in our country and that everything cannot be left to the whims of the market and the corporations in the pursuit of profits.  Except, of course, this is not a 22 year plan and it is not anything remotely new or visionary.  It is a repackaged bundle of previously announced capital programmes wrapped in a reheated aspirational framework.  It is akin to a scene from &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; that we seem destined to repeat in this country again and again under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.<\/p><p>I want to plagiarise Gene Kerrigan's article from the weekend in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>.  He stated Project Ireland 2040:<\/p><blockquote>is a 20-year strategy designed to enable every place in the country to reach its potential, no matter what its size or location.  It recognises that the various regions of the country have different roles... It is about making regions competitive according to their strengths and not against one another; about ensuring a high quality urban environment, as well as vibrant rural areas.<\/blockquote><p>Except, as Gene Kerrigan points out, this is not a quote from Project Ireland 2040, but from the now forgotten - except this discussion keeps raising it - national spatial strategy of 2002 under Fianna F&aacute;il, the huge success of which can still be seen on our streets, in our congested towns and cities, in our ghost estates, in the schemes built on floodplains, in pyrite-riddled houses and in once-off housing well away from any services such as schools or public transport.<\/p><p>Project Ireland 2040 follows in a long tradition of failed and non-existent plans, where aspirations are sacrificed at the first resistance from the market or in the interests of the financial elites.  Will Project Ireland 2040 be different?  It is different mostly by its scale and by the scale of public money used to announce and publicise it.  We cannot go to the cinema or switch on the television or radio without seeing what is, in effect, a general election broadcast for Fine Gael, promising to cure all of our ills by 2040.  We will have three new hospitals, urban and rural regeneration worth &euro;3 billion, new motorways, new metros and tramlines all by 2040.<\/p><p>We cannot deal with the trolley crisis we have now, which has worsened and developed over the seven years Fine Gael has been in government.  We cannot deal with a housing crisis that sees tens of thousands of children and adults homeless and 100,000 in housing need.  We cannot bring funding for our public transport services back to the levels they were at before the crisis.  We cannot even build a proper city in Dublin because everything we do means it gets more and more congested.  However, according to the plan, we will build a shiny city overlooking the Atlantic, which will be the envy of the best northern European cities with great transport, great schools, great health services and a natural environment to be wondered at.  This will not happen.  It is a fraud and a fantasy and, to quote the song written by the famous migrant worker in America who organised migrant workers to seek their rights, Joe Hill, we will get pie in the sky.<\/p><blockquote>From the day of your birth<br \/><br \/>It's bread and water here on earth...<br \/><br \/>But there'll be pie in the sky<br \/><br \/>By and by when I die<\/blockquote><p>This is exactly what we are getting with the plan.<\/p><p>The greatest con of the plan is also its most ironic.  Coming just months after the collapse of Carillion in Britain, this plan is essentially a proposal not just for public private partnerships but a version of public private partnerships on steroids.  In 2015, the Government enacted a measure to ensure no Department spent more than 10% of its budget on public private partnership.  While making a huge chunk of public infrastructure and services reliant on private finance at least there was some limit to this type of disaster and some limit to the type of Carillion we might see.  This will be gone with the plan.  The plan will mean a feeding frenzy for public private partnerships and private financial speculation.  It will hold key public assets and goods to ransom.  Assets and goods we need for our citizens will effectively be in the hands of private companies and financial interests.  We know from experience here and internationally this costs the State multiples more than if it were to borrow to build the projects and fund them directly itself.  One report suggests the capital costs of a typical public private partnership or private finance initiative costs 8%, double of the long-term Government borrowing rate of 4% and that the outcome in terms of quality, design and accountability of projects built by the State is much better than it is in a public private partnership or private finance initiative.<\/p><p>Far from the rhetoric of public private partnerships transferring the financial risk from the State to the private sector, the reality is the State takes all of the risks and pays more for private finance.  A 2013 study found there is no strong evidence to suggest public private partnerships have delivered better value for taxpayer's money.  There is evidence to the contrary, and yet effectively this entire plan is based on the Godzilla of all public private partnerships.  We will have more M50 toll disasters, more collapsed projects such as the regeneration of O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's estate and more desperately needed homes and schools hanging in the balance dependent on the machinations of private companies such as Carillion, except the scale will be bigger than ever before.  In the years ahead, our national development will be dictated more and more by the needs and profit opportunities of bankers and developers.  The plan and its various projects will not be decided by the regional planning forums and least of all by the needs of the people.  It will be decided on the needs of bankers and developers.<\/p><p>The public homes that our citizens need will be built when the finance the private sector wants to use is found.  This will be dictated not by the needs of the people who live in this country, or by what is good, rational and environmentally sound, but by the profit margin these companies need and the profits they want.  We are told a new national regeneration development agency has been set up to manage public sites and will be given compulsory purchase powers if private sites are needed for housing.  However, these powers already exist and there are legislative means to use a compulsory purchase order to obtain land.  What we do not have is the political will to do so.  We do not have a Government that is willing to declare housing a national emergency and to build the homes needed.  I find it unlikely that a new agency will find the political will to take the measures needed, and our fear is this agency will do whatever the market, in the shape of developers and bankers, dictates and not what is contained in the plan.  Therefore, we repeat that we call it fraud and a fantasy.  The best of luck with it, but it is completely dependent on the whims of the market, financiers, developers and bankers and this is a flaw.  This is not planning, it is fantasy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100037#QQ03500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1519229700,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact we are having this debate.  Last week we had a multiplicity of announcements with great crash and thunder.  This evening we have an opportunity to drill down and ask some pertinent questions about the real content of this plan, to see if it is fit for purpose and discuss alternative approaches.<\/p><p>I want to look at the plan under a number of headings, including housing; public private partnerships, PPPs; climate change; public transport; some of the proposals relating to the area that I represent in Cork; and the need for real socialist planning.<\/p><p>One of the stark deficiencies in the national planning framework is the scant reference and attention given to our need for far more public housing.  The unmet housing need in the State today is in fact a multiple of the figure or more than 100,000 currently on local authority housing lists.  For a start, those on housing assistance payments, HAP, and therefore in the thrall of private landlords, are taken off the list, even though their fundamental housing needs have not been securely met.  However, these numbers in turn are dwarfed by the number of people, estimated to be in excess of 300,000, who have a housing need, cannot afford to buy in the open market and are excluded from applying for public housing.  The planing framework document says that the provision by Government of housing support for those unable to provide for accommodation from their own resources is a key social policy.  It does not seem to be a key social policy at the moment, or if it is, it is in name only.  From the perspective of the locked out generation, just as much for those languishing for up to 15 years on allocation lists, it certainly does not seem like a key social policy.  The short-term target for all housing construction in the document is between 30,000 and 35,000 units, which is not enough.  To clear the backlog of unmet housing need we need State-led planning and construction to increase that by at least a factor of three.<\/p><p>I recommend to the Government and to every Deputy in this House an article in last week's <i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>by the academics Mick Byrne, Michelle Norris and Anna Carnegie, entitled &quot;Our Housing Policy is Built on a False and Dangerous Premise&quot;.  This article picks apart the clich&eacute;s about tenure mix.  We hear a lot about tenure mix in Project Ireland 2040.  These clich&eacute;s which come from the political establishment are in reality a coded way of saying this Government has no intention of building enough public housing to cater for the existing lists, never mind the broader current and future public housing need.<\/p><p>We cannot resolve this crisis if we do not aspire to build and rebuild working-class communities on a scale we have not seen since the 1970s at least.  The article points out that the problems associated with some working-class communities are to be located in wider capitalism, citing factors like industrialisation.  The authors correctly point in the direction of achieving mixed tenure, in other words, effectively bringing all strata of the working and middle classes together by lifting the low income thresholds for social housing.<\/p><p>I must also address the issue of public private partnerships.  With all the crash and thunder of the new announcements last week, the Government hoped that we would not notice that a new policy was being sneaked in through the back door.  The framework includes a change of policy emanating from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe's Department.  That Department wants to ramp up the role of PPPs beyond the previous cap of 10% of the capital budget.  This is quite incredible, coming mere weeks after the disaster of the Carillon collapse in Britain.  We have seen the effect this is having and has had in this country.  There is now a major international debate about the value and wisdom of the PPP model.  It does not deliver the goods, it delivers the goods more at greater expense than other approaches and in many cases it is very bad for workers' rights.  What is the response of the Government?  It does not just stick with PPPs, it ramps them up hugely.<\/p><p>I cannot think of anything that better demonstrates this Government's abject worship of the capitalist market at the expense of ordinary people.  The 2040 plan would tie us into PPPs not just for motorways, but for projects building institutes of technology and the upgrade of 90 community nursing homes.  It cannot be contested by the Minister that PPP deals, some of which last 40 years and therefore two generations, come at a greater cost to the public purse.  Yes, the fiscal rules that he campaigned for and supports conveniently lead us to the door of these PPP arrangements, but it is time to call a halt.  I will make some points about the alternative to this later in my remarks. <\/p><p>On the issue of climate change, the Government's record is in sharp contrast to the aspirations of ordinary people.  What is the Government's record?  Ireland is the worst performing country in Europe in the action it is taking.  The State dropped 28 places last year and ranked 49th out of 59 according to the 2018 Climate Change Performance Index.  Ireland is missing its EU 2020 emission reduction targets.  We also produce highest volume of emissions per person in Europe, and the eighth highest in the world.  Contrast that with the Citizens' Assembly held last November, where 98% of members recommended putting climate change at the centre of Irish policy making.  This shows widespread support for action on environmental issues by the general public.  A full 100% of members recommended that the State should take a leadership role and assume responsibility for adapting existing structures.  I do not have time to go into all of the options available to the State to improve its record greatly on climate change, so I will deal with one, the question of public transport.<\/p><p>Successive Governments, led by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, have a rotten record on investment in public transport.  The amount of money going into Dublin Bus, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann is less than it was ten years ago.  More than 1.2 million commuters travel to work by car.  There is massive scope to drastically increase public transport use, but only by proper investment.  For example, German railway transport gets roughly nine times the amount of current subvention per head of population that Irish Rail does.  That is not including capital investment.  Trying to balance the books on the back of public transport workers will not improve the quality of public transport.  It will make it worse.  That is why we need a properly funded public transport system.  Irish Rail carries up to 155,000 passengers a day.  In 2016, Irish Rail carried 43 million passengers.  All of this plays a role in the creation of wealth in society.  With increases in intercity and DART routes, efficient, reliable and affordable public transport is a key requirement for working people across the State.  Simply returning the 2018 public service obligation to 2010 levels would see &euro;73 million returned to Irish Rail.  Reinstating the subvention taken from Irish rail since 2008 would see &euro;730 million returned.  Compare that to the fines of &euro;610 million facing the State for missing CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions targets in 2020.  This funding could begin to transform public transport services radically in this country.  Investment in environmentally friendly infrastructure and modernisation would dramatically reduce car numbers in city centres, while also reskilling thousands of workers.  A serious turn to investment in services through State subvention could see fares dramatically reduced and usage dramatically increased.<\/p><p>We calculate that with a &euro;500 million investment, fares could be reduced by half, which would open to the door to a massive turn away from the car to public transport services.  The Public Services International Research Unit has reported on the growing trend in municipalities and cities throughout Europe towards taking transport services back into public control as the failures of the private model and the efficiencies of public ownership become apparent through the state's ability to borrow and invest, control quality and favourable conditions for workers and commuters.  In the UK, 76% of those surveyed, according to recent polls, support the renationalisation of transport.  It would be enormously popular in this country to back public transport with major investment funded through a steeply progressive taxation system.<br\/><br\/>There are 171 references in this 158-page document to the word &quot;sustainable&quot;, yet genuinely sustainable policies are noticeably absent from it.<br\/><br\/>I refer to proposals in Project Ireland 2040 relating to Cork city, including road projects, the event centre, light rail and a tidal barrier.  Various road projects are mentioned in the document, including the Macroom bypass and the M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick, which is significant.  I am an advocate of switching funding in order that the majority of it goes towards public transport as opposed to roads but there is no doubt that a motorway linking Ireland's second and third cities is a necessity.  It is a third world scenario not to have that.  How will the road operate?  <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>reported last Sunday that there will be an increased use of public private partnerships.  It said, &quot;This raises the prospect of tolling on new motorways such as the M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick&quot;.  I would like the T&aacute;naiste, who is beating the drum in Cork on this issue, to answer whether the new motorway will be tolled.  It should not be tolled and it is right that information in this regard should be put out there from the get-go.<br\/><br\/>The Cork event centre is badly needed for concerts and the like.  As a member, I attended a meeting of Cork City Council in December 2014 when the funding proposals for this initiative were rolled out.  I made the point that night that if we had a State construction company, it would deliver the project far better than the private sector or a public private partnership.  I have been proven right in that regard.  If a state construction company had taken on that project, it would be built or almost built by now, but not a single brick has been laid on the basis of the PPP model.  How expensive it is proving to be for the taxpayer as well.  The original plan was for a &euro;50 million event centre with &euro;20 million to be provided by the taxpayer.  Now it seems that the T&aacute;naiste has negotiated a deal for the same event centre costing &euro;73 million, although the cinema has been taken out in favour of office space, with &euro;30 million being provided by the taxpayer.  Is &euro;10 million being provided indirectly on top of that?  The <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>reported last week that &euro;10 million in State funding would be provided for so-called support infrastructure for the centre.  What is that support infrastructure?  This deal is shrouded in secrecy and people need to be told what exactly is going on.  When this PPP is hammered out, who will control the building and the land?  What is the State getting for its investment?  Is it merely providing a donation to the private sector to do something that could have been done many years ago more quickly and for much less money, with the centre remaining in the ownership and control of the people?<br\/><br\/>The document refers to the much needed and long awaited northern ring road for the city.  It says that a start will be made on that but I hope a middle and an ending will happen as well.  Reference is also made to a feasibility study for light rail.  Did the Minister of State ever hear of the land use and transportation survey, LUTS, which was a survey of transportation needs in Cork in the late 1970s?  That was a feasibility study, which recommended light rail.  We are 40 years on and we need feasibly studies matched quickly with funding.<br\/><br\/>There is not even provision for a feasibility study, let alone a project, when it comes to a tidal barrier and this tracks back to my earlier point on climate change.  World renowned expert, Professor Robert Devoy of University College Cork, says that a tidal barrier is a necessity for Cork and will become even more of a necessity as time goes by as we experience rising sea levels caused by global warming.  The OPW says a barrier would cost &euro;1 billion.  People who are well placed say that is not true.  HR Wallingford, an international engineering and hydraulics company, recently said it could be done for &euro;140 million.  That would be cheaper and more acceptable to the people of Cork, particularly those in the city centre, than the clumsy and not very people friendly flood defence plan being put in place by the OPW.  I reiterate my call for funding to be put aside for a tidal barrier.  It will be needed sooner or later and now would be the best time to provide it.<br\/><br\/>I am in favour of rational planning in respect of the resources within society.  I believe that such an approach does not sit well alongside the anarchy of the capitalist market.  If Ministers want to see in real terms what I mean by that, they should look at the history of this country over the past ten to 20 years.  The grand plans for infrastructure, including spatial strategies, and development which were the equivalent of Project Ireland 2040 in the early 21st century were put in place in 2000 and 2006 and then we had the global economic crash, the worst since the 1930s.  That did not just mean the vast bulk of the projects were put on the long finger but progress that had been made during the imperious Celtic tiger period was pushed back because of cutbacks and austerity.<\/p><p>There is a long history in this country of great plans and great visions being ruined and wrecked by the vagaries of the capitalist market, the anarchy of the capitalist market and the inevitability which is built into the capitalist market, both internationally and in Ireland, of booms and slumps which cut across the potential for rational, serious planning of the economy and of our resources.<\/p> <p> The projects announced last week, and others such as the Cork tidal barrier, can only be delivered soundly and securely by a society which takes its resources and then plans in a rational way.  It will not happen on the basis of private ownership for profit, but can only happen by taking the main levers of wealth in society into public hands and democratically controlling them for the benefit of each and every member of society.  There needs to be a break with the policies of the capitalist markets and a new, democratic and socialist society organised and planned for the interests of the majority or people, rather than the profits of an elite few.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100038#RR00100","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519230900,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Deputy Mick Wallace will share time with Deputies Clare Daly, Catherine Connolly and Thomas Pringle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100040#TT00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1519230900,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I had the pleasure of reading the plan over the weekend.  It was tough going and there was a lot of repetition in it.  I would probably have been better off reading some real fiction.  The idea of long-term planning makes sense as we are all too aware that just about every Government in the history of the State has worked from election to election, with the vested interests of politicians in their own areas overriding the national interest.  It is to be welcomed that the Government is taking a long-term view of where we are going and how we are going to spend our money in the next 22 years.<\/p>  <p>  I found what I read to be high on aspiration but I do not see a lot of change.  I welcome a plan which looks years ahead but I would have expected more on rail.  I had an argument with someone in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport about a year ago about increasing the use of rail but I was told that, in the short term, it was not economically viable and one would have to look into the very long term to see a serious return on investment.  I would have thought a long-term plan such as Project 2040 would have been kinder to the idea of rail.<\/p>  <p>  I was amused by the last Deputy to speak, who wants rail before road except for in Cork.  That is part of the problem we have in here.  On \"Morning Ireland\" last week, Dr. Edgar Morgenroth said the Cork-Limerick road was not actually a great idea, and he was involved in the early stages of designing that plan.  He said the original draft plan envisaged significant growth of the second tier cities, which is what is needed to anchor the economic activity in the weaker regions.  He said that without big cities in the regions, those areas that are not close to Dublin are simply going to continue to do quite badly, and that is what they have been doing.  He said that, in order to achieve this, it was important to put the infrastructure into the cities, not between them.  We have built a lot of road in Ireland but we have not built a lot of rail.  I was on a train from Turin to Milan at the weekend and it took 45 minutes, even though it is nearly as far as Dublin is from Cork.  Rail is absolutely wonderful to use and one can get to Milan or Turin for &euro;10.50, though it costs up to &euro;15 for the faster train and it is a bit more if one does not book in good time.<\/p>  <p>  Rail would be fantastic in this country.  It is obviously not as economically viable as in a country with 30 million or 60 million people but just because we live on a small island and have a small population, we should not reject it.  It is the way forward and if we were serious about addressing climate change we would do it.  I found Project 2040 light on the issue of climate change and I do not see us taking the challenges seriously enough.  We are talking about using biomass to supply energy instead of coal and turf but there are problems with biomass too and it will not tick the boxes over a period of time.  The Government is not taking climate change seriously and if it does not address it in a plan which looks 22 years into the future, it is particularly worrying.<\/p>  <p>  We have talked about housing here for so long that people are tired listening but that has not been addressed either.  We are not addressing how we supply housing.  Housing is unaffordable for too many people and I do not see any measures from the Government to address it.  It will eventually deal with the supply element but I do not see it dealing with affordability.  I do not accept that houses should be twice as dear in Ireland as they are in western Europe.  It has become too big a problem for too many people as they try to put a roof over their heads.  Some institutions have a cartel, particularly in Dublin, and since REITs came in we have turned a blind eye to NAMA selling all its property to them for peanuts.  We took this issue up with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who spoke of the professional landlord taking over the market but it was always going to end in tears.  The average rent for a two-bed apartment in Dublin is close to &euro;2,000 per month, which is just nonsense.  People cannot afford it and I do not see any proactive measures to tackle it.  I have looked at every housing measure brought in by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and the current Government and they are ignoring the fundamentals.  They are sowing the seeds for the next crash, which is inevitable given the approach being taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100040#TT00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1519230900,"counter":596,"content":"<p>State-led strategic development is the only way forward for any society that wants to advance itself.  Some of the initiatives taken by this State in the early years, particularly the 1930s when resources were far more scant than they are now, showed vision and we should be really embarrassed with what we are putting forward now in comparison.  We developed a national airline and transatlantic flights.  We picked Shannon for a focal point for regional development, rather than what it is now, namely, a US military air base with nothing.  We had the electrification of the country, for which the semi-State ESB linked up with Siemens in Germany.  They were so visionary that the talk was of people being fried in their beds, such was the electrical output that was envisaged.<\/p><p>Look where that got us.  Look at that vision compared to what we have now.  The reality is that Project Ireland 2040 is just a rehash and a repackaging of all the other plans and announcements we have had in the recent past.  When we consider regional development and we see how Dublin is grinding to a halt because of the lack of a national plan, I do not see the solutions to the crisis in any part of this plan.<\/p> <p> I shall give the example of metro north, the proposed route of which is located close to where I live.  I have lost count but I think this is at least the sixth time in 17 years that metro north has been announced as some part of the capital or strategic plan.  I remember when it was first announced.  It was around the time my daughter started primary school.  It was supposed to be finished by the time she started secondary school and I thought that would be great.  It would be nice to be able to go into town and it would only be 22 minutes from Swords.  My daughter is now in college in the Netherlands and she is never going to see that.  When I have visited my daughter in the Netherlands, the trains come at 42 minutes past the hour and they depart.  The next one is at 43 minutes past, or every 13 minutes.  They have an absolutely integrated and powerful transport system.  Metro north has been announced and announced, but nothing has been delivered.  We have to make this point because Ireland's record with capital projects is so abysmal that I honestly believe that if the plan had contained an announcement regarding the world's biggest skyscraper in Athlone or a space station in Killybegs, nobody would have batted an eyelid because we are so used to these plans being announced but nothing really happening afterwards.<\/p> <p> I remind the House that in 2005 the then Government published a ten-year plan for transport called Transport 21.  I read over that again, in preparation for this debate, and I do not know if I should laugh or cry.  Transport 21 said that metro north was supposed to be completed by 2012.  It is now 2018 and it has not even been designed yet.  That plan also proposed the joining of the Tallaght and Sandyford Luas lines in the city centre by 2008.  Also in 2008, we were supposed to have a Tallaght to Citywest Luas extension, a Cork commuter rail service to Midleton, an Ennis to Athenry rail line and - I am not making this up - a rail station in St. Stephen's Green that would be to Dublin what Grand Central Station is to New York.  All of these projects were to happen in 2008.  Transport 21 promised us a metro west to be operational by 2012, the Luas to be extended all the way to Bray, trains that would run from Dublin to Dunboyne and Navan and an Ennis to Knock rail service.  We were to have bold new DART services from the city centre to Hazelhatch in Kildare and Balbriggan on the northern line and in Maynooth.  All the Dublin rail lines that I have just mentioned were announced in the National Transport Authority's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 and yet here we have them again in this plan.  The main thing that all of these projects have in common is that none of them ever happened and that ground was not broken in respect of a single one.  Let us bear this in mind when we look at Project Ireland 2040.  It is a piece of paper.  I am not being negative but experience has taught us that a lot of what is proposed will not happen.  The maps with the proposed new rail lines for Dublin are the same maps that were in Transport 21, which was introduced 13 years ago.  We are told that there are capital commitments in this plan, but there were capital commitments in the last plan also.<\/p> <p> Where are we going with a lot of this?  We do not have the time to develop this further but we do have to put it into its absolute context because a lot of money has been expended, but nothing has really been delivered in many cases.  It was not just the Fine Gael-Labour Government; Fianna F&aacute;il, the Independent Alliance, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats were all in government when those plans were introduced.  In the context of metro north, nothing has been delivered.<\/p> <p> When I consider transport in the context of Project Ireland 2040, I come to the conclusion that the Government has given up entirely on the concept of sustainable regional transport in favour of roads, roads and more roads.  This is even as we head towards climate catastrophe.  National roads, ring roads, motorways and bypasses; we have them all.  They are all in this plan.  The 13 year old Transport 21, which was drawn up before the Paris Agreement on climate change, at least contained some plans for regional railways.  Project Ireland 2040 is very weak in that regard.  This is incredibly wrong and it is a backward step for sustainable transport.  The plan refers airily to supporting a sustainable and economically efficient agriculture sector but does not mention the fact that Food Wise 2025 and Food Harvest 2020 are both predicated on increasing agricultural output, with the attendant increase in carbon emissions.  Sustainable in this context really has nothing to do with climate and everything to do with profit.<\/p> <p> I am very concerned that Project Ireland 2040 refers, in excited terms, to data centres.  It refers to such centres as being international digital infrastructure.  However, it does not contain an explanation as to how we might mitigate against the humongous energy demands and emissions to which these centres will give rise.  We are informed that data centres will underpin Ireland's international position as a location for information and communication technology.  Let us get real: data centres are server warehouses and nothing more.  It is like saying that a warehouse containing car parts on the Longmile Road will underpin Ireland's position as a location for car manufacturing.  It is absolute and utter nonsense.  Data centres are not part of our silicon future.  They will actually place a huge drain on our natural energy resources.  At full capacity, the first phase of the Athenry plant will hoover up some 30 MW of power, the same amount needed for 26,000 homes.   Over time, this will rise to 240 MW.  This is just the requirements of one data centre.  It is absolutely frightening.  I do not have time to further develop the points but this plan is heavy on spin and light on detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100040#TT00400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519231500,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom a bheith dearfach ach t&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith deacair.

Tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais.  I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, this plan acknowledges that the previous spatial plan failed and that it did so for a number of reasons.  The plan acknowledges that we want to move away from development that is led by developers.  I really welcome this.  The plan acknowledges that the one which preceded it failed for a number of reasons including: a decentralisation programme that did not work; the absence of a statutory basis for the previous plan; and the fact that there were winners and losers.  This plan has no winners or losers.<\/p><p>It is difficult not to be cynical, particularly in view of the fact that the previous plan had no statutory basis and that this one also has no such basis.  I rarely find myself in agreement with Deputy Kelly but he made some valid points in respect of the new plan.  The manner of its publication last Friday beggars belief.  Although the additions are welcome, the changes in recent weeks clearly undermine the process that has been going on for three years.  That Members did not receive copies of the plan and were obliged to download it from the Internet tells a story about the Government's regard for the D&aacute;il and for new politics.  The most important aspect of all of this is that the plan comes in the wake of the Flood tribunal, which later became the Mahon tribunal.  I wish to quote paragraph 1.02 of that tribunal's report, which states:<\/p><blockquote>Throughout that period, [the 1980s to the 1990s] corruption in Irish political life was both endemic and systemic.  It affected every level of Government from some holders of top ministerial offices to some local councillors and its existence [corruption] was widely known and widely tolerated.<\/blockquote><p>I only have a few minutes remaining but I would say to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, that it is worth reading the rest of paragraph 1.02.<\/p><p>Paragraph 1.03 states:<\/p><blockquote>The Tribunal is aware that the corruption exposed by it, and by other Tribunals of Inquiry, has seriously undermined the public's faith in democracy and in particular, in its public officials, whether elected or appointed.<\/blockquote><p>On foot of the tribunal's report, we supposedly learned lessons.  We learned from the failure of the spatial strategy and we learned to plan for the future up to 2040.  It was a great learning period.  The Government then went ahead last Friday and published the plan, without a statutory basis and without discussion in the D&aacute;il.  This really does not help confidence.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Chomh maith leis sin, n&iacute;l c&oacute;ip Ghaeilge le f&aacute;il.

Again, the Government has failed, not miserably, but it has failed in its legal obligations to give us an Irish version at the very same time it gives us an English version.  As it is not underpinning this planning framework with legislation and is not complying with its existing obligations under legislation, it is very difficult to be positive.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding that, there are some good things in the plan in the area of long-term planning and in the emphasis on developing the other cities.  The plan names five cities - and I am happy to see they include Galway - to balance the unsustainable overdevelopment of Dublin.  I welcome that.  I also welcome the Government's statement that it will transition to a low-carbon and climate-resistant society and its many uses of the word \"sustainable\", which one of my colleagues has already mentioned.  It is a wonderful document in that way.  However, when one reads the small print, and my weekend and the last few days were spoiled by doing so, one sees a complete absence of vision, a move towards the privatisation of all our services and an utter failure to recognise the crisis we have in housing. <\/p> <p> In the chapter on Galway, one reads about problems with choice and affordability.  It is way beyond choice and affordability.  It is a major crisis in which 13,000 people are on a waiting list.  There is absolutely no recognition of that in the plan.  Public private partnerships are given a place of adoration.  I sit on the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General has repeatedly pointed out to us that, without allowing myself to exaggerate, there is a serious deficiency in the post-evaluation of public private partnerships after five years.  We are told one of the reasons for this is that so doing would reveal commercially sensitive information.  The Government is going further down the route of public private partnerships with absolutely no evaluation of whether they are good value for money.<\/p> <p> There is a very good point in the plan about building more than 50% of all future developments in Galway city on brownfield sites.  I absolutely welcome that.  We have Ceannt Station, the docks and other very important public lands.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, agreed with me the last day when I said that development in Galway is, as usual, developer-led.  Despite this lovely document, although he said he rarely agreed with me, he fully agreed with me when I talked about developer-led development in Galway without a master plan for our public lands.  That is what is happening.  By the time some of this plan is to be implemented, the public lands will have been compromised.  <\/p> <p> In addition, the Government is going down the route of selling off our public lands in respect of public housing.  The public housing provision the Government talks about is the provision of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  I have a fundamental problem with that.  The Government is artificially bolstering the market all the time with its housing policy.  On Galway, and to stick with the positive, the Government wants most development to happen within the city, which I welcome.  However, the same plan includes an outer ring road.  It is to cost up to &euro;600 million.  It must be most expensive road in the whole of the world at more than &euro;30 million per kilometre.  It will draw the development out, not in.  There is a complete mismatch in this policy.  There are many more things in the plan which I would love the opportunity to go into in a positive way because we only get one chance at building our vision for the future, but my time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100041#UU00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519232100,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Much of the fanfare surrounding the publication of Project Ireland 2040 has fallen flat.  That is because it is an insincere attempt by this Government to promote itself and has become, in effect, an extremely expensive publicity stunt.  While there has been a lot of commentary about moving away from local politics in the drafting of this national policy, I have no shame in stating the case for County Donegal or in stating I believe more should have been offered in the drafting of the national development plan.<\/p>  <p>  Donegal has persistently been sidelined in national policy and as a result suffers from chronic underinvestment and unbalanced regional growth.  Project Ireland 2040 calls itself futuristic because it sets out development in Ireland for the next generation.  The contents of Project Ireland 2040, however, are really projects which should have been carried out ten years ago, not in ten years' time.  We should be seeing this money within the next few years because we are so behind economically and in terms of infrastructure in this country thanks to the austerity policies pushed through by Fine Gael and Labour.  It is also an intensely commercially-led high-tech plan, which leaves little room for rural development or for projects which have a social value element to them.  What is evident in Project Ireland 2040 is that Donegal can expect to be forgotten for another generation thanks to the national development plan once again continuing the trend of excluding the needs of Donegal and rural Ireland from national policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been keeping its cards close to its chest in terms of specific county-by-county projects.  What I do see for County Donegal is really quite comical, particularly the commentary on the announcement of some projects in Donegal, namely, that Project Ireland 2040 will be a game-changer.  At least Donegal's situation is different from that of Dublin and Galway in respect of their railway developments because the plan announces projects for Donegal that have already started and that are almost finished.  At least we know we are getting these projects because they are nearly complete anyway.  <\/p>  <p>  This plan is anything but a game-changer for Donegal.  Most of the projects have already been announced and, in some cases, projects are being announced which are very near completion.  I have heard and read the figure of 179 being bandied about in terms of the number of projects in the plan which have previously been announced.  It is baffling to think the Government thought it could get away with promising future projects that are already nearing completion.  For example, the Donegal Bay sewage scheme servicing Bundoran, Killybegs and Glencolumbkille is approximately 90% complete but will be rolled out in this plan.  The N56 from Glenties to Lettermacaward is almost half complete, but it will also be rolled out under this plan.  The Ballybofey bypass has been on the cards for years and the announcement today does nothing to make it a reality.  The reference to radiology services for Letterkenny University Hospital actually relates to refurbishment money going back to the flooding in 2011.  On the State-owned harbour in my native town of Killybegs, &euro;5 million of the almost &euro;8 million which has been announced relates to previously announced works.  I have tabled a question to the Minister on this issue because it was recently announced in my constituency that Killybegs harbour was to receive nearly &euro;8 million when it appears that only &euro;3 million is actually new money and that the rest is tied up in contractual commitments going back a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  I must also laugh at the statement on broadband and the claim that the roll-out will be expedited.  Was this included in the draft plan prior to the scandal surrounding Eir pulling out of the tendering process?  If this is to be achieved the Government will have to play a lot of catch-up.  There is nowhere near the capacity to develop this process given the specific delays which the plan has experienced.  Are Departments even talking to each other?  This plan was only published on Friday and yet does not include any of that in it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is sending out a contradictory message here with large sums of money being allocated to road upgrades while the local authority has been rejecting applications for local improvement scheme payments across Donegal.  I have been holding a number of emergency clinics to help people to set up their appeals.  It would have been wise for the Government to have provided sufficient funding for the ongoing needs of road users at a local level as well as announcing grand projects.  Why I am talking about roads when everybody else in the country is talking about railways?  It is because we do not have any railways and never will.  We do not have roads and probably will not have roads in the future either.  On my 160-mile journey home from here, I drive on a motorway for 20 miles.  We will not have a railway.  We would love to have a railway.  Indeed, there was a railway station in my own town of Killybegs but it was closed in 1963.  The railway was abolished.  The whole county of Donegal was well served by the railway which was taken out by previous Governments.  We cannot expect to have any railway in the future.<\/p>  <p>  This brings me to another problematic aspect of Project Ireland 2040.  The plan is very top-heavy and primarily focuses on developing Letterkenny while the west and south west of the county remain largely absent.  Not only will this kind of development place a lot of emphasis on one urban centre, but it will ensure increasing population growth in Letterkenny, as people continue to migrate from rural villages, encouraging even more depopulation.  I spoke on the issue of depopulation already today with the Minister, Deputy Ring, who seemed to think that everything was fine and rosy in rural Ireland.  I highlighted the plague of depopulation in Donegal, which is experiencing the highest rate of depopulation in the country.  In fact, only two other counties have experienced depopulation, while the rest of the country has seen an increase in population.  That is because everybody is moving from Donegal to work in Dublin.  The  Minister made much of the fact that the live register in Donegal had declined by more than 9,000 in recent years.  He forgot to mention that only 2,000 jobs had been created despite the live register declining by 9,000.  That is because these people are living in Australia, England, America, Dublin and places like that. <\/p><p>It is also a myth that much more development can be carried out in Letterkenny.  Letterkenny is an absolute disaster in terms of planning and everything else.  It will not be able to take the population that would be there unless those issues are dealt with straight away.  The north west is heading in the opposite direction to the rest of the country.  Project Ireland 2040 will only entrench it further.  While it does contain a new rural regeneration fund of &euro;1 billion to support rural renewal and reduce population decline, it is very scant on detail.  It remains to be seen how much of this will be targeted at county level.  It will probably be announced in the next plan, 20 years from now.<\/p> <p> We should be seeing equal consideration for the development of urban centres and rural villages.  We need to provide funding and supports for rural villages to develop their own local economies, to bring in local employment and develop as sustainable, vibrant places to live.  Much of job creation will depend on broadband roll-out, of course, but in the meantime it is about accessing proper supports and structures that can reverse the population trend.  Ultimately, we need to see a reversal of the damaging Fine Gael policies and the legacy left behind by the Labour Party, which have encouraged the retreat of rural services.  The retreat of rural services is a blight on rural Ireland and has spread to the private sector too, as small towns like Ardara are now left with no banking facilities at all.  I have also been carrying out a business survey across Donegal, talking to businesses, who generally seem to be the only people the Government actually listens to.  The response has been very good so far but what is alarming from them is the level of anxiety regarding the continued trend of depopulation and the retreat of rural services.  Project Ireland 2040 was an opportunity for a targeted approach with both urban and rural aspects side by side in equal measure and in symbiosis, not in direct competition with each other.<\/p> <p> I would like to go on and talk about the cross-Border element and Brexit.  The document seems to suggest that Brexit is not happening, which is good news for all of us in Donegal because the only development in the plan for Donegal is cross-Border between Letterkenny and Derry.  Hopefully Brexit will not happen and that can go ahead.  It seems to be just a sop that was thrown in at the last minute to satisfy us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100042#VV00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519232700,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  I will take 20 minutes and Deputy Healy-Rae will take ten.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to be able to speak this evening on the wonderful aims and big announcements.  When I opened the national development plan and looked for references to Tipperary, I found just two instances despite it being the sixth largest county in the State.  One was on a map of Ireland and the other was on the Irish Bioeconomy Foundation in Tipperary.  That was it.  Last night when I looked through it again, on page 40 I saw a picture of four cail&iacute;n&iacute; in Clonmel a couple of years ago ag rince seit ar an tsr&aacute;id, on the street.  As my daughter was included in the picture as well, I had better declare that in case they say I have an interest and did not declare it.<\/p>  <p>  Things were slightly better when I researched the national planning framework document and found 16 references to Tipperary.  However, four were simply for photos and another one was a reference to Tipperary on a map of Ireland.  The rest of the references mainly referred to the excellent work of Tipperary Energy Agency, which is internationally recognised and I recognise that myself.  It is leading research and delivering community initiatives such as SuperHomes, Better Energy Communities, Insulate Tipp etc.  I salute them and the work they do and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, as well.  Tipperary is home to Cloughjordan ecovillage and Templederry community wind farm, which I 100% support.<\/p>  <p>  There are some positives.  As part of the capital investment plan, South Tipperary General Hospital, which was formerly known as St. Joseph's - I still affectionately call it St. Joseph's although somebody decided to change it - received &euro;3.2 million for the provision of a new outpatient clinic.  The total investment in South Tipperary General Hospital amounts to just under &euro;50 million but again this has been announced and re-announced and recycled.<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future and 2040, Tipperary County Council in a submission to the national planning framework developed several key strategic aims that included strong prosperous towns which are vibrant and viable, economically self-sufficient and quality places to live and work.  That is not happening.  Our towns are being denuded.  We saw it today when my colleague, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae found that only three towns in County Kerry can even avail of grants for the upgrading of semi-derelict houses to house people.  He was told by the Minister of State's boss, the Taoiseach, that it was not true but it is what we are being told on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot of spin coming out of Government Buildings, especially with the Taoiseach's new &euro;5 million spinning machine.  The document refers to revitalised attractive villages providing local services and employment opportunities for sectors of the community.  That is just literally aspirational.  We all know the villages.  They are dying on their feet.  The Government will not allow any development and many of them have not got sewerage schemes, as was also advanced today by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  I refer to \"A county which is delivering effective regional development through co-operation and collaboration with its partners in the Southern Region.\"  Finally, there is reference to \"a connected county with excellent strategic, road and rail infrastructure.\"  I am sorry for laughing but I have to laugh.  The people who wrote this must have never left Dublin 4.  As Deputy Pringle just said and as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said himself, this is just d&oacute;chas at best.  Unfortunately however, there is almost next to nothing in Project Ireland 2040 that will escalate the delivery of all those aims.  Indeed if Tipperary does benefit through either of the two strands, the national planning framework, NPF, or the national development plan, NDP, it will almost be by accident rather than by design.<\/p>  <p>  I have to stray a small bit with the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I was in here for nine minutes this evening to hear the contribution of the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, or AK47 as we used to call him.  I heard him and heard the double standards, after the ruin he brought on our country with his Labour Party in the last Government, and then he has the cheek to attack this for not having been voted through.  It was not voted through here, he is right there, but neither was the decision to abolish town councils and borough district councils.  That was not voted through either, there was no vote on it in this House and he was a senior Minister in government that time.  For him now to be latching on to this to try and reincarnate himself as some kind of a saviour of rural Ireland is just sickening to the people of Tipperary who I represent.<\/p>  <p>  The national planning framework, we are told, aims to bring about balanced regional development with an expectation that the capital's economic dominance and expansion will grow at a slower rate in the next few years.  Then there is the national development plan, which is to be rolled out over the course of ten years at a cost of &euro;115 billion and which is aimed at upgrading State infrastructure.  The public, and particularly the people of Tipperary will be forgiven for being sceptical about all of this.  Why would we not be sceptical?  Has the Government forgotten that we have already had almost six years of national and regional jobs strategies?  What has come of these for rural Ireland in particular?  Has the Government forgotten that so much of what it promised and announced in the national development plan was already announced in the plan to revitalise rural Ireland about which we have heard so much in recent times?<\/p>  <p>  When the former Taoiseach, God be good to him and he is here with us and still alive, thank God, went out to Edgeworthstown - \"The Four Roads to Glenamaddy\" I called it - what he was not going to do?  It was all on paper and spin but no delivery of anything with the country falling down around him still and it continued to fall down around him.<\/p>  <p>  What about the national broadband plan?  Where is that?  We have more roll-outs than we have hot dinners and still nothing for rural Ireland.  This project alone, if it fails to be rolled out quickly, will rapidly and decisively undermine any plans for industrial or commercial development in rural counties.  We had the harsh weather last week with the bit of snow that is gone but is supposed to come back tonight and disappear again tomorrow.  This this plan will be the same.  The first ray of sunshine will melt it because anyone who wants to dig down and investigate it will know it as a combination of former things that were already announced, spin and regurgitation and an effort for Fine Gael to launch its election manifesto.<\/p>  <p>  I wonder where the Independent Alliance is.  It does not seem to be anywhere in this.  All the Minister, Deputy Ross, is concerned about is locking up the people of rural Ireland if they allow their L-plate drivers go out on the road or cross the yard with a tractor or anything else.  While I welcome the fact that roads like the M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick will be built at the cost of &euro;900 million, I need to inform the Minister that quite recently the chief executive of Tipperary County Council, Joe MacGrath, estimated that it would take &euro;190 million just to repair and maintain the roads in much of Tipperary.  Where are we going with &euro;900 million for this road from Cork?  Again the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was on an early morning raid.  He would have been great in the time of the Troubles if he was around, because of his dawn raids that he makes all the time.  He went to Cork and announced this road prematurely.  When I took up the phone to ring the Minister, Deputy Ross, several months ago now, it was the first he had heard of it and there was no money for it.  What is going on?  They are playing politics with the life and future of our country.  We had a proposition on the table for the Limerick to Waterford route, Limerick to Cahir in the first aspect of it, which would bypass Pallasgreen.<\/p><p>There was a compulsory purchase order, CPO, made on the Pallasgreen to Cahir route, and a design was drawn up.  We would also have a bypass of the chronic situation in Tipperary town.  One cannot walk the streets.  The streets cannot be repaired; nothing can be done with them.  We need that bypass.  The town is stifled and it is being stagnated further by this severe rejection of the proposals to bring the road from Limerick to Cahir.  I have nothing against the Limerick to Cork motorway but Limerick to Cahir was &euro;380 million cheaper.  It adds 18 to 20 minutes to the journey, but we wanted an M8 junction in Cahir, which is the crossroads of Munster.  The motorway to Dublin and the M8 motorway to Cork are totally underutlised.  The proposal made perfect sense, but politically it was not okay for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and other people from Cork.  They are now insisting that there is no money, even for preliminary investigations or studies to be carried out.<br\/><br\/>Limerick to Cork sounded good and it looked good.  It was announced in Cork first and then the Ministers went to Sligo to announce this one.  They went to Sligo just to give the impression that it was not a Dublin-centric plan.  It is Dublin-centric.  Everything goes to Dublin.  I contend - my colleague made the same point last night - that there are too many public service vehicles in Dublin.  There is no room for any more.  New Luas units are being built and more have been ordered but they cannot cross O'Connell Bridge.  They do not fit, and they block the buses and the bicycles and everything else.  There are too many buses already.  More momentum should be put into green energy and into electric.  There are taxis, many of which are private, and I salute them for the efforts they are trying to make.  There are Luas, DART and rail services.  I am not begrudging one thing Dublin has but it is oversupplied and different transport modes are in one another's way because of bad planning.  <br\/><br\/>There have been enormous efforts to starve the rest of the country and give everything to the capital.  Successive reports from the OECD and many other sources have stated that 53% or 54% of our national economic activity is inside the Pale.  That is about 20% higher than any other European capital.  There is bedlam in Dublin.  One cannot get a bed or get office space - although I know more office space is being built - but above all people cannot get houses.  We also do not have a functioning transport system.  It takes me three hours to get out of here of an evening, if I leave after 3 p.m., to get down below Naas.  Everything is happening here.  There is a sense of madness.  The cranes are up again.  When we walk out of Leinster House tonight and look up it is nice to see them.  They are not building houses.  We saw what the last boom brought us.  It brought us bedlam and a total crash and bang.  It was boasted that there were more cranes in Dublin than in London.  Where did it get us?  A heap of brus on the floor like a heap of kippins that would not even burn in the fire.<b><\/b>It has caused tragedy and devastation in people's lives.  <br\/><br\/>The results are now clear.  The Government will not face the vulture funds and take them on.  It will not stand with the people who want to house themselves, people who did nothing wrong to anyone.  People wanted to get planning permission, to save their wages and get loans so that they could build houses for themselves.  We have now been told that Tipperary will have a cap of 480 new houses.  To hell with the people.  I said earlier that former Ministers Kelly and Hogan did more damage to rural Ireland than Cromwell did.  To hell or to Connacht, it was said.  We cannot even go to Connacht any more because there is no train route to it.  <br\/><br\/>I am disappointed that no senior Minister is in the House tonight to listen to this.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee.  The Ministers do not want to listen to it.  I am disappointed that they cannot face the people.  There was no meaningful debate.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, had a presentation in the audiovisual room in 2016 where he committed to coming in to the House to have a full debate on the issue and said that it would have to be passed by the Oireachtas.  He is flouting his responsibilities to the people.  The people gave the Government a severe wallop, as iar-Taoiseach Kenny called it, the last time.  Why would they not?  The Government thought the people were irrelevant and thought it could manage without them.  They were fed on a diet of liberal legislation for five years - the Labour Party included.  I warned Labour about what would happen to it.  I said that it would come back in a car and it came back in a seven-seater.  Deputy Kelly then sought the leadership and he could not get anyone to second him.  That is the sort of confidence people have in him and he expects the people of Tipperary to have it in him now, despite the ruin he brought on rural Ireland with all the different legislation he brought in concerning the tyres on cars etc.  I believe there were funny stories behind that.  He announced houses all over the county.  I am like a bad record, but he would not build a hen house in Kinvara or a dog-shed in Carrick-on-Suir.  He would only talk about it.  Eleven houses were built in Tipperary by the council in the years 2011 to 2016.  That is one and a half houses per year, after all his talk.  He is now going around the country holding meetings with other Deputies, trying to reincarnate himself and act as the saviour of rural Ireland.  However, the people of rural Ireland are educated and they are smart and intelligent.  All they want to do is to live and be let live and not to be banished from the roads by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his regressive legislation.  <br\/><br\/>I wondered what kind of water the Cabinet was drinking the other day when it came out and said that any person who lets a learner driver drive unaccompanied would be penalised.  I have children myself, as do many Deputies here.  All have full licences except for one, who is not on the road yet.  Perhaps people cannot afford two cars or perhaps one partner cannot drive.  People will have to leave work to come home to drive to college with their sons or daughters.  The Government wants us all to be at home, dossing and mooching around.  The former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, said that they all had big screens and mobile phones.  She got her answer for that.  The Government will get its answer too.  The people are waiting for it.  They are not putting up with all of this regressive legislation, none of which is rural-proofed.  <br\/><br\/>The Government announced this grandiose plan in a spin of glory in an attempt to win more popularity for the Taoiseach.  I met the head of the IDA last year in Washington, who told me that he cannot get a company to invest anywhere outside of Dublin now.  That is an issue the Government should be dealing with.  He told that to the Taoiseach as well; he met him an hour before I met him.  In Washington in 2004 I was told the same thing.  Companies will not locate in rural Ireland because everything has been invested in Dublin.  The people of rural Ireland do not want anything from the Government only to be let live.  They want to be the job creators and to be allowed to provide for their families and build houses for them.  However, these people cannot get planning.  I have met dozens of couples who have sites and the wherewithal to build a house but who cannot get planning.  There is every reason in the world to give these people planning.  I have heard former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, talking about urban sprawl.  That is not the panacea.  Our clubs, schools, churches and people need to exist in rural Ireland.  People were hunted out of it and starved out of it during the Famine, and this something similar.  People are being driven out of rural Ireland now and are being persecuted for living there.  <br\/><br\/>Repairs to the roads in Tipperary will cost an estimated &euro;200 million.  We cannot get this money.  We cannot get money for rural social schemes or the new community or local involvement schemes which were announced last November.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, was a great man then.  What has he been doing?  We cannot get money from the Leader programme.  We had the best Leader programme in Europe, which was held up all over the world as a model.  Big Phil the destroyer, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, destroyed it because, he said, he wanted to give power to the Fine Gael councils.  I heard him saying it at different times.  This approach was supported by Deputy Kelly.  It ruined Leader.  The Government has been trying to restart the programme for the past three years and barely a penny has been given out so far, perhaps &euro;30 million from a &euro;400 million programme.  That &euro;400 million itself represents a drop from well over &euro;1.4 billion in the last Leader programme.  The money was given out to local improvement schemes.  I have no problem with a portion of it being given out to that end, but that money was supposed to support community projects and private entrepreneurs who wanted to develop rural Ireland.  Instead, that money was raided.  The same Minister, was also tasked with looking after the post offices.  I made the point in here - it was around Holy Thursday - that it was like Pontius Pilate, the way he washed his hands of the post offices and handed them over to Deputy Naughten.  He did not want the poisoned chalice of the post offices.  He was not interested in supporting the post offices. <br\/><br\/>We have presented projects in here and demonstrated different models, such as the German model and the New Zealand model as seen with Kiwibank, among others, which showed that banking could be handled by post offices.  This is being resisted because the Government is in bed with the banks.  The Government refuses to pass legislation to deal with the vulture funds.  The banks now want to offload their dirty work onto vulture funds.  The Government is saying that it is not happening.  However, I have had people ringing me - and I am sure the Minister of State has had people ringing her too - who are with Permanent TSB and who have made settlements, but part of the money is parked and they are paying away as best they can.  These people are now terrified.  They are sick and worried about the vulture funds.  These vulture funds are nameless and shameless.  They will not come before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, to account for themselves.  This book of 20,000 loans represents families.  The Government thinks we are talking about a commodity, like cattle at a mart.  We are talking about human lives.  How many suicides have we had?  How many families and marriages have been devastated by this?  It has caused pressure and sickness.  People feel they are unable to look after their families because of the pressure from the banks.  Marauding thugs - I call them the third force - are going out and beating up fathers and sons on the side of the road and seizing machinery and everything else.  I have brought this issue up on the floor of this Chamber.  This is happening; I am not living in dreamland.  The banks can do what they like.  The cabals organised a couple of court cases and had people in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions shredding some files and burning others.  It would not happen in the Congo.  What is going on here would not happen in a Third World country.  It is going on here with impunity under the Government's watch.  All it can come up with is this 140-page, raggle-taggle plan.<\/p><p>Some 170 projects have been announced already, a number of them two and three times over, and more of them have been cobbled together.  If we are paying the spin doctors and senior civil servants to cobble all of this together at the behest of their masters, it is a sad reflection on what our country has come to in 2018, two years after celebrating the centenary of the 1916 martyrs and the people who gave us our freedom.<\/p> <p> In the same way, I keep asking the Minister, Deputy Naughten, about the post offices.  We meet him every two weeks.  We lost 33 postmen in Tipperary.  I believe 180 had to be let go across the country, and there are 1,000 people working in the GPO.  I presume some of them are working hard but there is dead weight there also, and the unions have to answer for keeping them in there.  Each time there is a cut, it is the ordinary bean an phoist and fear an phoist in the oifig an phoist who are amach ar an mb&oacute;thar.  They are the ordinary people who are penalised and cut all the time.  The Government view is that we must trim all of them but not touch the dead weight inside the centre of the department in the GPO.  There are more people working in the GPO now than when Padraig Pearse was there, but what the hell are they doing?  They should get out and do meaningful work and allow the ordinary post offices have a banking service.  Give them the motor taxation service.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has moved to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I asked the Minister, Deputy Ross, months ago to allow the post offices offer a motor taxation service.  He thought I was pulling a fast one or that something shady was going on, but he should allow the post offices to do motor taxation as they are ready, willing and able to do it.  <\/p> <p> We should allow the county housing officials to do the work they want to do on housing.  They are crying out for staff.  They should move over to there.  I have nothing against council officials good, bad or indifferent.  I have worked in a motor tax office and every place else.  All I am asking of the Minister of State is to be real with the people.  Stand up and face them and say, \"Look, we are in this together\".  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Bring back the meitheal philosophy.  We do not want spin and jocose announcements of projects we know we will never see, projects that have been announced several times previously.  People are too smart for that.<\/p> <p> I ask the media to drill down on this and expose it for what it is, namely, a fraud and a misplaced plan being perpetrated on the people of Ireland.  However, the people are a smart and educated electorate, and they will be waiting on the Government again.  I told the Government they were waiting in the long grass the previous time.  They were, and they will wait again.  They will come out and go into the ballot box with the peann luaidhe, the little pencil, and there will be no spin machine for the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  Nothing will penetrate the ballot box and they will put uimhir a haon, uimhir a naoi or maybe uimhir a deich on the ballot paper and he will get his answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100043#WW00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519233900,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about this proposed plan, and I hope it is only a proposed plan.  First, anything I say to the Minister of State is not personal; it is purely based on the plan and its architects.  We were told that the purpose of this plan was to take people out of Dublin and build up the rural part of the country.  We were told also that it would benefit cities such as Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway but, as I see it, this is another Dublin plan.  There is very little in it for any other part of the country.  I will read it again, but I did not see Kerry mentioned in the plan once.  That is what we have to put up with.  The people of Kerry and the people of rural Ireland are entitled to live the best way they can and where they want to live.  No one can make them live anywhere else against their will.<\/p>  <p>  It is hard to highlight everything in the plan but there are different proposals and strategies in it.  Page 92 refers to the location of homes.  It states that future homes are required to be located where people have the best opportunities to access a high standard quality of life.  It further states that they are to be located in places that can support sustainable development.  Where are those places?  It further states that places which support growth, innovation and the efficient provision of infrastructure and are accessible to a range of local services can encourage the use of public transport, walking, cycling and help tackle climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The plan also refers to requirements to live in our cities and larger towns.  We have to be very careful when we see this because planners will be told how to interpret it.  It refers to areas where large-scale housing demand exists and where homes and appropriate supporting services can be delivered more efficiently and effectively at less cost to the State in the long run and still be located in our smaller towns, villages and rural areas including the countryside, but at an appropriate scale, that does not detract from the capacity of our larger towns and cities to deliver homes more sustainably.  We are keeping our ear to the ground and we have been told that the new plan will direct local authorities to suggest that one-off houses cannot be built in rural areas other than when and where towns and villages are sufficiently built up.  When will that happen?  That is the trouble.<\/p>  <p>  John Moran had a role in the Central Bank.  It is no wonder the country went the way it did.

They complained about 500,000 one-off houses being built around the country.  I want to say to those people that all those houses had to go through the rigorous planning process before planning permission was granted.  They had to comply with site assessment and septic tank requirements.  They could not be obtrusive in terms of the countryside, they had to have the required sight distance going out on roads, and, by and large, they had to be connected to the area in which they wanted to build.  Those people did nothing wrong when they put a roof over their own heads.  If the Government is proposing to stop people doing that, there will be crowds outside the gate of these Houses.  They have been there in the past but there will be a bigger crowd outside the gate if it tries to do something like that to people who are not doing any harm.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot of talk here about the need for local authorities to build houses for homeless people.  That has to be done in certain cases, but where people can and want to build a house in which to bring up their families the way they want to and not have to experience the social problems they may experience if they were in more built-up areas, I cannot see anything wrong with that.  These people are saying there will have to be a financial need for them to be allowed build a house in a rural area.  That is totally wrong and is the height of blackguarding because most people in rural Ireland are trying to live the best way they can off their bit of land, but they have to travel to work and I do not see anything wrong with that.<\/p>  <p>  They are saying that these people are costing the State in terms of infrastructure.  Most of them have their own septic tanks and no one should tell me that the roads have to be maintained for them.  Those are the same roads used since the time of the horse and carts in the 1800s.  We battled to get them resurfaced, so surely they are entitled to that.  What about the urban cost?  There is no talk about that.  All we hear is the burden rural Ireland is on the State.

That this plan will be sacrosanct and statutory and that it may be impossible to add anything or take it away if it is wrong is against my principles.  Climate change is going to cost &euro;22 billion or at least &euro;22 billion will be provided for it.  Who will provide that?  It will, of course, be the people.  At that rate of going, it will cost &euro;1 billion a year to comply.  We are told we will not be allowed to cut turf by 2030.  The words used were to the effect that we cannot burn peat.  We were told we would be better off to leave the turf in the bog but a lot of people in Gneevgullia, Kilcummin, Kilgarvan, Caherciveen, Killorglin and all the areas in between would be very cold if they were not allowed go to the bog, cut their turf and bring it home.

I was very critical when that did not happen with the launch of the national spatial strategy.  However, the way this plan has been developed will come back to haunt the Government.  Early last year, the process was opened to submissions, but it was a one-way consultation.  Until the plan was published, it was not obvious what, if anything, had been taken on board from those submissions.  The plan should also have been launched in this Parliament.  The Government is, after all, a minority one, but it has decided it has a monopoly on wisdom.  That is outrageous.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential that any national development framework is focused, evidence-based and takes account of the current environment, which, in this case, requires a transition between the national spatial strategy and the national development plan.  It is not just that on day 1 we finish with the former and move on.  The core strategy, we are told, is to develop a counterbalance to Dublin, by which is meant the greater Dublin area including counties Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and even further afield.  We are to understand that the city cores of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, together with Athlone are to be the counterbalance to Dublin.  In ten years' time will the number of locations chosen be a matter of regret given the risk that funds are being spread too thinly?  What evidence was used to determine the number of priority locations?<\/p>  <p>  The national planning framework will replace the national spatial strategy, which has informed development over the last 20 years.  It is still informing development with sizable amounts of land being rezoned as we speak.  Last May, I was told in a reply from the Minister of State, Deputy English, that the national planning framework would be the top level plan informing in turn the new regional and economic strategies.  The regional strategies will replace the current regional planning guidelines.  If those strategies are being developed, it would have been useful to have them included in a plan rather than to dictate from the top down.  After all, if people are committed to something or an area is committed to something, there is a better chance of driving it.  Responsibility needs to be taken in those particular areas.  I was told in January 2017 in a reply from the then-Minister, Deputy Coveney, that his Department received a report in 2011 from the regional authorities which showed that prior to the introduction of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, there were 41,788 ha of land in total zoned for housing sufficient for the provision of 1.1 million new homes or an additional population of 2.64 million.  Some of that land was inappropriate locations and poorly serviced.  The instruction was to scale back the amount of zoned land to 11,000 ha or land sufficient to provide 300,000 new dwellings.  That would equate to approximately 12 years' supply.  The same reply stated in respect of major metropolitan areas where housing demand is most acute that the existing round of regional planning guidelines continued to provide a reasonable basis for planning growth and housing provision.<\/p>  <p>  I note my own experience in Kildare where the county development plan was adopted in 2017 to run to 2023.  The plan provides for an increase of 33,500 new housing units by 2022.  If one assumes 2.5 persons per household, it is a population increase of over 80,000.  The same type of development will be focused on Meath, Wicklow, Fingal and south Dublin.  It is all greenfield development.  If the local authorities refuse to comply with the regional planning guidelines as they are in place at the moment, it is open to the Minister to issue directions.  Indeed, that is happening.  We have a scenario, therefore, in which the Minister is publishing a national planning framework while ignoring the fact that huge tracts of land are currently zoned for housing under the national spatial strategy, which has a different core strategy.  There is no transitional arrangement to tie the two together or to provide a capital plan to meet the needs of the currently zoned lands.  This is not going to work.  We need to know how much land remains zoned and whether it is to be carried over to the national planning framework.  We need to know where that land is located.  I would have expected to see that detail in any national planning framework.  Last Friday, 16 February, the day the national planning framework was launched, did not represent a great new dawn on which the planning ship sailed off in a completely new direction.  The plan is sailing off in half a dozen different directions.  This is a big cargo ship, if Deputies can imagine that, and it will take time to turn it.  If one is dragging behind a legacy of commitments to zoned land which have not been calculated for and which are based on a different strategy, I do not see how that can work.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth looking at what happened in what is termed the \"greater Dublin area\" between 1996 and 2016.  That is a 20-year horizon like the one we are looking at now.  I use those years as those were the years on which there was a census of population.  The centre core of Dublin city grew by 13% while Dun Laoghaire grew by 13%.  Fingal grew by 43% and has doubled its population, not that one would notice it from the infrastructure and facilities in place there.  South Dublin grew by 22%, Kildare grew by 39%, Meath by 44% and Wicklow by 28%.  Most of what has happened has happened on the arc outside the M50.<\/p><p>The laughable thing is that people say nothing happens outside the M50.  I can tell them that a lot of houses were developed outside the M50.  What is going to occur is that these areas will continue to grow at least at the same rate for the next decade, so announcing a shiny new plan will change nothing on its own.  The absence of key public transport initiatives will make the congestion we see in Dublin city centre today look tame.  The key priority in regard to tying in what has happened already to the development of the city centre should have been DART underground, which should have been the number one public transport initiative.  We need this 7.6 km tunnel to pull together the rail network but, of course, that is postponed.<\/p> <p> The profile of development of other cities, such as Cork, Limerick and Waterford, has followed the same pattern of development in the past 20 years, with the real development in the suburbs rather than the core.  Galway has bucked that trend but transport infrastructure has not kept pace and congestion is a real issue that needs to be addressed if that city is to achieve the kind of sustainable living that it requires, and which would make it a really attractive location.  Better regional balance will only be achieved by initially focusing on a small number of areas as the primary drivers of such a strategy.  If limited resources are stretched too thin, then what will occur is a delay in providing a counter-balance, possibly by decades.  I am in favour of better regional balance, which I think its good on a number of fronts, for example, in regard to congestion, housing and increased job prospects due to having a significant population base.<\/p> <p> Within the plan we saw a long list of projects and some general aspirations.  There are many diagrams that appear to connect things up but when we try to drill down, it gives a very different picture.  A lot of decoding of language is needed.  For example, we are told social housing will be provided for 112,000 families in the next decade in a bid to address the housing crisis.  That sounds great but when one starts to drill down into those numbers in the context of the &euro;6 billion for social housing, which is very welcome, we would have to build those 112,000 homes for &euro;100,000 each.  The language used is to \"provide\" 112,000 homes but it does not mean to build them.  Decoding is needed.<\/p> <p> With regard to the Cork-Limerick motorway, the key ingredient for a PPP is that it has to stack up financially.  Typically, if it is a road, there has to be sufficient traffic to collect significant tolls.  Indeed, toll roads have been developed that did not reach the threshold and the contract meant the Exchequer had to pay compensation to the operator.  The Cork-Limerick motorway is likely to be a case in point.  Its specification is to motorway standard but this is because there will be less access on and off, so there is the possibility of tolling it.  It is very easy to predict that is what will happen.<\/p> <p> We were told by the chairperson-designate at Transport Infrastructure Ireland this morning that he understood the 2011 census was used to inform this plan, not the 2016 census.  Given I had a different response on that in reply to a parliamentary question I asked last year, the Minister should clarify which census was used.<\/p> <p> The new &euro;3 billion urban regeneration fund is heavily dependent on the private sector, with 100% matching funding required, which is likely to benefit stronger areas as opposed to weaker areas.  We see that all new State agencies must be located outside of Dublin.  This reminds me of Charlie McCreevy's decentralisation programme.  Real decentralisation would mean decentralisation of decision making, not this kind of sop to give the impression that something is happening.  If we are to have regional economic and spatial plans, there has to be the means for local decision making rather than having that determined for particular regions.<\/p> <p> The big bash in Sligo to announce this plan was a real slap in the face for democracy.  The Government does not have a majority mandate; it is quite a small Government of 58 Deputies out of 158.  While submissions were sought for this plan and were published, it is not obvious they were taken on board.  We should have had a mature engagement in regard to spending money wisely - an honest engagement on how money is collected and where it is spent - because a lot of nonsense is talked and I heard some of it talked here today.  For someone who is passionate about strategic planning to the point that I was talking to myself for years on this, I feel this plan really lets down the term \"strategic planning\".  It is a big disappointment from the point of view of how it was progressed; it is a real missed opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100046#ZZ00700","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519235100,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I was very hopeful and supportive of the process in terms of the national planning framework and aligning that with the national capital plan.  I would have gone further and put our national climate mitigation plan together with those because I think all three should be connected.  However, I have been very disheartened in the last five or six months.  I was very disappointed with the draft plan when it was published before Christmas and I am even more disappointed now.<\/p><p>The plan started with the right key aspirations.  First, all the documents and all the talk were exactly right in that the key mission was to try to switch away from the sprawling development seen across our State towards more compact settlements where people live close to their work and schools, and there is a real reduction in the cost of providing public services and quality of life for people.  Second, this would be part of the transition to a low-carbon society which we know we have to make but at which we are failing terribly.  This plan would give us a real opportunity, if we were to only grasp it instead of shying away from it, as we are at present.  Third, it would provide a chance to have proper balanced regional development, not the madcap decentralisation approach that Charlie McCreevy took in the early parts of the last decade, but a real way of bringing life back into the centres of Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford as a way of counterbalancing the continued growth of Dublin.  Last but not least, there would be the development of greater engagement by local authorities and regional authorities in this process in terms of how we prioritise projects, how we spend money and so on.<\/p><p>It is such an extensive document it would take more than the 12 minutes I have to address it properly but I want to set out some examples of where I think we have got it wrong in the final six months and, in particular, in the final document.  I want to cite a couple of commentators who have spoken about this because I happen to agree with their analyses.  I will start with John Moran, the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  While I am not quoting him directly, I think he got it absolutely right in an article in last Sunday's newspapers that this was a compromised document.  He said it was just protecting the <i>status quo<\/i>and that those behind it were not willing to be brave or to really think radically in terms of where we need to go from here.<\/p><p>Second, I want to quote Edgar Morgenroth of Dublin City University, who I believe was involved in the early stages of this plan.  He makes the very valid case that by the continued overspending on new roads development and inter-urban motorways, we are not actually going to deliver the stated objective of building up urban cores.  It simply does not work.  What it does is to continue the doughnut tendency which we have seen in all of those graphic maps from ten or 20 years ago that show the number of people who are commuting long distances - the 250,000 people the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, referred to in his speech in the House, who are spending more than two hours a day on their commute and travelling 30 to 60 miles to our cities.  That has to stop but it is not stopping.  It is going to continue because we have compromised it by just investing in roads and by again, at the last minute, saying people can keep going with one-off housing, live in a house 30 or 40 miles out in the country and commute into the city every day.  That is still where we are going.  The figures are stark.  Some 60% of the 500,000 houses we are expecting to build are to be outside the existing centres, either in greenfield, edge of town or edge of city sites, or further afield.  However, they are expensive to develop and they are not achieving the key objective, which is to bring urban life back to the core.<\/p><p>When it comes to urban cores, the metro is welcome, although it is very late.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It should have been commissioned in 2011 when it had planning permission and European Investment Bank funding and would have been the perfect counter-cyclical project.  I am glad that it is being varied to include the connection to the south side, as was always the intention.  However it is ten years late and it is not enough on its own.  Dublin is in a transport crisis and it will only get worse as traffic continues to grow by 5% annually.  The failure to advance the DART interconnector with any urgency, detailed planning or financial backing is a historic blunder.  That project connects all the old railway lines.  We have been looking for it since 1972 and recognised it was critical for an integrated public transport system.  This Government has blown that opportunity.  It is a terrible historic failing.Similarly, today, as Deputy Catherine Murphy noted, Transport Infrastructure Ireland was before the committee on transport.  TII told us it had loads of road projects which were ready to go to tender.  It is raring to go with all sorts of public private partnership roads.  Members of IBEC are licking their lips for the public private partnership benefits that will go to them.  This is a model we know well where certain road construction companies will do really well from this plan.  Is there a single public transport rail project ready to go to tender?  Not on your nelly, there is not.  Nor is there any sign of any of the projects such as bus rapid transit or other bus connect projects, not only in Dublin but also in Cork, Galway, Limerick or Waterford.  There is nothing.  We seem to have an impassable inability to deliver public transport projects when we need them most.  This plan does not favour those plans in the way it should if it wished to achieve the objectives that it set out at the beginning.  <br\/><br\/>There was a Minister parading around talking about spending &euro;58 million on greenways.  That will probably get us the Dublin to Galway greenway if only we could get over the objections.  The critical cycling infrastructure needed in Dublin today, the Sutton to Sandycove cycle route, or Bray to Balbriggan which is what we ought to be thinking of, the Liffey cycle route, the Dodder greenway, the Royal and Grand Canals, the Santry greenway are all projects that would achieve the objectives of creating really good compact living spaces.  There is no impetus behind it.  There is no support or priority given to it.<br\/><br\/>When it comes to the car-based system there is a need to think radically about where the trends are in cities that work.  They are not going towards car ownership, but car sharing and innovative technological solutions that will bring us away from this car-based system.  Fine Gael is just going with the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It is the old thing where people have a three-bed semi and a car and have to drive for three or four hours each day, stuck in traffic in and out, because there is no way it will work.  The Government could widen the N7 between Naas and Dublin to a 20-lane highway and it would still hit a standstill at the Red Cow.  It will still jam as it is jamming today. <br\/><br\/>The Government is not developing compact cities and is not prioritising compact development.  Nor is it sufficiently ambitious on low-carbon development.  Paul Kenny from the Tipperary Energy Agency made a simple point to a committee here recently.  He said that 60% of houses being built today are being built with fossil fuel heating systems.  It is crazy.  In 10 or 20 years' time they will have to be retrofitted at real cost.  We have the alternative technologies in heat pumps which would help balance our renewable energy supply.  We should move to that at a switch because that is where the world is going.  The balancing capability with electric vehicles, heat pumps, and renewable power provides us with competitive play.  We could already be doing it if we just said that we would stop burning fossil fuels.  <br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach is out in Strasbourg acting as though he has nothing to do with how we are a terrible climate laggard.  We are but if the Taoiseach meant to change it, the Government could make an immediate change to the big regulations to prohibit fossil fuels.  If the Government was serious about climate change it would not countenance more fossil fuel power stations.  We need to shut down Moneypoint and the peat-fired power stations.  We cannot replace them with gas or fossil fuels and certainly not biomass, which is the least sustainable option of all.  We have the potential.  It sounds great to say that we have 3.5 GW of additional renewable power but we should do that in the Irish Sea alone.  We should do an additional 2 GW of solar power and we should look to use Moneypoint as the connection point for offshore wind in the Atlantic which is now technologically and economically feasible.  That is what is happening in other countries now, that is what they are investing in but we are not.  We do not have the low-carbon ambition that we need to get us out of the laggard category and into the leadership one.  <br\/><br\/>The thing which disappoints me most, and I think I have said it at every point of consultation or other process, is that this plan should have been a land-use plan to go with the national planning framework.  We should look at 20,000 ha of forestry each year, not just the Sitka spruce monoculture clear-felling system.  We should go towards a system using alder, rowan, ash and other indigenous forestry which we pay farmers for.  It will help with climate, through the carbon store, and the money could go to the county where the tree is grown, but also protect biodiversity and creating a really wild Atlantic Way, which will cause floods of tourists to come here because it will be an attractive environment to visit.  There is none of that ambition.  The land-use plan is needed to go from the mountains to the sea so that we would manage our flooding system, our carbon storage and stop digging up peat which is the most valuable of carbon storage that we have, but there is none of that.  How can we have a planning framework that does not plan our land?  It is a terrible failing and a gap in this report.<br\/><br\/>On regional development, it is true that we need to develop Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Sligo and Letterkenny but we need to develop them in conjunction with Derry and think on an all-island basis.  Similarly, we need to consider the corridor through Louth in terms of a Dublin-Belfast corridor.  That level of strategic thinking is not evident here to compete against the northern corridor which the British Government is developing in the north of England.  This plan fails where at the last minute, it says that the &euro;1 billion regional fund can go to a whole range of projects.  It should say that it is specific and has to go towards putting life back into high streets in every 19th century town in Ireland.  They are dying.  As John Moran has said, &euro;1 billion is not enough.  That should be exclusively what it is for and the towns and counties that would come up with the best solutions could be replicated elsewhere.  Make them meet that challenge of restoring the 19th century towns.  It brings life back into the towns rather than letting them die and it benefits the whole country.  There is none of that.<br\/><br\/>On enhancing local powers, it is abundantly clear that we need a directly elected mayor of Dublin.  Today at the transport committee we saw the usual thing where there are 40 agencies responsible for transport in Dublin, every one blaming the other.  The buck needs to stop somewhere.  It needs a mayor to manage this city and each of the other cities.  I would like to have seen real powers being given and the allocation of money for those towns and for regeneration.<br\/><br\/>Finally, we need a cost rental housing model as the cities develop in order to get to a more unitary housing system, about which we will speak more in the coming weeks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100047#AAA00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519235700,"counter":624,"content":"<p>County Tipperary has been snubbed in this national development plan.  It is a county with a population of approximately 160,000 and is the sixth largest county by area in the country and the second largest in the southern region.  In its submission and contribution to the plan, Tipperary County Council sought to ensure that the county plays an important and central part in the future of Ireland and its southern region and believes that the county is well positioned to play that role.  It went on to state that Tipperary county, its council, community, citizens, businesses, voluntary organisations have a vision capacity, track record and drive to contribute positively to achieving the goals and ambition of the plan.  It recommended that the plan should recognise the importance of Clonmel to the successful development of south Tipperary, the south-east region and, indeed, the southern region.  Furthermore it said that the plan should recognise the importance of Nenagh for the development of north Tipperary, the mid-west region and the southern region generally.  Instead, what we got was the plan announced on Friday, which excludes all Tipperary towns from being growth centres and priority for development.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's spin machine, the strategic communications unit funded by taxpayers, choreographed the launch of the national planning framework or Project Ireland 2040 on Friday.  A more realistic title would be the \"National Planning Framework: Pie in the Sky 2040\".  <\/p><p>Despite the hype and the fanfare, the Fine Gael plan has almost entirely snubbed County Tipperary.  Like Fianna F&aacute;il's national spatial strategy, announced by former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in 2002, before it, no Tipperary town is earmarked as a growth centre or prioritised for investment or job creation.  Every Tipperary town was excluded from the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton's regional jobs plan in 2014 as well.  Ten other towns were earmarked for advance factories and advance offices, but not a single Tipperary town.  Instead, there is a concentration of growth and investment and priority for jobs for Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Athlone, Letterkenny, Drogheda and Dundalk.  These are the urban areas favoured for future growth.  This means that those towns and cities will have key strategic and economic advantages over all towns in County Tipperary.  Put more starkly, Tipperary towns will be systematically discriminated against in the area of growth, job creation and investment.  In effect, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, in particular, because they are adjacent to Tipperary, will suck the lifeblood, investment, growth and jobs from the county and this simply has to be changed.  Tipperary must get its fair share.  It must have at least two towns recognised and prioritised as growth centres.<\/p> <p> The motorway status for the N24 roadway has also been ignored in this plan for the umpteenth time.  The N24 is a key economic and social driver for the south of the county but it is also substandard and dangerous in many stretches.  The county council put forward a realistic plan for the connection of Limerick to Cork, through the N24 to Cahir, on to the M8 and on to Cork giving a saving of &euro;380 million.  It was also ignored.  Our rail lines are under threat.  The Ballybrophy line and the Limerick-Waterford line are under threat on a daily basis.  Tipperary town, because of the lack of development of the motorway N24 and bypass, will continue to be choked by thousands of vehicles, including heavy goods vehicles, driving through its main street.  There will be no bypass either for Carrick-on-Suir in this plan.<\/p> <p> The Fine Gael-lndependent Alliance Government, supported, unfortunately, and propped up by Fianna F&aacute;il, has made a deliberate political choice to discriminate against Tipperary.  The plan in reality refers to 179 projects and &euro;40 billion of expenditure already announced, with the rest of it fuzzy, uncosted and with little or no timelines.  The expenditure figure of &euro;116 billion is used to give the impression of a significant increase in spending but when population growth and use of gross national income instead of gross domestic product are taken into account, the investment proposed in this plan is at best modest, rising from 2.9% in 2018 to 4.1% in 2027, which is still below the European average.<\/p> <p> The much-hyped climate and energy section of the plan will, by the Taoiseach's own admission, miss the EU climate and energy agreed targets by a whopping 60%.  The Taoiseach also raised the prospect of new taxes in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100048#BBB00200","speaker":"1348","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519236300,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100049#CCC00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1519236300,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I will wind up now.<\/p><p>This plan must be revisited and it must be reversed.

I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that this is the first time a Government has sought to put &euro;116 billion of Exchequer and public funds behind the spatial plan.  It is the first time we have ever tried to build compact cities with balanced regional development, spreading the development, containing the growth of Dublin to only a 25% increase, seeing our new cities grow by double that and seeing our town centres revived.

Like all of the Members who have contributed and spoken here in this debate on previous occasions, I, too, have my own personally held views on the issue of abortion.  While my views are no greater or no more worthy of mention than those of anyone else, as a legislator I have a fundamental duty to ensure that it is the voice of the people that wins out and that it is their will that is done.<\/p>  <p>  On that note, and putting aside the arguments of conscience and rights for a second, it is critical that we strip this debate back and look at it more fundamentally because whether one opposes abortion outright or one believes in a woman's right to choose, the eighth amendment to the Constitution does little, if anything, to promote either of those causes.  Instead, the eighth amendment is a provision which effectively serves solely to criminalise women who, for whatever the reason, have made a conscious decision to end a pregnancy.  It criminalises any decision regardless of whether the life of the mother is at risk should she carry the child to term or where she has been the victim of a dreadful crime, such as rape or incest.  What logical reason then is there to punish that person further by criminalising her in the eyes of the law?  There is no compassion or sense of decency in inflicting yet more suffering on such a person, yet that is exactly what the eighth amendment does.  This being the case, what reason is there not to support its repeal?<\/p>  <p>  Moving away from that basic fact, however, we must further ask ourselves the question as to why anyone, including Members of the House, should have the right to impose his or her views on another person.  Surely, if we truly believe in the ability of the women of Ireland to determine their own fates and to decide their own destinies, why should we not trust them enough to make up their own minds when it comes to an issue as important as this?<\/p>  <p>  For our part, my party and I have been unambiguous in our position in respect of the eighth amendment.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports its repeal.  This is the stance which reflects the overwhelming view of the majority of our members and is, I believe, the stance that reflects the overwhelming view of the majority of the citizens of this State because, ideological differences and matters of personal conscience aside, the issue of abortion is an important matter of public health, of women's health and women's health care more broadly.<\/p><p>While I do not believe for one second that the subject of abortion is a clear-cut, black-and-white issue, it is one which nonetheless requires an open, honest and balanced debate.  The debate must be inclusive and we must hear all the views and arguments put forward by all sides while, above all else, remaining mindful and respectful of one another.  This is why this referendum on the repeal of the eighth amendment must be held as soon as possible in order that the people will finally have their say.  This subject is by its very nature emotive and often divisive and polarises public opinion.  Notwithstanding the diverging stances which have been adopted by the various sides on this issue, one cannot deny that the arguments being made by all sides are worthy of consideration.  I sincerely hope, whatever the result of the forthcoming referendum - and I hope it will be to repeal the eighth amendment - that the debate which precedes it is tolerant, compassionate and respectful of all who choose to partake in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100049#CCC02800","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519236900,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Is anyone else who has not already spoken offering to contribute to the debate?

Across the House, regardless of people's views on this, we need a reasoned debate and respect, as Members of all sides have pointed out.  As many Deputies, Senators and other people in public life know from some of the emails and other material we receive, there are people on both sides of the debate whose correspondence is not helpful or in the spirit of reasoned and respectful debate.  However, every Deputy, regardless of which side of this debate he or she is on, must contend with this.  I fear that over the coming months, as different sides get entrenched in the debate, it will cause a fierce split.  We as politicians need to ensure we show leadership, regardless of which side we are on, and that we have this debate in a reasoned and fair manner in which both sides of this argument - this is very important - get fair hearings and that it is not lopsided in any way.<\/p>  <p>  From listening to people in recent weeks, if one does the tallying, it looks like this will go to a referendum.  While people might not agree with this, the Irish people will probably go to the polls to decide the matter in May or June, whenever the Minister has the legislative process in place.  From talking to people, I understand there are grave concerns out there.  I have made my position very clear: I am opposed to this.  I worry about the way we are going with the Attorney General's advice - I know it is not the Minister's.  From listening to what the Minister has said - and I was on a programme with him - I understand it will now basically be removed, that the Irish people will not have a vote on the matter again and that it will be put into the hands of the political class now and into the future to deal with whatever legislative process or times or limits are put on it.  There is a genuine worry about this.  It is not that people will brand the present Government or future Governments, but down the road we do not know how far this will go.  There is concern among many people about the proposals.  I know there is nothing definite yet as to what the legislation will look like, but I think the 12-weeks issue is a big worry for many people, to put it very bluntly.<\/p>  <p>  We want to ensure our debate is reasoned.  I have heard about people who have disabilities and so on.  It is important that wild statements are not made but also that people do not deny accuracies in statements that are made.  I worry about Denmark.  I think it is Denmark that has basically stated how it sees its people with disabilities into the future, and that is a worry for everyone.  The people of Ireland need to be told very clearly that when they go to the polls for the referendum this time, they will decide once and for all whether to give power to Members of the D&aacute;il to legislate in this area.  It is important, as with most other decisions that are of importance to the country, that people get the opportunity of a referendum.  I know it has been 35 years since the 1983 referendum and that some people never got the chance to vote on this.  However, we are going in a worrying direction in that the ability of the Irish people, and not their elected representatives, to decide will be over once and for all.  There is a concern that the law may become more and more liberal, according to people to whom I have been talking.  We must also be mindful of the women of Ireland and of the unborn and we must ensure we understand and show respect.  I have visited houses in which there have been perhaps four different opinions on this issue.  If the Government is to send the issue for a referendum, all the facts need to be out there.  I have made my position very clear: I am opposed to this.  I have said as much from day one and I will stay with my position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100050#DDD00300","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1519236900,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I call the Minister to round up the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100050#DDD00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1519236900,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues for their contributions to the statements this evening and over the course of what has been quite a lengthy and extensive debate over a number of sessions in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the findings and the report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I said here when I opened this debate that I hoped we could show in these Houses that the debate can take place in an atmosphere of respect for one another's views in order that the same is possible in the context of a referendum campaign.  I think it is fair to say that has happened and people have come here and spoken freely and with conviction from their different points of view and with respect for those who are listening both inside and outside this Chamber.  I very much respect that.  It has served the issue and the debate well, regardless of people's perspectives.  It is such a sensitive subject for so many people, and we must all work to avoid language that can be deeply hurtful to others.  From my point of view, as Minister for Health, I am trying to deal with the facts and the realities which face us as a country as we move forward to try to address them, in particular the legacy of the eighth amendment.  I remain concerned by the reality which faced the 3,265 women who travelled to the UK in 2016.  These are real Irish women, not numbers or statistics: our sisters, friends, neighbours and wives, with real, personal reasons for the difficult decisions they made that led them on that often very lonely and distressing journey to a different country for care.<\/p><p>As I said then, a number of women from every single county in Ireland travelled in 2016.  There is not one constituency this did not impact on women.  Members' constituents have been impacted by this.  Their constituents have had to leave Ireland to go abroad to access terminations.  It has been bothering me since I put those county statistics on the record of the House that I neglected to acknowledge another 520 Irish women who were among that number but chose not to state what county they were from.<br\/><br\/>I spoke also at the opening of the debate of the new reality facing us of abortion pills now being bought on the Internet and used by women in this country without medical supervision.  No longer does an Irish woman need to go abroad for an abortion.  It is now happening here in this country with the illegal use of an abortion pill without any medical supervision.  These are facts we must face.  These are facts we can no longer avoid.  Abortion is a reality in Ireland today.  Unregulated abortion is a reality in Ireland today.  Unrestricted abortion is a reality in Ireland today.  The eighth amendment has not changed this fact and, far from providing certainty, it has left women and doctors in impossible situations, alone in the care of other countries and often finding their personal health situations before the courts.  It does not allow any room for us to care properly for women and children who are pregnant as a result of rape or for those families who receive the devastating diagnosis that their baby will not survive outside of the womb.<br\/><br\/>For the first time since 1983 the Irish people are to have their say on the substantive issue of the eighth amendment and whether it should be removed from our Constitution.  This follows recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly and the cross-party Oireachtas committee, as well as a Government decision last month that a referendum be held.  That referendum will propose that Article 40.3.3&deg; is deleted in its entirety and a clause inserted that makes it clear that the Oireachtas may legislate to regulate termination of pregnancy.  Last month, I was given Government approval to draft the Bill which would allow for the referendum to take place, and yesterday I brought the heads of the Bill to Cabinet for approval.  The Bill will now be fully drafted and brought to Cabinet for approval, before being published at the beginning of March.  This will allow a referendum to take place by the end of May.<br\/><br\/>If I could send just one message this evening, it would be to remember that the referendum must be passed and the eighth amendment repealed if anything is to change for Irish women.  We have heard many politicians from all parties say that we need to change the <i>status quo<\/i>.  There have been differences and a debate about what should come after it, but many people have said we need to change the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Let us be clear, if we want to change the <i>status quo<\/i>we must repeal the eighth amendment.  This is an important reality.  This is a statement of fact.  If we do not repeal the eighth amendment, Irish women in crisis situations, such as fatal foetal abnormalities or women who have been raped and abused, will continue to be forced to travel abroad to have a termination, or purchase abortion pills illegally online and use them without any medical supervision or support.  These situations cannot change unless and until we repeal the eighth amendment.<br\/><br\/>I am working on drafting legislation which would follow a repeal of the eighth amendment if the people choose to vote for that in the referendum.  We set up a process as a Government where we asked the Citizens' Assembly, a gathering of civic-minded citizens, to come together and consider issues, and we asked that their report be considered by an Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100050#DDD00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519237500,"counter":659,"content":"<p>They were not from every county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100051#EEE00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1519237500,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Can we have a civilised debate and not interrupt each other?<\/p>  <p>  The committee did a huge volume of work and produced a cross-party report with recommendations.  I thank them, from all parties and none, for their work and dedication to that difficult task.  The draft legal framework being prepared by the Department is based on these recommendations.  It is very important to say that if the people of Ireland do not repeal Article 40.3.3&deg;, this legislation becomes hypothetical because we cannot make any further changes on any aspect, be it fatal foetal abnormality, rape, incest, women's health or any other issue, as long as the constitutional ban remains.  However, I intend to publish a policy paper at the beginning of March which will outline what that legislation would include so that public and political debate can be informed.  I want to say now that what this entails is a proposal to make termination of pregnancy safely and legally available in this country in more circumstances than it is now, but it will remain restricted to certain circumstances.  It will propose to make terminations lawful up to 12 weeks in order to provide care to those women in crisis pregnancy who might otherwise be forced to travel, to take the abortion pill unsupervised, or who have been the victims of rape.  There will be restrictions, such as the involvement of a medical practitioner, a restriction that does not exist today with regard to the abortion pill.  Beyond the first trimester, terminations will only be available in the exceptional circumstances set out in the committee's recommendations and following the assessment of two medical professionals.  In all other circumstances abortion will remain unlawful.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's response to the committee's report will not just be confined to regulating termination.  What are termed the ancillary recommendations in the report are also important.  These are with regard to access to contraception, sex education in our schools, support for women in crisis pregnancies and perinatal care.  The Government's response will look at all of these issues and not just the issue of regulation of terminations in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge again the way this particular issue challenges us.  It causes us to ask difficult questions of ourselves and makes us uncomfortable as we collectively wrestle with what is, at its core, a very personal, private matter.  We all know the joyous thing that news of a pregnancy is for so many, but we also know it is a terrifying thing for some and a tragic thing for others.  Right now, Irish women are driven to find their own solutions and sometimes they put themselves at risk in doing so.  We cannot ignore this reality.  They are left without help, advice or support at one of the most vulnerable times in their lives.  I genuinely hope that as a country we can no longer tolerate a law which denies care and understanding to women who are our friends, our sisters, our mothers, our daughters and our wives.  I know I can no longer tolerate it.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that as we continue to debate ahead of the forthcoming referendum we will continue to be guided by two fundamental principles, namely, trusting women and trusting doctors.  In doing so, and in listening to each other with respect, I believe we as a people can make the momentous decision ahead of us with clarity, compassion and care.  I look forward to returning to the House in the coming weeks with a constitutional amendment Bill which, if passed by the Houses, will facilitate a referendum on this very important issue by the end of May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100051#EEE00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1519237500,"counter":661,"content":"<p>That concludes statements on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100051#EEE00400","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Project Ireland 2040: Statements (Resumed)","time":1519237500,"counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100051#EEE00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1519237500,"counter":663,"content":"<p>This is a significant change.  For the first time we are trying to match our ambition for the way in which the country should develop with &euro;116 billion worth of investment.  This is very ambitious.  The Acting Chairman and I have sat through many a development plan or strategic plan for the country that did not have a brass ha'penny put in behind it.  This time those things are joined together.  It is a significant change.  It means we are moving away from the developer-led model that has afflicted the city and country for so many years, where we see houses built on a sprawling basis without the matching services coming together.  This time we are looking to build a compact city anticipating in advance the services that will be needed to deliver them.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a policy of one for everyone in the audience.  It recognises we need to grow particular areas that have the capacity to be strong and regionally vibrant, but it does not leave behind our rural hinterland.  It recognises that half of the growth in population has to be entirely outside the major cities, be it Dublin or any of the other four cities.<\/p>  <p>  I represent Dublin, and it is exciting that we are now anticipating not just 140,000 extra homes that will be built but an investment of &euro;7 billion in public transport, with a metro link, BusConnects and extensions of the DART.  We anticipate bringing water from the Shannon to provide for our city.  We anticipate investments in our ports and airports.  We anticipate investment in our cultural institutions to make them a big part of our city.  For the first time, we will create a technological university for Dublin, which will be a very exciting applied research college that will offer new opportunities for people.<\/p><p>We have shown huge ambition around apprenticeships, skills and traineeships, concerns that were neglected for too long.  Besides that, we are also anticipating major investment in those other colleges that are so important.  We are looking at the sustainability of the city, and despite what the Green Party has said, this plan anticipates the decarbonisation of electricity generation.  It anticipates moving away from diesel as one of our fuels.  It anticipates electric vehicles playing an important part.  Most of all, however, it anticipates compact development.  To make that a reality, in another first, we will have a national agency with the capacity to put together the tracts of land that will be so important to achieving compact development.  Not only will we have the necessary arteries of infrastructure, we will have the capacity to pull those compact tracts of land together and develop them in a sustainable way.  There is a lot of fresh thinking here.  I was disappointed in the tone of the debate, because this is really important to our city.<\/p> <p> The area of health is one about which I know the Acting Chairman, Deputy Broughan, is particularly concerned.  For the first time ever, we are planning a new elective-only hospital for Dublin, which makes eminent sense.  It will not have an accident and emergency department, and will not contend with the associated impact.  We are anticipating moving our three maternity hospitals to a much safer co-location with a general hospital, so that women who are in situations were their lives or health are under threat have access to the full range of services, which is the proper approach.  We are building a national forensic hospital up to state-of-the-art conditions, and a national children's hospital.  These are really important investments in a city that has suffered from lack of adequate hospital beds to meet our challenges.  <\/p> <p> Another thing that I find really exciting is that it is very much bottom-up.  Some people criticise the idea that there are funds to encourage imaginative solutions for our town centres.  It was interesting that in the very same breath as those criticisms, there were calls for imaginative ways to see our town centres grow.  What better way than to ask those whose lives, commitment and understanding is rooted in those towns to come up with the ideas, whether urban or rural regeneration is required?  That is a very exciting approach to take, because it recognises that we are all part of making this a reality.  It is not going to be designed in Marlborough Street or the Custom House.  It has to have a community commitment. <\/p> <p> I would like to say a few words about the importance of talent in the realisation and conception of this plan.  The only way in which we can achieve balanced regional development is on the basis of the quality of the talent that we create.  I used to be the Minister at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, and I saw how difficult it is to attract new industrial development unless networks and hubs of skill, talent, enterprise capability and research capacity have been built.  That is what attracts and builds, whether overseas investment is coming in or indigenous enterprise is innovating the new products that can drive success, be it in food or engineering.  We are seeing those success stories.  We need to root them in major investment in the talent base of our regions. <\/p> <p> At the heart of this is the concept of developing technological universities.  They will become vehicles for carrying a much stronger applied research capability and a much more balanced mix, while still rooted in their origins, namely, developing technical skill.  They will be rooted in those origins, but will spread their influence into the higher reaches of education and encourage people to travel that road with them.  I believe that those hubs of skill will be very important in realising our ambition for balanced regional development.  <\/p> <p> Equally, the envisaged investment of &euro;8.4 billion in our school system is crucially important.  It represents an investment of about &euro;9,000 for every child in our school system.  These investments are really crucial, and not just to meet the needs of a growing population.  We must build the school laboratories that allow our children to develop their skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and to apply digital technology within the education system.  It is so empowering, both of student and teacher alike, to embed digital technologies in learning.  <\/p> <p> It also anticipates the PE facilities that we will need.  We want to see people grow in a resilient way, both mentally and physically.  We need to invest in our schools, invest in their leadership and provide modern facilities.  This plan recognises the importance of this investment.  That investment in the education sector has not been there in the past.  We continue to chase a moving target, trying to keep up with education needs that are racing ahead of us.  This plan anticipates the sort of things that the 21st century school will need.  It lays the foundations and commits to the funding that will allow that vision to become a reality. <\/p> <p> I can fully understand that the House will greet a ten-year plan of great national ambition with a degree of scepticism. I think it is natural that people will complain and ask when they will see these results, or whether the plan is a reality.  However, I have been in politics a long time, and I rarely see Governments seeking to plan in any realistic way beyond the next election or the next political hurdle.  This is a genuine attempt to do something different.  This is anticipating the Ireland that we will see in ten years.  God knows how many Governments will be in place between now and then, but it is a genuine attempt to shape and anticipate the Ireland we want to see in 2027 and 2040.  How do we go about getting that?<\/p> <p> At the root of the plan are the right concepts: make our country compact in its development; make it regionally spread; and make it environmentally sustainable.  Build it on a base of talent and fulfil the potential of each young person, each community and each reason.  These are the fundamental building blocks of any long-term plan for our country.  There will be critics, sceptics and people asking why some concern or other was left out, but the underlying drive of what we are trying to do is unique in my lifetime.  The Acting Chairman will agree that it is so frustrating to draw up development plans, knowing in one's heart of hearts that these projects are never going to happen. They are objectives on paper.  We now have the chance to match the objectives, worthy as they have always been, with hard cash and commitment.  I hope that the plan will commend itself to the House, given time.  I am sure there will be short-term political criticism of course, but what we are trying to achieve here is the right thing for the country to do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100051#EEE00600","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519238100,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I have to say, I am very disappointed that all the time we are getting to speak about this monumentally comprehensive piece of work is ten minutes.  The plan is based on research that has been hosted on the national planning framework website since 24 January.  There is a paper on this site called \"Prospects for Irish Regions and Counties\".  Its basic thesis is that larger industrial conglomerations in centres of high population density result in a higher net output per worker.  As such, the proposition on which this plan is based is that future developments should be concentrated in four cities, namely, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  In the report, everywhere outside of these cities is described by the pejorative term \"sprawl\".  The report claims that this kind of concentration will result in a higher national growth, and will also lead to regional growth up to 40 km to 80 km from regional cities.  The author of this report quotes Government studies carried out in 1996, 2002 and 2009 to support the link between density and higher output.  Interestingly, on page 78 the author includes a scatter plot showing industrial output per worker.  He measures this against population density on a county-by-county basis.  <\/p><p>The idea was that when taking output per worker and population density, it was expected that as the density increased, the output per worker would increase.  The plot purports to show that net output per worker increases with population density from &euro;140,000 at the lowest to approximately &euro;240,000 at the highest.  There are a number of errors in the plot and it is extraordinary that the counties are not identified.  Strangely, Dublin is omitted from the graph, even though it has a significantly higher population density than any other county.  Leaving Dublin, the most densely populated county, out means that, scientifically, the claim is baseless.  What they tried to do was take data from the census of industrial production for the years 2002 to 2006 and measure it against the population census of 2016 for some peculiar reason.  This is shoddy work by any account.<\/p> <p> County Mayo has the second lowest population density in the State.  The county has half the population of Galway city and county and just over half the density at 23 people per sq. km as opposed to 41 per sq. km in Galway and its industrial workforce is significantly less than half that of Galway, yet gross industrial output in Mayo is equal to and in some years exceeds that of Galway.  If the inputs into production in Galway are taken into account, net industrial output in Mayo is one and a third to one and a half times that in Galway.  In other words, Mayo, with a low population density, is producing one and a half times what is being produced in Galway per worker.  This is not unique to that county.  I am sure Deputy Healy will be interested to learn that rural Tipperary has a net output per worker which is a multiple of that of Waterford city and county.  Kildare with a density of 131 persons per sq. km has a higher net output per worker than Dublin city with a density of 4,687 per sq. km.<\/p> <p> What blows the mind on the theory on which all this crumbling castle is based is that the comparison could not be starker between Mayo, which has the second lowest population density in the State, and Dublin city, which has the highest, as the output per industrial worker in Mayo is approximately twice that of Dublin.  The thesis started out with a theory that industrial workers produce more in cities.  The Government then published a major foundation document, yet according to one person's analysis, the figures have been skewed to get an answer that is not there.  Furthermore, industry in Mayo is scattered around the county.  Coca-Cola is based in Ballina, Baxter in Castlebar, Allergan in Westport and McHales in Ballinrobe.  They are not all agglomerated in one part of the county.  I am beginning to wonder, because I have not had the opportunity to read the entire document and second guess all the research, whether it is based on a false premise.  If so, perhaps the future will not turn out the way people think it will.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, ten minutes is not sufficient even to start dealing with all the issues but I would like to address two specific issues.  I would love to see a spatial plan that would eliminate the horrendous social deprivation in my native city of Dublin.  I would love to be able to say in 20 years that all the people in Dublin, not just those in the leafy suburbs, live in a society that is driven more by industrial output than the drugs trade and that the scourge of social deprivation has been dealt with and similar comments apply to Limerick, Tipperary town and all the black spots that we mapped so carefully in government under the RAPID programme.  If that could be done, we would have a plan worthy of consideration.  There is a great deal of repetition and contradiction in the plan and one would think it was written to confuse.  There is no mention of a great plan to deal with social deprivation, which is a scandal before all of us but which we tend to wish would go away.  I recall as Minister with responsibility for urban deprivation that I could not get the media to hang around the House and be interested in it but that does not mean we should fail to be concerned.<\/p> <p> I refer to the second issue that must be examined.  Rarely in life is the future a repetition of the past.  I studied science and I recall lecturers discussing the assumptions of late 19th century scientists about light and its nature and so on.  The theory was blown sky high out of the water.  We know from previous experience that most people plan on the basis of what happened in the past and not on what is likely to happen in the future.  The visionaries are those that see what is happening.  If the Minister visits rural areas in counties Galway or Meath, he knows that as soon as people get the fibre cable, the necessity for them to be agglomerated every day will suddenly disappear.  I love coming up to Dublin.  I come up because of my job most weeks but I would come up anyway to go to Croke Park because I love going to matches there because they are great social events.  I like coming to the city now and again for social events but I would prefer to live where I live.  Many high net worth individuals whose main work is done on a computer and who work worldwide right through the time zones will not work in conventional offices.  They work from wherever they are.  Will they choose to sit in traffic jams in the morning before arriving to work in a cramped office or will they choose to live in a beautiful house overlooking the ocean or the mountains?  That is the future but the Government is planning for the past.  This plan is fundamentally flawed in its concept and I ask the Minister of State to check the figures I quoted, which are now on the record.  I hope I get a detailed response as to why these figures are wrong.  The graph does not give us the counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100052#FFF00200","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519238700,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Quinlivan and Martin Kenny.<\/p><p>Climate change is the major issue of our time and it is relevant in the context of this plan.

The NPF is a series of vague aspirations which lack clarity and vision.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The Government plan states that there will be energy research funding into solar and biogas but these are well established industries worldwide and particularly across Europe.  We do not need to conduct a whole new batch of research into these as they are already up and running and working.  We need to specify what energy sources will replace fossil fuel.  There is a proposal to stop using peat and coal by 2030 and to convert the coal-burning plant at Moneypoint at a cost of &euro;1 billion but it does not say what will replace it.  There is a proposal to phase out peat by 2030 and that will affect Laois-Offaly, Westmeath and the whole midlands.  Again, though, there is no outline of what will replace it and there is no plan to establish an indigenous biomass growing industry in counties such as Laois, Offaly, Westmeath or anywhere else.  Bord na M&oacute;na imports biomass from across the globe at present and it has imported it from as far away as Indonesia.  It is nuts and it is not sustainable from an environmental point of view given the carbon miles that this will clock up.  It also intends to buy a biomass plant in the United States.  Why is the Government, as a shareholder on behalf of the taxpayer, not insisting there is a plant built in the midlands to process biomass such as willow, which could be grown by local farmers and would create local jobs, to be used in local generation plants such as Longford or Edenderry in west Offaly?<\/p> <p> What about biogas?  It is mentioned but there is no clarity on if or how it will be established.  There is huge potential in biogas and we have some of the best resources in Europe with our large farming sector.  Biogas would deal with the present problem of slurry and we could use that and other waste, such as food waste, to produce electricity, heat and transport fuel.  This would provide a boost to farm incomes and bring jobs into rural areas across the country.  The Government plan is for 500,000 electric vehicles by 2030 and that is welcome but there is no mention of how this will be achieved.  We only have 2,000 on the road currently, among the lowest in Europe, and no certainty around the charging network so how can we achieve this target?<\/p> <p> I see nothing about local authorities in the plan.  Local authorities are the arm of government that interacts with local communities, as the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, will know.  We need to take climate change seriously and there is a big role for local authorities, something Sinn F&eacute;in has been pushing for a long time.  There is a need for a clear plan that includes local authorities as well as the sectors mentioned.  We need specific actions and we need to specify energy sources.  If we do not do this we will continue to use fossil fuels in an unsustainable way and to live in an unsustainable manner, causing damage to the environment.  I ask the Government to revisit the role of local authorities and to be more specific in relation to creating a biomass and a biogas industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100053#GGG00200","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519239300,"counter":669,"content":"<p>It is essential for the success of this project, and for its vision to be achieved in 20 years' time, that the national planning framework has broad, cross-party support.  I am disappointed that the Government is trying to ram it through without a vote on its contents.  It should be a solid, comprehensive plan for the country and not a brochure for the Fine Gael Party.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad that many of the proposals which Sinn F&eacute;in mid-west representatives, including myself, suggested are included.  As a representative of Limerick city, I am delighted that the M20 motorway is included in the plan but we have been promised that road before.  It was the current Taoiseach who scrapped the M20 plans back in 2011, when Minister for Transport, so forgive me if I hold back my praise for the project as it is re-announced seven years later.  I will be happy when the motorway is built, rather than when it is repackaged and reannounced.  The road is needed and it will not just benefit the cities of Limerick and Cork but the whole region. <\/p>  <p>  Shannon Airport is referenced six times but there are no plans to maintain it, to sustain it or to grow it.  Most of the projects for my constituency are continuations of things or plans that have been previously announced.  I am happy to see the Limerick 2030 project in the national development plan, as well as the Limerick to Foynes road, the Limerick to Foynes railway and the continuation of the Limerick regeneration project.  We need to develop Limerick City as the major city in the mid-west region.  However, Limerick suffers from a disproportionately high number of unemployment black spots and areas of deprivation and these problems require Limerick-specific solutions now, before we can plan for 20 years' time.<\/p>  <p>  In January the ESRI published a major study into deprivation in 11 EU countries between 2004 and 2015, which showed a significant gap between the rate of deprivation experienced by vulnerable adults in Ireland and that of others surveyed.  In the national development plan for the next ten years, the word \"poverty\" does not appear once.  Maybe a focus on that issue would mean Limerick would not have 18 electoral divisions classed as unemployment black spots, which is twice as many as in any other part of the country.  The average unemployment rate for these areas is 43% and eight of ten unemployment black spots are in Limerick city.  These figures are stark and we have not reduced them over the years.  It is also more than double the combined figure for Dublin, Galway and Cork cities, which is truly shocking.  The infrastructure needs to be put in place so that people can stay, work and live in Limerick, which specifically means more social and affordable housing, better transport links and essential services such as broadband.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to see many of the suggestions made by Sinn F&eacute;in's mid-west representatives, which are in the policy document we have launched, included in the plan.

Maybe we need a plan to deliver on all the other promises the Government has made.  A Vision for Change is 11 years old and we are far from implementing that, while our community services are not in place.  This Government does business by press statements, column inches, headlines and executive summaries, which are far more important than addressing the fundamental failings in our society or focusing on the people affected.  Where is the plan to address the growing poverty in our country?  This certainly is not it.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the talk around the plan is that it is to address population growth in the future, as if we were anywhere near meeting current demand for the most basic things such as a home, health care, education and a decent standard of living.  This is a plan for tomorrow, which is fine but the hundreds of thousands of people in this State experiencing serious hardship need a plan for today and they need action.  With this Government, the problems will always be fixed tomorrow and we know where tomorrow goes.<\/p>  <p>  Our existing infrastructure is falling apart because the Government refuses to invest.  In my area of east Cork, the roads are in a drastic state outside the major routes, with councils paying out damages to motorists.  The headline is good for the Government and &euro;116 billion seems a very impressive sum, but is it impressive?  Over 23 years, it is just &euro;5 billion a year.  Some 10% of the money is said to be going to housing but, given how little the State has spent on housing in the past few years, this is the very least we should be spending.  In any case, it does not amount to much over 23 years, during which time the population will grow and grow.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;1 billion for flood defences but I wonder if it is enough.  We must consider the massive need for new housing, regional urban development, population growth and the impending severe and dangerous weather conditions brought on by climate change, not to mention the fact that flood defences are completely insufficient to deal with the problems we have currently.  There is &euro;500 million for the Defence Forces but this is not so that the members of the Defence Forces can be paid a living wage, rather than having to survive on the scraps of family income supplement, FIS, and other payments as they bravely serve our country with honour.  I expect that the money is to live up to the growing demand of Europe that we join its army and engage in the imperial rattling of old Europe.  No thanks.  That is not development as anyone else might see it.  The bottom line is that the Government cannot be trusted to do what it says in its press releases.

From the time of T.K. Whitaker in the 1950s and the years of Se&aacute;n Lemass, having objectives for a nation is important even if some or many of those objectives are not achieved, as happened with the last plan from 2002.  The scale of Ireland's infrastructure deficit is vast.  There was no reference by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to their roles in Ireland's lost decade, when Ireland did not have a plan and when we cut back on the infrastructure we had.<\/p>  <p>  For many years since the 2007-08 disastrous banking crisis I raised the issue of the deficit at the budget and finance committees.  The capital programme had been slashed and was so low that we did not even reach depreciation levels, which is the 2% level that is needed just to keep a bit of paint on the house and the doors working.  It seems extraordinary that the Taoiseach, who is one of the key people responsible for this deficit, is now trying to present Fine Gael and himself as great capital planners.<\/p>  <p>  The damage that was done in the last ten years, however, will long affect and hold back the State, urban and rural.  In an earlier contribution the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, tried his best but I believe that many people see this plan as an election manifesto of aspirational dreams.  The Taoiseach is trying to sell it as a national project.  The fundamental conclusion of most of us who ploughed through the national planning framework and then Ireland 2040 - Our Plan is that the aspirations are there, with &euro;116 billion set to be dedicated to the plan, but we have grave concerns that many of the projects that should have been achieved in the last decade are still not going to be achieved over the next decade, especially in areas such as housing and health.  Deputies have already referred to this.  The great unknown, of course, is what will happen with Brexit.  If GDP, or GNI, is significantly damaged then it may be very difficult to allocate 4% or more, which is outlined at the start of the national development plan, for capital projects each year up to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  I opposed decentralisation and the longtime core policy of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il of holding back and restricting Dublin&rsquo;s development as a major city region and the development of the other cities in Ireland.  I totally agree with the plan's focus on Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  I had expected more ambitious infrastructure targets for each major city.  I agree with the designation of Sligo, Letterkenny and Athlone.  Drogheda should have had full city status.<\/p>  <p>  In budget after budget Dublin was neglected very badly.  Professor Declan Kiberd has said that Dublin is a city dominated by a periphery.   When every other city from Athens to Madrid and up to Oslo was enhancing its capital or main cities with great public transport systems and major public facilities, Dublin became something of a backwater up to the turn of this century.  Lord Norman Foster, the famous so-called \"starchitect\", rightly says that premier city regions are always defined by their infrastructure; first class transport, health, education, public housing and so on.  Unfortunately, by that measure Dublin has never been allowed - by majorities in this House - to become a premier European capital city and we sometimes hear of the disappointment of visitors about the lack of transport and civic space infrastructure in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the plan's approach to concentrate development in major growth centres throughout the State.  I note the demographic predictions for an extra 1 million people.  For some time EUROSTAT has said that Ireland will have a population of 5.5 million by 2050 and that the UK will have a population of more than 80 million.  Depending on the outcome of Brexit there may be a significant migration between Britain and Ireland.  It will be interesting to see if the 2050 figure may even be higher.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to be an emigration nation.  Had the disasters of the 1980s and of the banking crisis not happened, Ireland's population would probably be well past the 5 million mark in the Republic and heading back to the population of Ireland at the start of the 1840s.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the State is divided into three regions to facilitate EU investment but what is wrong with just using Leinster, Munster and Connacht and with the three northern counties in close liaison with the counties of Ulster?  Leinster&rsquo;s population is now around 2.4 million with the four Dublin counties heading for 1.5 million.  As a Dublin representative I would like to see one of the tasks of this plan being to consolidate and expand the Dublin city region up to 2027 and 2040 as a premier metropolitan district for the whole country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100055#JJJ00100","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1519239900,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy Broughan to propose the adjournment of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100055#JJJ00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519239900,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I move the adjournment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100055#JJJ00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519239900,"counter":674,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Supporting the Suckling Sector: Motion [Private Members]","time":1519239900,"counter":675,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100055#JJJ00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1519239900,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann: <br \/><br \/>notes:<blockquote>&mdash;

Up to now, unfortunately, we have seen unwillingness from the Government to actually recognise the need to provide that support.<br \/><br \/>This is a crucial sector.  It underpins Ireland's &euro;2.5 billion beef exports.  More than 70,000 farm families are involved in the suckler cow sector and depend on it for their income.  For every &euro;1 invested in the suckler cow beef sector there is a &euro;4 return to the local economy in which the farm families play such a crucial role.<br \/><br \/>Fianna F&aacute;il has supported this measure for a long time and it was part of our manifesto during the last general election.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, that this is a measure we want to see delivered.  This is being strongly advocated by the farming organisations.  I welcome to the Public Gallery a delegation from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, led by their livestock chairman, Mr. Angus Woods.  I also welcome to the Public Gallery the president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, Mr. Patrick Kent.  I acknowledge the tremendous work and campaigning by the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>and the IFA as part of that campaign, led very much by the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>beef and suckler editor, Mr. Adam Woods.<br \/><br \/>I shall outline the key parts of the motion that we have put before the Minister.  My party members will speak on this and I know we will receive strong support from Sinn F&eacute;in and other Members in the D&aacute;il.  The motion focuses first of all on the need to support the suckler herd.  The motion calls for us to look at the underspend in the rural development programme so we can increase the funding available to the beef data genomics programme, towards &euro;200 in this current CAP.  The motion also calls for the introduction of a support of &euro;200 per suckler cow within the next CAP programme.  Given the pressure that will be on the beef sector as a result of Brexit, and also as a result of Mercosur, the Minister needs to seek additional funds to target the sector because it is especially exposed.<br \/><br \/>The motion also highlights the importance of a strongly-funded CAP programme from 2020 onwards, and it highlights the importance of the Government contributing to that and ensuring it is delivered at EU level.  The motion calls for the Government to row back and refute the moves we see at EU level to introduce and agree a beef non-tariff rate quota with Mercosur countries.  This is already being offered at 70,000 tonnes, and it will end up at a higher figure if a deal is done.  Unfortunately, the Minister's answers to my parliamentary questions up to this point indicate that the 70,000 tonnes is pretty much going to be agreed and accepted <i>de facto<\/i>as part of that deal.  This will have grave repercussions for our beef sector.<br \/><br \/>The motion looks for a clear and comprehensive review of the rural development programme and the underspend in this regard.<\/blockquote><p>It sets a deadline of two months for the Minister, working with his Department, to fully review the spending that has already occurred within the rural development programme, programme by programme, and to revert to the D&aacute;il with a clear outline as to how targets are being met, or not being met, as is unfortunately the case.  We can then, as a D&aacute;il, work to ensure that money is spent and is targeted towards the suckler cow in terms of increasing funding to the beef data genomics programme and the areas of natural constraint programme.<\/p> <p> I just want to touch on the level of underspend across a few of the programmes.  When the Government announced the GLAS programme, it committed to spending &euro;1.4 billion.  As of now it has only spend &euro;300 million.  Some 78% of the commitment remains unspent.  It is clear from the replies I have received to parliamentary questions that by the end of 2020-2021, the Department will only have spent &euro;1 billion of that funding, leaving a &euro;400 million shortfall.  Similarly, targets under the beef data genomics programme, the knowledge transfer programme and the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, have not been met and there will be an underspend in these areas.  We believe that underspend should be targeted towards the suckler cow.  In terms of funding the &euro;200 per head payment, the Minister needs to get fresh money as part of the next CAP in light of Brexit and Mercosur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100055#JJJ00600","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519240500,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I compliment my colleague, Deputy McConalogue, for bringing forward this very important Private Members' Bill.

Unfortunately, the developments of the past week have shown that a hard border looks set to be the outcome of Brexit.  That is going to put huge pressure on our beef industry.  Our dependence on the UK market grew in 2017 in spite of the best efforts of Bord Bia.  Some 50% of our beef is sold in the UK market and a hard border would put huge pressure on our beef industry.  We also have the challenge of Mercosur.  Already the European Commission has offered 70,000 tonnes of tariff-free beef to South American countries and we hear on the grapevine that it is prepared to increase that offer to 99,000 tonnes.  When is our Commissioner going to say stop and that enough is enough?  When will our Government and governments across the EU step in and protect the European beef sector?  What is proposed at the moment could already cost the European beef sector &euro;5 billion and this Mercosur trade deal, coupled with Brexit, is the reason our sector must get support and must get it now.  <\/p>  <p>  Any time we talk about agriculture now we have to square up to climate change.  The beef data genomics programme, if properly funded, has a role to play in reducing our emissions and carbon footprint.  As I have said, the next round of CAP negotiations has to look at low-income sectors and extra funding has to be found if we are to avoid land abandonment in certain areas.  The case for sucklers is clear.  I would also like to mention hill sheep farmers.  An extra &euro;10 per ewe is needed to keep land in mountain and hill areas farmed.  Again, this has a key role to play in lowering our emissions and decreasing our carbon footprint.  I would be remiss to not also refer to the hen harrier scheme introduced by the Minister in recent weeks.  This scheme will be judged on whether it restores the value of land in those designated areas.  In the view of the farmers in those areas, this scheme will fail miserably.<\/p>  <p>  In the past the Commission has stepped in when countries were in need.  When the ban on exports to Russia was introduced the Commission stepped in and provided a fund for the Balkan countries affected.  We are now in a similar position.  Brexit and Mercosur are coming down the tracks towards us.  The case for funding is clear.  As has been stated by my colleague, the suckler cow sector needs that extra &euro;200 per cow if we are to maintain our beef herd.  The hill ewe also needs that extra premium and proper compensation must be provided to restore the value of designated land.  The beef forum that has been established has failed to deliver.  The arguments are clear.  The underspend in the Department in 2016 was &euro;106 million and it was &euro;78 million in 2017.  That money can be used to fund the low-income sectors while we wait for increased funding from the next round of the CAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100056#KKK00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1519240500,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I remind speakers that four Fianna F&aacute;il Members have indicated and they have a total of nine minutes between them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100056#KKK00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1519240500,"counter":680,"content":"<p>Obviously, I support the motion.  I have a number of points to raise.  The north west of the country in particular has often been described as the engine room in terms of the production of weanlings for the suckler herd in Ireland.  We are under threat of land abandonment in that part of the country given the low incomes of many farming families - some &euro;13,000 a year.  Without the introduction of a scheme such as that advocated by my colleagues, Deputies McConalogue and Cahill, we are heading down the road of land abandonment.<\/p>  <p>  When the underspend across various schemes is considered, it is vitally important that we put the money where it is needed in order to support farming families and the great culture of beef production in this country.  The industry is worth &euro;2.5 billion in income per annum.  As a former exporter who exported 35,000 cattle's worth of processed beef to 46 countries throughout the world, I know the importance of the industry and I also see the dangers of a lack of targeted supports of this nature.  While as a party we are certainly advocating for a scheme of &euro;200 a head, from a personal perspective I think there is an argument to consider even more than that and for a higher amount to be given for the first ten cows belonging to our many small farmers.  That is certainly something to consider.  <\/p>  <p>  The money is available but we are not using it.  It is critical that we come up with a scheme to ensure that we give the necessary supports.  It plays into our hand in terms of European policy in respect of food security.  Without it, we will see land abandonment in many parts of our country, particularly in the north west where I am from.  Deputy Cahill has rightly made a point about a number of schemes in respect of sheep needing to be continued and increased.  As Deputy McConalogue said, all this money is spend locally.  It supports the local economy.  It is not going out of the country.  Finally, I would advise caution on the beef data genomics scheme.  Again as a former beef exporter, I feel it needs to be examined for fear that it will create a substantially maternal herd, which would affect confirmation and the quality of beef we are producing.  I ask the Minister to look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100056#KKK00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1519240500,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Before the last election I proposed a &euro;200 per head payment for suckler cows.

They are under threat from many fronts such as Brexit and South American beef and are at the same time struggling with an average income of less than &euro;13,000 per annum.  Many are farming part time and after finishing a day's work are going back out feeding cattle and doing another day's work.  Their business is in rural areas and they are supporting local employment, spending income locally in the co-op, the vet, the shop or wherever.  We need to support these rural enterprises.  If a farm stops, it is a rural business closing down and a loss of income for the rural community.  There is a knock-on effect for so many other rural services and businesses.  The whole community suffers.<\/p>  <p>  The suckler is not paying and the national herd is dropping away as farmers move out of the business.  Around the Macroom hinterland, for example, as many as 1,000 suckler cows are gone.  The Minister will know many of the farmers who have gotten rid of the cows.  On good land there may be the option of supporting dairy, contract rearing or leasing land.  On the more marginal land there are not the same options and the farmer could very likely be planted.  That is squeezing rural communities.  If they move towards fattening from the dairy herd, that is reducing the quality of the product.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs a scheme targeting the suckler farmer - &euro;200 a cow.  There is a significant underspend across several schemes under the 2014-2020 rural development programme, which is running behind targets.

The Government is very much aware of the importance of the suckler sector to Ireland's rural economy and the wider agri-food industry.  In addition to its contribution to Irish beef exports of &euro;2.4 billion last year, it helps to support farm income for around 70,000 farm households directly.  Indirectly, it supports jobs in the meat processing sector, co-ops, feed merchants, agri-contractors and other local businesses.  The Government strongly supports a vibrant and productive national suckler herd.<\/p>  <p>  The beef data and genomic programme, BDGP, is the main support specifically targeted at the suckler sector and provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current rural development programme period.  So far under this programme, approximately &euro;125 million has been paid out to farmers and the Government will continue to support the programme through the lifetime of the current rural development programme.  This scheme, in addition to providing targeted support to Irish suckler farmers, is an important component of our national efforts to reducing the carbon footprint of our agricultural output.  The BDGP was approved following extensive negotiations with the European Commission for this innovative programme.  Supports under the programme are paid on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone by suckler farmers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the BDGP, the Government provides a range of other supports which are available to suckler farmers, including GLAS and TAMS in addition to the basic payment scheme and disadvantaged area payments.  The Government has argued and will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as is possible post-2020.  The Government is particularly aware of the potential future threat of Brexit and any Mercosur trade deal to the national suckler herd.  The Government is committed to working to ensure that Ireland's interests are strongly articulated during negotiations on Brexit.  We will continue to work with like-minded member states to protect the interests of the EU beef sector in the context of EU discussions on a trade deal with Mercosur countries.  The Government fully acknowledges the important contribution of the suckler herd to Ireland's beef exports which in 2017 amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.  Additionally, the beef produced by our pasture-based suckler farmers gives us a unique marketing advantage throughout the world.  Ireland continues to increase its footprint in international markets, which in 2017 accounted for 6% of total beef exports compared to 3% in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Since he took office the Minister, Deputy Creed, has made increasing the levels of live exports a priority.  The number of live animals exported in 2017 increased by 30% compared to 2016.  I know the Minister sees a vibrant live export trade as an important source of income for suckler farmers and will continue his efforts in this area in 2018.  The Government's view is that any future supports to the suckler herd should be designed to ensure that the national suckler herd is developed in a sustainable and efficient manner in line with the food wise strategy for the sustainable development of the agri-food sector as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100057#LLL00400","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1519241100,"counter":686,"content":"<p>There is a significant amount of ambiguity surrounding the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.

We need to be very careful here.  We have to support the suckler sector and that is one thing the Minister is very keen on doing.  The strong way to do that is through the CAP post-2020, ensuring that we negotiate strongly on behalf of the Irish Government through Europe and working with our counterparts in that.

We do not often get an opportunity to speak about agricultural issues0 and I believe we should have more opportunities to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The livestock census figures for the years 2010 to 2017, inclusive, show that the number of suckler cows in the national herd has reduced from approximately 1.15 million to 1.08  million, a reduction of around 7%.  Following the removal of milk quotas in 2015, it was anticipated that there would be a substantial reduction in the size of the national suckler cow herd.  While there has been movement from suckler cows to dairying in traditionally strong dairy counties, the overall reduction in the size of the herd has been much less than anticipated, which is very encouraging.  There are around 33,000 farmers whose main enterprise is suckler cow or cattle rearing, accounting for 23% of all farms in Ireland.  These farms are particularly reliant on direct payments to cover production costs, with average direct payments of approximately &euro;14,500, accounting for 115% of family farm income, according to Teagasc&rsquo;s national farm survey 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, an analysis of the national diary farm survey data shows that existing direct payments to suckler cow farmers provide support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow.  The BDGP which has been mentioned regularly in the House today is the main support specifically targeted at the suckler cow sector.  It will provide beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding during the current rural development programme period.  There are approximately 25,000 herds covered by the programme and approximately &euro;125 million has been paid out so far.  The basis of the programme is that genetic improvements are to be delivered by improving the maternal efficiency traits of the national herd, which will result in a corresponding reduction in the level of greenhouse gasses, GHG, per kilogram of beef produced by suckler beef animals.  Research data allow us to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions associated with each day cows calving interval is shortened, each day younger at which a cow produces its first calf and each kilogram heavier a calf is at the time of weaning.  These are the key objectives of the programme.  <\/p>  <p>  The BDGP was agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s rural development plan for the period 2014 to 2020, alongside a number of other schemes such as the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme; the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS, which also benefit suckler cow farmers.  We have heard, in the past few minutes in particular, about the underspend under different schemes.  I challenge Fianna F&aacute;il to outline where the underspend is occurring.  GLAS and TAMS payments are built into the process.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not going to sort out this problem.  Pitting farmers one against the other is not going to sort it out.  There is no way one can look for &euro;200 under the current system.  <\/p>  <p>  The current model of funding via the BDGP provides support to enable suckler cow farmers to improve efficiency and profitability by improving the overall genetic merit of their beef herd.  I firmly believe the scheme will deliver tangible long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler cow farmers participating in the scheme and farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing.  That is the only way forward.  I recently had the opportunity to attend a beef trial farm in my constituency, where there was collaborative work done between the processors, the researchers, Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and farmers.  The tangible effects of that research can be seen in the period since.  It has only been available for three years and they are planning for the future.  The fact is that there are more dairy herd animals coming into the system as a result of the increase in the size of the dairy herd and we can get the best produce from them.  The same applies to the beef cow herd.  We have learned how Angus and Hereford cattle can be produced more efficiently in the beef cow sector, how an easier calving animal is produced and how we can achieve a beefier animal.  That is the only way forward.  Extra funds could be made available under CAP 2020, but we have to have the technology and genomics programme needed.  Technology and genomics will help to make the beef sector more competitive and efficient for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100058#MMM00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1519241700,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion which was brought forward by Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  The element on which Deputies have been focusing is the suckler cow sector, as well as where the suckler cow scheme is at and how we move forward.<\/p>  <p>  Many farmers have found the BDGP very useful.  There are approximately 25,000 farmers participating in the scheme, but we know that there are three times that number of suckler cow farmers.  In that respect, there has been quite a low uptake.  While &euro;125 million has been spent in the first three years, it is only two thirds of the spend envisaged.  I acknowledge that there is a plea made in the motion for a review and the Minister to state what is going to happen in the future.  I expect what we will hear is that the money will be drawn down over a period, that after 2020 there will be money left over and that there is always this type of roll-over.  That is what we always hear.  The problem is that farmers in suckler cow areas which are mainly along the western seaboard have an average herd of approximately 18 cows.  Many of them are in my constituency.  The reality is that they are struggling to survive because every year a cow calves and the calf is reared as a weanling.  The farmer then goes to the mart and it is pot luck whether he or she will get a decent price.  Sometimes it works out well and sometimes it does not.  Even in the years farmers achieve a good price, they are still the farmers with the lowest incomes in the farming sector.  They have few options beyond pursuing this type of farming on the marginal land they own.  As most of them are smallholders, engaging in dairying is not an option.  The land is not really good enough for them to do so.  The viable options involve rearing sheep or suckler cows and engaging in forestry.  The reality is that these options are not very good.  <\/p>  <p>  These farmers provide a service for the excellent beef sector because they are the root from which it grows.  The quality of weanlings produced is excellent and there should be some recognition of this.  On the figure of &euro;200 mentioned by Deputy Pat Deering, we can all do the sums.  There are 1 million suckler cows.  If &euro;200 was to be paid for 500,000 of them, it would work out as &euro;100 million per year.  We know that there is a cost, but at this stage, if we are serious about protecting the sector, we have to try to find that money.  There is an argument to be made for increasing it even further and front-loading some of the money for smaller farmers who are producing great weanlings.  <\/p>  <p>  Other issues are raised in the motion.  I particularly want to talk about Mercosur.  The deal will  have a huge impact on the beef sector in Ireland.  If prime cuts of beef come into Europe from Latin America, at the levels being discussed or perhaps higher, it will have a very negative impact on the beef sector here.  That negative impact, coupled with the effects of Brexit, will mean serious trouble which will feed all the way back to the suckler cow sector.  <\/p>  <p>  The reality is that there is a problem with the intensification of farming.  This and other Governments for as long as we can remember have encouraged farmers to produce more in order to achieve the same income.  I know men who have been farming for 40 years who tell me that their income is lower now than it was 30 years ago when they had less cattle.  They now have less income in doing the same amount of work.  We will soon end up in a situation where more and more small family farms will go to the wall.  I do not believe that should be allowed to happen.  The farming community does not just provide a service for the beef sector which is a big employer in the country but also for the entire community.  We need to understand carbon sequestration is part of what we are doing.  It is part of from where our green and clean image as a meat and food producing country comes.  It comes from the family farm which must be protected and the only way it can be protected is if the Government steps up to the mark and provides for it.  <\/p>  <p>  Other schemes mentioned include GLAS, the BDGP, the knowledge transfer scheme, TAMs and the new sheep scheme, all of which provide a little hope for farmers.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, for very many of them, that hope is waning constantly because they see that the level of return they get for the actual food they produce is being squeezed.  That is something that must be recognised.<\/p> <p> We had representatives of the meat industry before the committee yesterday and we asked them why Irish farmers were getting only an average price in the factory compared to farmers in the rest of Europe when the cattle in many parts of Europe are produced in a totally different way.  We have the cream of the crop, yet we get only an average price.  Those questions have to be put strongly to the entire sector.  We need to recognise that it is not all about the cheque in the post.  That said, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget has to be maintained.  We have to ensure that we have an adequate budget to provide for farmers into the future.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister to remember that this is about the family farm.  The suckler sector, and the sheep sector in particular, are crucial to this because they are the two sectors that are made up of the small family farms that are struggling to survive.  They are the ones that need the most support, and they need that support as quickly as possible.  I will conclude to allow my colleagues to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100058#MMM00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519242300,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I want to begin by commending Deputy McConologue for bringing forward this very important motion.  As we all know, the suckler sector is in crisis and is now referred to as the poor relation in Irish agriculture.  It is a sad day when we see that happening.  That has happened because of the lack of intervention, lack of political will and lack of support for the sector.  Hopefully, that will change, and we are all here tonight to say that it has to change.  These family farms need adequate supports.  They are adding to our economy.  They are playing a very important role in our country, and it has to change.<\/p><p>As we all know, the prospect of Ireland maintaining a viable suckler farming sector is diminishing.  More and more marts host suckler dispersal sales.  While nationally there has been a 6% decline in herd size since the abolition of milk quotas, some counties have experienced\u00a0 greater losses.  As an increasing number of farmers liquidate their stocks to finance a switch to dairy, there is a concern that, without intervention, our quality beef production industry may come under serious threat.<\/p><p>Despite the myth, beef from the dairy industry will not salvage the red meat sector.  With dairy cows now producing 50% more milk than 30 years ago, sucklers are not being replaced in the milk sector by the same number of cows.  It is clear that beyond 2020, the Common Agricultural Policy must include measures which allow for a degree of re-coupling which, in essence, means the reintroduction of headage payments for sucklers.  Given that the value of the Irish beef export market is calculated at &euro;2.5 billion and that the United Kingdom is the largest importer, there is merit in developing an intervention which seeks to mitigate the anticipated impact of Brexit on sales.  The phased introduction of a payment to reach the proposed threshold of &euro;200 direct support for these farmers would bring the subsidy in line with that currently being paid to French farmers.<\/p><p>Whether the current exodus from the beef market and transition into dairy is short-term or long-term remains to be seen, but what is evident is that sustaining the sector at this time and alleviating the hardship on small farmers is unattainable without a headage payment.<\/p><p>Ten thousand jobs are created by the beef sector, which means that any major decline in the industry will be detrimental for the people involved who depend on it.  The <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>recently reported that there has been a &euro;177 per head drop in the level of funding for sucker farmers in the past decade.

The fact that they are small farmers means they do not get the attention or the support they deserve to remain on their lands.  Many of these small family farm sucklers are based in the west and the south west.  Obviously, the type of land is very marginal in many cases.  We underestimate the contribution they make to our economy, and in particular to the processors, who are huge beneficiaries of the suckler farm.

Can the Minister imagine the social consequences for rural Ireland if the suckler farm is gone off our landscape?<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there is a huge debate around the effects of Brexit, in particular, the opening up of the British market to the likes of Brazilian beef and so forth and how that will affect producers here.  They are talking about a 16% reduction in income.  A 16% reduction on &euro;13,000 a year would be catastrophic.  That needs to be taken into account, not least in terms of the beef we know and the standards we have set ourselves within the EU regarding traceability from conception to the table.  That will no longer be the case, and that is what the Irish farming organisations will have to compete with.<\/p>  <p>  During the next negotiation it is essential that every effort is made to try to ensure there will be a subsidy for each suckler farmer and each sucker cow, and &euro;200 a head is small money when we consider the social consequences for rural Ireland.  It is important to have that in terms of the survival of rural Ireland.  The onus is on all of us here, and in particular the Government and the Minister, to ensure that is attainable.  We, in Sinn F&eacute;in, did our sums on that and worked it out in our pre-budget submission, which the Minister probably has read.  They show clearly that for the first 15 cows, there is a subsidy of &euro;200 a head for the calf.  That is attainable, and the Minister will find it in our submission.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy McConalogue for bringing this motion before the House.  There is a tendency within the political establishment, and certainly within the economic establishment, to say that big is great, that it is all about getting bigger and that the small person is cannon fodder and should be forgotten.  However, we have to stand up and fight for the small farmer because that is how we will be judged.  We will not be judged by erasing rural Ireland or the small suckler farmers.  If 50% of them go, that leaves 37,500.  If they go off the land, can the Minister see the consequences for rural Ireland?  Can he see the effect it will have on the local economies in rural Ireland?  Can he visualise the importance of their contribution?  In his submission the Minister said that every &euro;1 generates &euro;4.  I do not know if that is true, but it certainly generates a lot more than &euro;1 when it is circulated within our rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  It is about time the Government stood up and ensured a headage payment for each suckler cow to ensure the survival of the family suckler farm.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The onus is on each and every one of us to make sure of that.  It is up to us to hold the Minister to account and it is up to him and the Government to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100059#NNN00300","speaker":"1317","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519242900,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I will concentrate on the importance of the Mercosur negotiations.  If their outcome and that of Brexit are not successful from our perspective, it is conceivable that our beef industry will be obliterated.  Ireland's interest in the EU-Mercosur talks is clearly centred on beef.  Irish farmers are understandably concerned that the EU may grant significant access to the EU for Mercosur beef.  At present, the EU imports 247,000 tonnes of beef from Mercosur countries, representing three quarters of total beef imports.  The EU has offered to allow an additional 70,000 tonnes of imports although the trade Commissioner, Ms Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, seems willing to raise the offer to 100,000 tonnes.  Mercosur, on the other hand, is demanding access for an additional 200,000 tonnes.  Mercosur negotiators have argued that the additional 70,000 tonnes the EU seems willing to offer represents just two hamburgers per year for each EU citizen.  As an average beef carcass yields only 12% of prime cuts, however, that 70,000 tonnes will require the slaughter of 600,000 tonnes of beef.  That is actually greater than Ireland's total beef exports of 535,000 tonnes.  While 70,000 tonnes might seem insignificant in an EU beef market of 7 million tonnes, Bord Bia points out that it will create significant competition for Ireland's high-quality beef cuts in the EU market.  The EU's own research shows that increasing beef imports from Mercosur countries could reduce beef prices by 60%.  Since we in Ireland export 90% of the beef we produce, the impact on Irish beef production would be greater.  Increased Mercosur imports could lead to a 30% reduction in beef prices of &euro;1 per kilogram.  That would cost Irish beef farmers approximately &euro;500 million per annum.<\/p>  <p>  In Mercosur countries the regulation of beef production is minimal.  Animal diseases like foot and mouth disease remain prevalent.  Most Mercosur countries lack tagging, traceability or movement control systems for livestock and, as a result, cannot guarantee origin or food safety.  These countries use branding as the main means of identification, which undermines the credibility of any certification process for beef exports into the EU.  Many drugs, including some antibiotics and insecticides, which are banned in the EU are cleared for legal use in Mercosur countries with no controls on purchases or withdrawal periods.  In addition, illegal drugs like hormones and clenbuterol are widely available and used in South American beef production.  Most Mercosur beef is produced on huge ranches on which workers receive low pay and have poor working conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Irish beef is produced on natural pasture whereas much of the pasture on which Brazilian beef is produced consists of land which was once rainforest, the clearance of which contributed greatly to climate change.  The clearing of Amazonian rainforest accounts for 75% of Brazil&rsquo;s contribution to global warming with 70% of the clearances being attributable to cattle ranching.  Irish beef production systems are between two and four times more efficient than those in South America in terms of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions when land use changes are considered.  Domestic EU beef production is far more sustainable in terms of carbon and water, with greenhouse gas emissions from Irish suckler beef production estimated at approximately a quarter of emissions from Brazil.  While the EU purports to be concerned about the environmental impact of trade, it seems inconsistent to replace sustainable EU beef production for European consumers with products from South America which have a much higher carbon footprint.<\/p>  <p>  While imports of beef to the EU from Mercosur countries are subject to EU food safety standards, the lower labour costs and environmental conditions will continue to give Mercosur producers a cost advantage.  That must be considered when deciding what quota of beef imports will be allowed.  The most effective way to protect EU beef producers while allowing some market access for Mercosur producers would be to negotiate tariff rate quotas.  Under a tariff rate quota system, a limited amount of beef would be imported at low tariff while imports above that level would be subject to significantly higher targets.  The threat to the Irish beef industry from increased Mercosur imports would be considerable if the UK were to remain within the EU.  Brexit has added a further threat, however.  A major argument put forward by Brexiteers in favour of the UK leaving the EU is the possibility of concluding more favourable trade deals with countries or groups of countries.  While this is a very optimistic argument, the possibility that the UK will impose tariffs on EU beef after it leaves cannot be ruled out.  Were the UK to conclude a deal on beef with Mercosur after Brexit, we could find that beef in Newry is half the price it is in Dundalk.  This possibility makes it even more urgent for Ireland to resist any deal with Mercosur on beef which might lower beef prices and farmers' incomes significantly.<\/p>  <p>  Fortunately, Ireland is not alone in opposing a significant increase in Mercosur beef imports.  It should co-operate fully with the other EU member states which oppose the deal.  As the French trade Minister, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said, negotiators should take their time to get the deal right.  Lemoyne said that while France wants an agreement, it will not be rushed into it.  He pointed out that a few years are not significant in negotiations which have been ongoing for 15 years.  He also stated that France wants the EU to recognise that the market has evolved since the talks began.  Lemoyne's views are shared by others, including Belgium, Romania and Slovenia.  Ireland must resist being pressurised to agree a deal which would be very damaging for the beef industry by countries which stand to gain more than we do from an agreement.  The Minister has our solid support to insist that the interests of the Irish and European beef sectors are safeguarded fully and protected in the conduct of the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I hail from a mainly beef production area.  Indeed, my brother is a suckler cow farmer.  Longford-Westmeath is at the very heart of that.  As such, I am aware of a significant decrease in suckler cow numbers in the past four years.  Nationally, beef cow numbers have declined by approximately 6%.  We must be truthful and stop codding here.  The cause of that decline arises from a number of things, including the number of younger farmers in particular who have gone into milk production.  I have seen it happening in my own area and have been warning them about it.  I said it at the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They have opted to switch to dairy or to have integrated calf-to-beef systems.  Large increases have taken place in the eastern and south-eastern counties.  In my county, there has been a 3% drop in the number of suckler cows in the past four years.  Longford has experienced a decline of just over 5% in the same period.  With the removal of milk quotas and a continuing question of profitability, many experts anticipate the decline will be even greater.  The advent of the beef data and genomics programme payment may have helped to stem the exit.  I sat on an agriculture committee when Fianna F&aacute;il nearly stopped the programme, together with the IFA.  Former spokesperson Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was there.  I am 150% behind the programme however.  It is worth approximately &euro;80 to &euro;100 per head but it should be increased to &euro;130 or &euro;140 per head.  That is important because the only way we are going to increase efficiency is through genetic improvements in herds.<\/p>  <p>  For suckler cow farmers, we must cut out this nonsense.  We need to get the price right for them.  Guaranteeing meat yield and higher prices for new grades and carcasses would help to boost suckler cow numbers.  One has to take stock of the reality and start there.  There is a &euro;14 billion hole in the EU budget as a result of Britain leaving, of which &euro;3 billion relates to CAP.  There is a hole in the bucket and the only way to fill it is from individual European member states paying extra.  We will have to pay more.  Even to get them to pay for the &euro;14 billion will be some achievement, in which respect we should not be trying to fool anyone.  I will not fool any farmer.  Farming or other organisations or political parties can do it, but I will not be part of it.  I will tell the truth.  I am only telling the truth to my own brother who is in the game.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100060#OOO00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1519242900,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion which I support fully.  We talk about money.  I tabled a question to the Department of Finance to ask what was given back by agriculture in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  The Department replied that after taking account of capital carryover in the following year, the surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer in 2015 was &euro;57 million and in 2016 it was &euro;231 million.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that 70% of the suckler herd is from Donegal down to Clare and out to Longford.  The reason we are losing cattle numbers is that when one goes to the mart to sell a weanling, the price is not there.  The cow is costing too much.  Unless we put a floor under the price, we are going nowhere.  There was talk about beef genomics.  I heard Deputy Penrose discuss it.  For the export market and to get cattle to Turkey or wherever, we must have the Benson &amp;amp; Hedges coloured Charolais because that is what will make the money.  One has to get &euro;850 to &euro;1,000 for a weanling or one is going nowhere with the suckler herd.  We have to put a floor under the price.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, there were 40,000 herds with fewer than 12 cows.  These are family farms.  When CAP came out, they got shafted because 80% of the money went to 20% of the farmers.  These farmers are not going into it.  One looks at the statistics for the current year and has to ask why we have killed 10,000 more cattle but the tonnage was the same.  It is because we are rearing narrow-arsed cattle that will not pull down the scale.<\/p><p>Whether people like to admit that, it is the reality.  There is a question mark over some of the beef genomics at the moment because of the star rating.  They are looking again at this because some bulls produced four or five calves and some produced 100 calves, but the ones that produced four or five had the higher star rating.  We need to get realistic and produce the product that is required.  Whether we like it or not, the farmer has to have an animal that will pull the scales down or have the shape for export.  They are continental cattle.  If we keep going the way we are going, we will drive the farmer out.  From Donegal down along the west coast right down to Kerry and out as far as Longford - that is where the nucleus is of farmers.  We have to protect them with money.  That is what came back to me from the Department of Finance.

Suckler cow numbers nationwide have declined by 4% according to official statistics from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This comes on the back of vast expansion in the country's dairy sector, particularly after the removal of milk quotas in 2015, since when the dairy herd has increased by 35%.  In Clare the suckler sector is very important, with 70,000 suckler cows compared to 30,000 dairy cows because the land in the west is more suited to the suckler system of farming.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting our farming community is essential to the sustainability of our rural towns and villages and maintaining the fabric of rural society.  To keep suckler farmers sustainable and viable, there needs to be a targeted payments system, particularly for Clare farmers, who are dependent on the suckler trade.  This targeted payment system should be there to support suckler farmers.  The cost of maintaining a suckler cow is almost the same as the price one gets for selling the calf at the age of nine to 12 months.  As there is very little money in the sector, supports are needed.  The motion calls for a targeted payment of &euro;200 per head, which is in keeping with what the farming organisations are calling for.<\/p>  <p>  Some 5% of our beef production is for home consumption, 50% is for export to the UK market and the remainder is sold around the world to both EU and non-EU countries, in particular live exports to Turkey.  Beef farming is also a major employer and it needs to be supported because it is a very important part of the rural Irish economy.  The beef sector faces two major challenges.  The first is Brexit, which threatens to be the most important challenge because there will be difficulties exporting beef into the UK if tariffs are put on Irish exports.  Second, there will reduced CAP payments of up to 30% due to the loss of payments from the UK.  Additionally, the Mercosur trade agreement threatens to flood the European market with cheap and lower quality beef.  Europe wants to sell goods into the Mercosur trading area, which has some 260 million people, and in return we will be expected to accept South American beef.  We need to keep that to the absolute minimum if we do accept Mercosur beef.  We must also consider how farming is going to deal with meeting the climate change targets which are coming down the road.<\/p>  <p>  We have to prepare our farming community for these eventualities.  Targeted payments are key, as well as supporting CAP payments.  We must plan to support our family farming communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100061#PPP00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1519243500,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on the motion and I want to commend the Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing it forward.  I have to admit I have a conflict of interest as I am a suckler cow farmer.  Going back many years, when I took over the running of the farm, a wise neighbour told me, \"Remember one thing, Collins, farming is from the shoulders up, and not down.\"  My God, was that man ever so right in all of his life.  Like many of my neighbours and friends who were reared in rural Ireland, I foolishly dreamed of working the farm and being able to live off the farm but, like many more, only for having an outside income to fund the farm, that same farm would be gone by now.<\/p>  <p>  Farm incomes have been cut time and again down through the years.  Last year, we saw the grain farmers doing a sit-in at Agriculture House, protesting at the crisis they found themselves in where they had been cut year after year.  In my view, it was scandalous that they were left there, day after day, without any acknowledgement.  I am particularly unhappy that in my county of Cork, where there were 86 applicants for compensation among grain farmers - although in my view it was poor compensation - only 32 of those farmers have been paid to date.  This proves the compensation was over-complicated and very difficult to qualify for.  The milk sector has gone through a good year, which was welcome after many years of hardship.  However, as we all know, dairy farmers have huge costs, which leads to a lot of stress on farmers.<\/p>  <p>  The Mercosur trade deal is make or break for Irish suckler farmers.  In the current Mercosur trade talks, the EU&rsquo;s latest offers would see Mercosur countries being allowed to export 70,000 tonnes of beef into the EU, while we are aware that the Mercosur countries are looking to be allowed to export 100,000 tonnes per year.  Even at the figure of 70,000, this will have a detrimental effect on European and Irish beef producers.  There is also a danger that it will expose customers to health risks.<\/p>  <p>  The suckler farmers have been continuously hit for years, with no voice in the political system working for them.  A recent report by Teagasc states that the price of weanlings was down 4% last year.  That is the difference between sinking and swimming for many suckler farmers.  Payments for many farmers have been held up, in particular with GLAS and its so-called computer glitches.  Many farmers are being unfairly treated and refused payments due to fires having been started on their lands due to no fault of their own.  The area of natural constraint payment was cut in 2008 and that cut has not yet been restored ten years later.  I would support any introduction of a &euro;200 payment for a suckler cow grant.  If this is to be introduced, however, the Minister should stop codding Irish farmers.  If he is going to give some kind of payment to farmers, he should stop complicating it like the grain compensation and everything else, making it almost impossible for farmers to get the compensation.  That kind of a system has to stop.  The Minister should simplify the payment.  He should work with the farmers, not against them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100061#PPP00500","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1519243500,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of suckler farmers right around the western seaboard.

If the calves are not going to be looked after, we are at a crossroads.  I hear the vibes around the circuit that the suckler farmer is finding it very hard to continue and is very likely to cut down numbers or to get out of it altogether.  I have no problem in telling the people on the eastern side of the country that the weanlings are coming from the west.  They are coming into the mart of the Minister's town of Macroom and into Skibbereen, Kenmare, Milltown and Cahirciveen and that is where the drovers from up the country are getting their beef.  If those fellows are not going to be looked after, they will disappear and it will be very hard to get them back because there is an awful lot involved in calving a cow and rearing the calf.  Many farmers are experiencing challenges due to the volatility in the market, the difficulty in farming conditions, bad weather and losses.  I am a suckler farmer myself.  I bought a farm 25 years ago and in ten years I paid off the loan, but if I bought it today, I would not pay off the loan.  With the cost of the land and what is being made from calves at present, it would be gone in a couple of years.<\/p>  <p>  Some 35 or 36 years ago weanlings were making &pound;700 to &pound;750 but, today, they are making &euro;700 to &euro;750, so there is something wrong.

The cost of fertiliser and feed are going up every year but the price of the weanlings in the marts is not going up.<\/p><p>Something needs to be done to protect them and ensure that they continue because if we do not have the sucklers we will not have the beef down the line.

Deputy McConalogue's proposal this evening relates to stopping the export of four-legged animals from the west, which is full of substance and should be listened to and not dismissed in the manner that I heard Deputy Pat Deering do earlier in a broadcast this evening, forgetting his role as Chairman of the agriculture committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100062#QQQ01600","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1519244100,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I was speaking facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100062#QQQ01700","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1519244100,"counter":721,"content":"<p>The Minister is travelling the country at the moment, which I welcome.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, is in Mayo this evening listening to the stories from the core of Irish farming.  The Minister will know that in many ways it stands at a cliff edge at this time.  We face the challenge of Mercosur and the decline in quality which that might bring with it; Brexit and the decline that represents in our main market and also the detrimental effect that will have on the CAP budget, which still underpins the entire rural economy whether we like it or not.  Then there are the various fluctuations in price.  Everyone here has praised the dairymen this evening but we all know that could change as quickly as an outbreak in China or any of our main markets.  It is unpredictable and unsustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at the Government's response to the motion, its actions and its standing by departmental under-spends year after year while there are also delays in payments, it strikes me that the Minister does not understand the severity or urgency of the challenge which is what tonight is about.  Tonight's proposals are about putting a foundation on our beef industry which is one of our green flag industries, one which successive Governments and various bodies put huge resources behind promoting, one whose quality and standards we are very proud of, one where our farmers are put the pin of their collar every day to maintain those standards, inspection after inspection, cross-compliance and every other thing.  Yet, here we are with a substantial proposal to put a foundation under that industry and say we are taking it seriously and it is being ignored and dismissed.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge will involve supporting the motion and putting in place a review of the underspend in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It does not make sense for that underspend to continue year after year.  There are difficulties around late claims, especially on the capital side, but why does this happen year after year?  As noted earlier, we were here around this time last year with an emergency motion around tillage farmers.  Very little came of that.  We are here tonight over sucklers: we could be here again about dairy.  Nevertheless, the issues I receive in my office relate to payments that are consistently delayed and difficulties in getting them.  I take this opportunity to commend the staff who work in the Minister's Oireachtas unit who go beyond the call of duty each time to assist Members but that should not be necessary.  We should not have to do that.  The Minister should take on board the seriousness of this motion and the serious crisis that faces the suckler sector, particularly on the west coast.  He should put his money where his mouth is in terms of his commitment to farming and support farmers on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100062#QQQ01800","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1519244100,"counter":722,"content":"<p>The Minister's constituency neighbours my own and he will know the importance of the agricultural sector to the mid-west, to Limerick and to my constituency.  There is in excess of 5,900 farms in County Limerick, of which 2,500 are less than 30 hectares with an average farm size of 35 hectares.  We rely heavily on farming as a livelihood and many farm families rely on the income derived from farming.  They are under huge pressure, as the Minister knows.  The greatest issue in farming now is uncertainty about Brexit, Mercosur and the other extraneous factors such as the loan sale in Permanent TSB which will affect many farmsteads.  There is also the issue of insurance costs.  All these outside factors feed in.  If tonight's motion does anything, I would like to be able to tell farmers in County Limerick, who rely heavily on the suckler sector because we have a lot of marginal land especially in west Limerick, where the income derived from it is crucial that the Minister could support the &euro;200 payment and carry out the review of the rural development programme.  The underspend in relation to GLAS is 78%, the TAMS has a 92% underspend and the hen harrier designated land has a 100% underspend, which I know has to kick off.

In putting down this motion, my colleague, Deputy McConalogue, is making a clear statement on the future of the suckler scheme.  The cost of the suckler farming scheme is now a serious matter.  This proposal of &euro;200 per suckler cow would be most beneficial.  Looking at my constituency, in Elphin there is a fantastic mart where farmers come twice weekly.  That mart and those farmers keep that little town going.  There is very little else in it.  It is the very same story in Castlerea in County Roscommon.  The life brought to the town of Castlerea by the mart and the farmers is significant.  It is the same in Roscommon town.  Looking at the Galway end of my constituency, as Deputy Anne Rabbitte will know, in Ballinasloe and Mountbellew most of the farmers are suckler farmers and they desperately need a boost now.  Remember too that in many of those towns there are farming businesses such as machinery businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I must cut my contribution short but I urge the Minister to take this on board.  This a very sensible proposal from Fianna F&aacute;il.  We need it in the west and along the west coast.

The almost 1 million suckler cow herd is pivotal to supporting the local economy in rural Ireland and Cavan-Monaghan is no different.  Every &euro;1 support to suckler farmers generates over &euro;4 of economic activity in rural areas and should not be under-estimated.  Suckler farm families underpin annual Irish beef exports worth &euro;2.5 billion.  However, suckler farmers' average incomes are below &euro;13,000 and they are fully dependent on CAP supports to maintain their livelihoods.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has refused at every point to examine all options to introduce a &euro;200 payment per suckler cow in the current and future CAP.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy McConalogue have been instrumental in the political campaign for this key policy.  We will continue to push for its delivery.  I compliment my colleague on his motion urging the Minister to review the current underspend accruing across several areas in the 2014-2020 rural development programme scheme and reporting back to the Oireachtas within two months with a roadmap towards meeting those targets as the underspend could be well utilised for the suckler and other vulnerable sectors in agriculture.<\/p><p>The underspend in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has soared, as the Minister will be aware, to &euro;186 million over the past two years while several of the 2014-2020 rural development programme, RDP, schemes are now on course to underspend significantly.  Fianna F&aacute;il has exposed how the current green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which we all have heard talked about on many occasions in this Chamber, is on track to leave farmers missing out on payments of over &euro;400 million up until 2020.  It is an appalling situation, given the severe cashflow crisis that is facing farmers on a daily basis.  Such moneys are needed to spend in the current RDP window.<\/p> <p> I need not re-emphasise how Cavan-Monaghan is so dependent on this sector and with Brexit looming large and darkly across that sector too, one area on which the Minister needs to focus his attentions is the suckler farmers' income.  The Government must immediately seek EU recognition of these and request funding supports, including CAP, to support the market disturbances funds.<\/p> <p> I would ask the Minister to support this practical motion which will deliver for farmers on the ground.  The Minister has the money, as he will be aware, in the Department.  There are underspends in many of the different areas.  Here is an opportunity.  It is a reasonable, practical measure that the Minister can put in place and I would hope that he would support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100062#QQQ02100","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519244700,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McConalogue and his colleagues for tabling this motion.  The number of contributors to the debate is indicative of the seriousness of the issue.  The motion touches on all the challenges we face, from Mercosur to Brexit to CAP.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to ensuring that the national suckler herd is supported with strong direct payments, I am also anxious to ensure that the productivity and efficiency of the suckler herd continues to improve.  The better farm programme is a prime example of how supports can improve both efficiency and profitability.  Results from the programme show five star or higher genetic merit suckler cows calved younger, went back in calf earlier and produced heavier weanlings, when compared to one star or low genetic merit cows.  This data is not research farm data, but ICBF analysis of data from farmer participants in the programme which clearly shows the benefit in increasing the genetic merit of the national suckler herd - the key objective of the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  Such a model of ensuring that supports drive both economic and environmental efficiency is one that, in my view, represents the best way forward for supporting our national suckler herd in the future, in line with the Food Wise strategy for the sustainable growth of the agrifood sector as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to any potential additional funding over and above existing supports to suckler farmers and the only possible sources of such funding.  A fully Exchequer-funded support scheme would require approval by the European Commission under state aid regulations and would need to comply with our obligations under the WTO rules.  Second, while there have been calls for the use of savings within the existing rural development programme, RDP, to be used for additional supports, I wish to restate and make absolutely clear that there are no surplus funds available within the rural development programme above and beyond the funding already allocated, which has been committed to existing schemes within the rural development programme.  Finally, any allocation of funding under Pillar I of the CAP would in principle have required a linear reduction of an estimated 18% to all existing farmers basis payment scheme payments for redistribution.  In fact, the deadline for any such change to the Pillar I scheme in the current round has already passed.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make it clear that Ireland will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible post 2020.  There will be budgetary challenges however, arising not only from the United Kingdom's decision to exit the EU, but also from the need to address other EU policy challenges such as those relating to migration, security and growth.  On the Taoiseach's comments, which Deputy Burke referred to earlier, in the context of funding of a CAP where he stated in the European Parliament that Ireland was open to the issue of contributing additional funds to the Common Agricultural Policy, we need to be prudent around how we prosecute this debate because it would be rather foolish of us to have our hand up early indicating a willingness to increase our contribution if the final shape of the Common Agricultural Policy meant that such increased contribution from us was being spent elsewhere rather than domestically, and we need to be careful in that issue.<\/p>  <p>  The case to be made to member states and European taxpayers for a strong CAP must be based on strong public good arguments.  I will continue arguing strongly that the CAP provides vital support for the rural economy and society, provides a range of environmental benefits and supports an EU farming model that supports the production of high quality, safe food on family farms.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP post 2020.  However, I am strongly of the view that any such payments should not merely be supports for the sake of supports - suckler farmers must be supported and encouraged to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure everyone I will work hard with my European counterparts to ensure that the CAP budget post-2020 provides a solid and effective foundation for the development of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I draw all Deputies attention to the current public consultation on the future of the CAP post-2020 which is being undertaken with a view to allowing all stakeholders in the next CAP to provide their thoughts and suggestions as to how elements of the next CAP are structured.  I would encourage all stakeholders within the sector to contribute to this public consultation which will be an important part of the framing of the future CAP in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the strength of the national suckler herd, according to the CSO June livestock census figures for the years 2010 to 2017, the number of suckler cows present in the national herd has reduced from approximately 1.15 million cows to 1.08 million cows, a reduction of approximately 6%.  Since the removal of milk quotas in 2015, it was anticipated by many observers there would be a substantial reduction in the national suckler herd.  While there has been a movement from sucklers to dairying in traditionally strong dairy counties, the extent of the overall reduction in the size of the herd is much less than anticipated.  At county level, suckler cow numbers in Galway and Mayo, the two largest counties by herd size, have reduced by only 2% and 4%, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2010.  By contrast, suckler numbers in Cork, the county with the third largest suckler herd, have reduced by 15% over the same period, most likely due to competition from dairying.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to suckler farming and will continue to ensure appropriate supports are targeted towards suckler farmers into the future.  It is a sector that makes an enormous contribution to Ireland's rural economy, and a contribution which I see at first hand on a daily basis.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the comments of all contributors to the motion this evening and I can reassure Deputies that we have a common goal of supporting the sustainable development of the national suckler herd into the future, particularly in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy debate, which is under way, and determining the shape of the budget post-2020.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal in more detail with the issue of a &euro;200 suckler cow payment and how this would be funded.  It simply is not an option because of WTO and state aid rules to have that funded from the Exchequer.  The thrust of what Deputy McConalogue is saying - we have had this debate in the Chamber on a number of occasions - is that the capacity is there if only the political will were there to redirect funding under the rural development programme to the suckler cow scheme.  By way of exposing what I think is the fallacy of that argument, I would point out that in 2008 - I generally prefer to look forward rather than look backwards - when disadvantaged area payments were slashed by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government and when installation aid was abolished, the underspend in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was &euro;150 million.  They are unconnected in many respects because the &euro;150 million, as is the case in schemes today, was contractually committed to farmers under various schemes.  The essence of the underspend argument is that somehow the Department should renege on the contractual commitments of funds under the rural development programme to the various schemes under Pillar II, be it areas of natural constraint, ANC, GLAS, knowledge transfer, beef data and genomics and targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, or investments for various initiatives that can be drawn down under several subheads, and redirect that funding into a suckler cow scheme.<\/p><p>I will not do that.  I will not break a contract to a farmer who is on GLAS or TAMS to shore up another payment, be it the beef data and genomics programme or any other way of getting payments to suckler farmers.<\/p> <p> What is equally unclear from the motion is whether we are talking about a coupled payment or a payment under BDGP.  It should be remembered that BDGP is about income forgone in terms of the farmer's commitment to it.  Like all Administrations prior to me, I am adamant that we will not let a brown penny of EU money not be drawn down for the benefit of the Irish economy and under the rural development programme or any other heading.  We have a track record, as do all other Administrations, of drawing down every last penny that is available, and we are at present in the vanguard at EU level of drawing down funding.  Our drawdown at present is approximately 40% of our rural development programme.  The average across the remaining member states is just north of 20%.  We will draw down every last penny in funding.  I reassure people that we are doing a great many things to try to support suckler farmers, and I am open, in the context of the CAP post 2020, to seeing how we can provide additional supports.  However, a coupled payment will cut right across every initiative we have taken to improve the genetic merit of the herd and to liberate farmers from the compulsion to have the numbers to be able to guarantee drawdown of the payment.  We liberate them from that and let them make more commercially focused decisions.  However, if we introduce a coupled payment, it will undermine all the progress we have made to improve the genetic merit of the herd.  This would be a huge mistake at a time when one of the biggest challenges we on the agriculture side face is to reduce our emissions.<\/p> <p> I accept the bona fides of the motion.  Everyone who has contributed to the debate wants the optimum outcome for the sector.  It is a very important sector socially, in the context of family farm structure and outside the farm gate, and the processing industry and foreign earnings and so on are very important.  However, we need to be honest about how we can deliver for it.  The most effective way we can do so is in the context of the CAP post 2020.  I am acutely aware, having attended some of the public consultations, of the strength of feeling, particularly in the west, on the redistribution requirement in respect of scarce resources.  We will have to take this on board.  The spirit of this debate is that this sector needs additional consideration, and I am open to that in the context of the 2020 CAP negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100063#RRR00200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519245300,"counter":728,"content":"<p>We move back to the Fianna F&aacute;il slot, for which there is a total of ten minutes.

The lure of dairy farming has seen suckler cow numbers fall by up to 20% in some eastern and south-eastern counties.  In my county of Waterford we have seen the sharpest decrease in suckler numbers, a reduction of 18.9% since 2014 or a loss of a fifth of the herd.  This is a decline from 22,400 to 18,240 in three years.  This is substantial and is an extremely worrying trend.  The suckler sector faces threats on many fronts, with successive Fine Gael-led Governments found wanting.  Suckler farmers are being let down, with the Government accepting at least 70,000 extra tonnes of South American Mercosur beef into the EU.  The timing of this could not be any worse for farmers, with Brexit having the potential to place tariffs on half of all our beef exports.  As the Minister knows, 50% of all our beef is exported to the UK, and with the uncertainty of Brexit, I believe the numbers will fall even further.  Many young farmers are opting to switch to dairying or calf-to-beef systems.  Why is this?  Why are they turning away from sucklers?  To me, the answer is quite clear: they simply cannot make it pay.  While suckler farmers underpin our &euro;2.5 billion in beef exports, they generate average incomes below &euro;13,000 each year and they are fully dependent on CAP supports to maintain their livelihoods.  Farmers and rural communities depend and rely on this sector.  There is no doubt that money earned locally is spent locally.

I am very much in touch with farmers and I know that if suckler farmers do not get some help, specifically a suckler grant of at least &euro;200, they will not survive.  There is a &euro;2.5 billion industry here that will collapse.  The farmers are put to the pin of their collar.  They cannot go dairying because the land is so scattered.  They can survive with suckler cows, and most of them are working as well.  Even at that, they are struggling to survive and to keep their families and keep running their lands.<\/p>  <p>  I just do not fully understand the beef data and genomics scheme.  It is said we will reduce greenhouse gasses.  I do not know the difference between a Friesian cow and a suckler cow or how this greenhouse gas will be reduced.

I know from my 35 years spent in the butchering business what a Friesian cow will produce and what a good suckler cow will produce, whether it is Aberdeen Angus, Hereford, Charolais or Limousin.  There is absolutely no comparison in the wide earthly world to what a Friesian cow will produce.  This is wrong.  We will destroy our beef industry.

All commitments should be honoured and followed through, and we believe this is very important.  For a man who does not want to break any contracts in the rural development programme schemes, unfortunately as a Minister he has shown himself to be very willing to break his Government's promises on the overall spend there would be on those schemes.  The biggest area where there is an underspend is GLAS, which is why we tabled a motion calling for a review.<\/p>  <p>  I have the press release from when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coveney, announced the GLAS scheme.  We do not need to go any further than the headline, which states \"Coveney Announces &euro;1.4Bbn GLAS Scheme to Open Monday\".  That was in February 2015.  An explanatory note at the end outlines how the money was to be allocated to GLAS over the lifetime of the programme period to 2020.  We are now four years into the seven-year rural development programme, and it is quite clear at this stage from replies to parliamentary questions I have received that the maximum spend there can be under the GLAS scheme, given the participants and the amount of time it has been opened, is &euro;1 billion.  This brings it to 2022, when everybody who is in GLAS is to be out of it.  That is &euro;400 million less than the former Minister promised farmers.  Our motion calls for this underspend, the promise and the commitments on other rural development programme schemes to be assessed and reviewed, because it is time the Government's bluff was called on this, given the fact it is failing to deliver on the promises it made.  It got the headlines at the time, with &euro;1.4 billion for GLAS, but it will deliver &euro;400 million less than this.  We will hold the Minister to this.<\/p>  <p>  There will be an underspend in many of the schemes, and as part of this motion we are seeking that underspend be put on the table after which we will assess how it can best be spent and how the beef data genomics programme can be increased as part of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is crucial that we find a mechanism to deliver &euro;200 for suckler cows.  The Minister is teeing us up to accept 70,000 tonnes of beef in the Mercosur agreement, and the Minister did not even mention this agreement in his contribution.  The Minister needs to go to Europe to seek adjustment funding for the impact this will have on our beef sector, being the most exposed agrisector in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit, we need to see additional funds which recognise the potential impact it might have.  This is something the Minister needs to set as an objective to try to achieve it.  We will work with the Minister.  All Members in the House are agreed on this being an objective, but in the short term we need to see the beef data genomics programme increased and have the rural development programme underspend assessed.  Under the CAP we have to find a mechanism to support the many farming families throughout the country who need that support to be able to sustain the Irish countryside.  I commend the motion to the House and I thank everyone for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022100065#TTT00200","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519245900,"counter":739,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519245900,"counter":740,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 February 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
