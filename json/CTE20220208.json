I am accompanied by officials from the Department.<\/p> <p>  The total provision for the Department in 2022 is &euro;858 million, comprising &euro;700 million of capital, excluding capital carryover of &euro;58 million, and &euro;168 million for current spending.  This represents a 19% increase over 2021 and reflects the significant scale of ambition in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a climate-neutral, circular and connected economy and society.  Before I begin, I would like to bring to the committee&rsquo;s attention the updated programme and subhead structure in the Revised Estimates.  These changes better reflect the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy, Le Ch&eacute;ile 23, which sets out our vision for the three-year period from 2021 to 2023.<\/p> <p>  I will now highlight some key initiatives across the environment and climate action, energy transformation, and circular economy programme areas.  The Estimates for programme D, the connectivity and communications programme, will be considered by the Select Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow.  Programme A covers climate action and environmental leadership, including licensing and enforcement; monitoring, analysis and reporting on the environment; research and development; and implementation of climate action measures.  Programme A provides &euro;41.6 million in operational and capital funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to deliver its range of functions to protect the environment.  The EPA&rsquo;s 2022 allocation includes funding for additional staff resources in the Climate Change Advisory Council secretariat.  Some &euro;16.8 million is being allocated for environmental and climate research, including &euro;10 million for the EPA&rsquo;s programme of research and &euro;3.2 million for the climate action and modelling group to provide technical support for wider climate and environment policy development, as well as the implementation of the climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  A further &euro;15 million is being allocated for contributions towards international climate commitments, which will contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s goal to more than double the annual funding for developing countries to tackle climate change to &euro;225 million by 2025.  Some &euro;11 million is being provided for the national just transition fund, as well as a further &euro;21 million for expenditure associated with the EU just transition fund, including programme design, establishment of the programme authorities and initial programme expenditure once the programme has been finalised and approved by the European Commission.<\/p> <p>  Programme B, the energy transformation programme, supports Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for a net-zero emissions future by delivering energy-efficient measures across the residential, public and business sectors and by enabling the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure.  Some &euro;21.47 million is being provided to cover the operational costs of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, including an extra &euro;3.1 million for additional staff resources required to deliver its programmes.  Some &euro;46 million is being provided for improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy in businesses and across the public sector.  Some &euro;202 million in carbon tax revenue is being allocated to fund the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and &euro;109 million of that allocation will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty.<\/p> <p>  The 2021 climate action plan has set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 or carbon equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of 2030.  The national retrofit plan sets out the policies and measures that will be implemented in order to deliver on these targets.  The plan indicates that new and improved SEAI grants will be a central element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to encourage homeowners to upgrade their homes.  In this regard, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is today bringing proposals to Cabinet that will represent the most significant reform of the SEAI support schemes since they were first put in place.  Subject to Government approval, the Minister will announce details of the changes later today.  A new low-cost loan scheme for residential retrofitting will also be announced in mid-2022.  This programme, funded in part by the Exchequer and in part by the EU, will enable credit institutions to offer loans at reduced interest rates, making energy upgrades more affordable.<\/p> <p>  In response to the exceptional rise in energy prices, the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, which is currently going through the Houses, aims to establish a scheme for a once-off &euro;100 electricity costs emergency benefit payment to each domestic electricity account.  The scheme will apply to all domestic electricity accounts, including pay-as-you-go customers.  Approximately 2.1 million domestic account holders will benefit from this exceptional payment.  The cost of the scheme will be funded by the Department, with additional Exchequer funds to be made available by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Work is under way between both Departments to ensure that the necessary funding will be available when the scheme becomes operational.<\/p> <p>  Programme C, circular economy development, supports the transition to a circular economy, protecting and restoring our environment through sustainable resource use.  Some &euro;98 million is being allocated to the programme in 2022 to tackle environmental damage, manage waste, safeguard our natural resources and support the move to a circular economy.  This includes &euro;26 million of funding for the remediation of environmentally-degraded landfill sites.  Within this allocation, &euro;14 million is being allocated for the final phase of the remediation of the landfill at Kerdiffstown in County Kildare.  The programme also includes expenditure of &euro;2.5 million to target waste prevention, segregation and recycling and &euro;7.7 million for waste enforcement activities by local authorities.  Some &euro;13 million is being provided for Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, services, including the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  Geological mapping data from the Tellus project inform land planning and usage while INFOMAR is Ireland&rsquo;s national seabed survey and provides data to underpin the Irish marine development plan, Harnessing our Ocean Wealth.  Funding of &euro;33.5 million is being allocated to Inland Fisheries for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries resource.  This includes an allocation of &euro;2.9 million towards the Loughs Agency, a North-South body that is co-funded on a 50:50 basis by the Department and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.<\/p> <p>  Appropriations-in-aid are income receipts of the Department other than from the Exchequer and they total &euro;10.5 million.  Receipts mainly comprise mining and petroleum income of &euro;5 million and also include &euro;3 million in receipts from additional superannuation contributions on public service remuneration, and GSI income of &euro;300,000.<\/p> <p>  I am very happy to take questions from the committee members on any details relating to the Estimates for programmes A to C within my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022020800002#C00100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.

I will be interested to hear his comment on the impact indicators he has shown relating to greenhouse gas emissions in the full Estimates statement.  We had a 4% decline in emissions in 2019 and a 3.5% decline in 2020.  Clearly, the Covid-19 pandemic influenced the 2020 returns, but even with that 3.5% is surprisingly low for that year.

He is correct that there was a significant reduction in 2020 compared with 2019.  The question is to what extent that was caused by the pandemic and the obvious reduction in economic activity across sectors.  Clearly, there was a major drop in transport emissions during that year.  There was a reduction in 2021, but there was also a rebound.  We do not have figures yet for that.  We are trying to maintain economic growth to allow people to continue to enjoy their lives while their emissions are reducing.  The year, 2020, was an exceptional year and a lockdown is not the route to cutting emissions for the decade. <\/p> <p>  We know that our target is a 51% cut by 2030 and that we will not achieve it with an exact 7.5% cut from one year to the next.  That is not the nature of things.  We will have deeper cuts in the second half of the decade compared with the first half.  We had an exceptional cut in 2020, which will probably be followed by a rebound in 2021.  I expect emissions to be higher overall in 2021 compared with 2020; I think my officials will agree with me.  We do not yet have an estimate for that, but we will be back on a downward slope in 2022.<\/p> <p>  The next question related to the just transition commission and when it will be put on a statutory basis.

I understand progress has been made.  Deputy Whitmore raised the case of a particular company and I understand it obtained a determination in the end.  However, it should not take years to reach decisions.  Inquiries were made into why things were taking so long.  We made sure there was sufficient funding in place this year.  There should be better communication with those applying for determinations of licences and there should not be a situation where forms are not correctly filled in, information is not available and applicants need to go back and forth.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to say that we have to ensure the determinations are made carefully.  For example, a large number of houses will probably be demolished because they were defective or had mica blocks in them.  It is important that the waste material from that demolition does not re-enter the construction stream to be used a second time and that a determination is not made that this is a useful material for load-bearing walls or suchlike.  It is not just a case of rapidly agreeing that everything that needs to go back into recirculation should be licensed as such.  That said, the system needs to be sped up.

I ask the Minister of State to speak to that, please.<\/p> <p>  On outputs, the target for the number of lower income households provided with energy efficiency upgrades is lower for this year than last.  In 2021, the target was 5,800 and in 2022 it is 4,500.  I know there is a note on that but I ask the Minister of State to speak on it.  It states that the number of homes is lower than target for the previous year but this is because of a shift to deeper energy efficiency measures resulting in more energy and carbon dioxide savings.  I raise that in the context of the national retrofitting plan that we will hopefully see later today.  Sinn F&eacute;in specifically asked questions around the options to achieve reductions in emissions.  For example, what is the difference between 20,000 houses moving to a BER C2 versus 20,000 houses moving to a BER B2?  Is a different approach by the Department planned for in these figures?

That is a very good question.  To say we will retrofit 20,000 homes without saying if those will be deep or shallow retrofits is not clear.  We need a way to account for them.  As the information note puts it, a reduction in the number of homes retrofitted could still lead to an overall increase in the amount of carbon dioxide saved.  We need to be clear to each other in explaining what is being done.<\/p> <p>  I expect there will be increased funding for shallow retrofits this year.  This will be for people who are unwilling to embark on a whole deep retrofit, even with a large grant or loan, but are prepared to do it in steps.

That would leave 491,000 houses that still have to be brought up to that B2 level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022020800002#G01300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>What was the first question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022020800002#G01400","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Essentially, what will be available for those households that do not meet the eligibility criteria under the warmer homes programme but will not have the money upfront to pay and will need to get a low-cost loan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022020800002#G01500","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The timeframe for this is the middle of this year.  The target interest rate is 3.5%.  It fits into the loan category of the available green loans, and there are green loans from the post office at 4.5%.  If people have a mortgage, which many do, they can refinance and probably get it at a lower rate than the 3.5%, perhaps at between 2% and 3%.  It is to fit into that category of loan.  The idea is that the loan will not be secured on people&rsquo;s property and it is a non-recourse loan.  The idea is that it covers the portion of the retrofit that people cannot afford or that is not covered by the grant, assuming people do not have their own resources to pay for it.  Not everybody is going to do a deep retrofit, so it is possible for people to do a much smaller retrofit starting from around &euro;3,000, where the person is only putting up &euro;600 of the capital themselves.  The loan could be as low as that and it is over a period of years and is a non-recourse loan.  The idea is that people are not frozen out because they have to take on some giant amount of money.  They can do it step by step.<\/p> <p>  It will be mid-2022 before that loan scheme is ready.   The idea is also that the loan is to some extent guaranteed by the State, so it is possible to lend to people who have poor credit to insulate their homes so they can save money and will be able to make the payments out of the reduced energy bills they will have in the future.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the accounting for shallow retrofits and deep retrofits, and how many of the 500,000 have to get to B2.  Last year, 2020 to 2021, some 4,600 B2s were achieved and 8,640 is the target for this year.  However, that does not take into account all of the people who have come some steps closer to B2 and who will take another step to move on.  There is also the fact that the funding for this is coming from the carbon tax.  As the decade moves on, more money will be available for more retrofits and given the scale-up of the available capacity in the labour market to deliver this, the amount of funding available increases each year, so it is going to be a programme that will have more going on in the second half of the decade than the first half.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022020800002#G01600","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>My questions on programme B were all related to the programme that is going to be announced, which the Minister of State is not going to tell us anything about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022020800002#G01700","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>It is not that I am holding back the information but it has not been decided and I am not in the Cabinet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022020800002#G01800","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister of State has a good insight but we await the six o&rsquo;clock news.

I am grateful to my colleagues here for their assistance in compiling the detailed briefing for both myself and the committee.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2022, including that of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  As members will have seen from the briefing material provided to them last week, my Department is projected to spend &euro;2.074 billion on current expenditure and &euro;33 million on capital expenditure during 2022.  This represents an increase of &euro;189 million or 10% over the 2021 Revised Estimate.  In addition, my Department has a further &euro;3.2 million allocation for capital carryover.<\/p> <p>  The 2022 allocation covers financial provision for a range of key services in respect of children and young people, such as Tusla, early years and youth services.  There are also allocations in other key work streams, which include provision of accommodation for international protection seekers and refugee resettlement and other services for international protection applicants.  Legacy issues in relation to mother and baby institutions, and birth information and tracing are also funded.  In addition, there are allocations towards the areas of equality, integration and inclusion.  This includes funding towards gender equality, human rights, LGBTI+ issues, Traveller and Roma issues, migrant integration and disability policy.  <\/p> <p>  In 2021, we again faced the challenge of Covid-19.  As with 2020, the last year again saw significant impact from the pandemic on the work of my Department and its agencies.  The early learning and care sector, Tusla, youth services, equality and international protection accommodation have been particularly affected.  However, it is important that I acknowledge the tremendous efforts which continue to be made across the whole of our sector in response to the pandemic.  It has been an extremely challenging time for us all and hopefully 2022 will see us start to normalise life with our focus moving from reactive towards more developmental in nature. <\/p> <p>  To outline my Department&rsquo;s Vote in more detail, I have provided the select committee with details of the funding allocations across the different programme areas, along with a summary by subhead, including details of changes over the 2021 figures.  In terms of Vote spending, three areas of the Vote represent 89% of the Department&rsquo;s allocation, namely Tusla, accounting for 43%, early years programmes and schemes, accounting for 34%, and international protection accommodation, accounting for 12% of the overall allocation.  I will now briefly address these areas in turn.   <\/p> <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Estimate includes provision of &euro;898 million for Tusla, an increase of &euro;40.5 million or 5% over the 2021 allocation.  This funding will allow Tusla to respond to a number of challenges such as addressing increasing demand for their services and developing their mainstream residential services for children.  The budget will allow for the improvement of ICT systems and data management processes, particularly in the aftermath of the HSE cyber attack in May of last year.  It will also allow for additional posts to be funded, including 100 front-line staff and 48 residential care workers, and to meet expected demand arising from forthcoming birth information and tracing legislation.<\/p><p>It will allow Tusla to support the community and voluntary sector, which delivers services on its behalf.  It will maintain support for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services and address recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s accommodation review of refuge provision.<\/p><p> Another significant portion of my Department&rsquo;s spending is on early learning and care, which has an overall allocation of &euro;716 million - a &euro;78 million increase on the 2021 allocation.  The funding requirements for this area have been significantly impacted by Covid.  Funding in 2022 allows my Department to continue to meet the costs of the two-year early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and the associated access and inclusion model, AIM, which supports children with additional needs to access the ECCE programme.  The allocation for the national childcare scheme, NCS, will meet the costs of delivering the scheme and support the sustainability and operation of the early learning and care, ELC, and school age childcare, SAC, sector.  The funding provided in 2022 will also allow for the extension of the age of eligibility to access the NCS universal subsidy to 15 years, and this will be made available to all families. <\/p><p> Funding is also being allocated to introduce a new core funding model from the autumn.  Under the new scheme, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures.  The funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff and establish career structures.  We will introduce or improve other features of provision that contribute to quality, such as non-contact time, planning, training, and curriculum implementation.  The additional investment will also support the programme for Government commitment to support the drawing up of an employment regulation order.<\/p><p> The allocation for costs associated with the provision of accommodation for international protection seekers has seen an increase of &euro;41 million to &euro;259 million in 2022.  The allocation includes funding towards implementing the recommendations of the White Paper to end direct provision and to establish a new international protection support service.  For the first time, this allocation has a capital allocation, amounting to &euro;12.5 million, to progress this key priority.<\/p><p> International protection seekers&rsquo; accommodation is a demand-led service with requirements for accommodation and services increasing as numbers of new international protection applications increase.  In the latter half of 2021 there has been a sharp increase in the number of new arrivals seeking international protection accommodation in Ireland, with more than 2,260 new arrivals in the period from 1 November 2021 to 30 January 2022.  This funding will continue to provide accommodation to those seeking international protection and to cover the projected increase of costs.  This estimate is based on the likelihood that there will be pent-up demand for international protection accommodation in 2022, as previously closed off routes reopen.  A new procurement competition for accommodation is now under way to reduce reliance on short-term emergency accommodation and to ensure that the Department has sufficient accommodation capacity.<\/p><p> As well as providing for increased demand, I am progressing my pledge to replace the current system with one that respects the dignity of those seeking international protection.  I established a transition team in my Department last year to drive the implementation of this new model on a phased basis to 2024.  This year, the initial capital allocation of &euro;12.5 million will be used for the acquisition of accommodation with a focus on acquiring turnkey properties and properties that require upgrading or renovations.  Current funding will provide for the roll-out of an approved housing body scheme so that they can begin to bring properties on stream and develop a pipeline for accommodation.  It will also be used to roll out a rent-a-room scheme and source private tenancies to increase the availability of accommodation.  I have a commitment from within the national development plan that as capital requirements in this area increase, additional funding will be provided to progress this important priority action area.<\/p><p> With the rest of the Vote, there are of course other policy areas that will be progressed in 2022.  The 2022 Estimates contain provisions to support overall management of the Government&rsquo;s action plan for responding to the needs of former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This includes certain key actions, including at the Tuam site on foot of the proposed certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) legislation, research and commemoration initiatives.  My Department is working on information and tracing legislation to allow access to birth information for adopted persons and additional funding has been provided in the Estimates to Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to support the implementation of this legislation.<\/p><p> The 2022 Estimates will allow me to continue to provide funding in the important areas of equality, disability, inclusion and integration.  These are very significant and challenging areas and the Vote includes funding streams for areas such as the National Disability Authority, refugee and migrant integration, gender equality, LGBTI+ and Traveller and Roma initiatives.  As I mentioned earlier, these areas are in receipt of additional funding in 2022.<\/p><p> The 2022 Estimates have seen an increase of &euro;3.5 million for youth services to more than &euro;73 million.  This level of funding will support the delivery by the voluntary youth work sector of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities.  I believe that the youth sector is essential to reach and address the most marginalised and vulnerable young people.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the significant increase in resources under my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2022 allows for the continuation of vital services to some of our most disadvantaged communities while providing for a number of important opportunities for a targeted development and improvement of services.  Deputies may be assured that I will continue to work closely with all sectors and stakeholders, as we strive to maximise outcomes from the resources being considered today.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention and I will be pleased to respond to questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#B00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#C00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I am contributing from within Leinster House.  I thank the Minister for that outline of the revised Estimates.  There is much to welcome, particularly the increases as outlined by the Minister.  The capital allocation for international protection seekers is very welcome also.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions related to adequacy of funding, and whether the increases the Minister has described are sufficient to meet the greatly enhanced commitments for his Department.<\/p> <p>  The increase under the Tusla section is welcome but I am conscious that the Minister has said he will need to fund quite a significant number of additional posts arising from the expected increased demand due to the forthcoming birth information and tracing legislation.  This committee was very actively engaged in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022.  I believe I can say that it is a matter of disappointment for us as members of the committee that the recommendation we made as to the mode of communication with adopted persons where a birth parent has expressed a no-contact preference.  That recommendation was not taken up by the Minister's Department in the shape of the legislation.  That is disappointing to us.  It is relevant in the Estimates because we had recommended the communication would be by way of registered post.  I am conscious there would be a significantly increased cost with regard to staff time in the alternative method of communication by phone or by meeting, which is provided for in the Bill.  Will the Minister say whether there is sufficient funding here?  The Minister is saying 100 additional front-line staff, but will that be enough to meet the demands coming from the new legislation?<\/p> <p>  On the early years funding allocations the Minister has spoken about the new core funding model.  Clearly, huge expectation has built up among parents, providers and staff on that, and that it will be in place from the autumn so we would actually see significant reductions in childcare fees for parents.  It is a huge issue across my constituency in Dublin Bay South.  The cost of childcare is a huge issue for everyone.  The Minister has described an increase of just over 10%.  Will this be an adequate allocation to really create that radical change in the core funding model that parents, providers and staff are all expecting in the childcare and early years education sector in the autumn?  Perhaps the Minister will say more on that.<\/p> <p>  On the mother and baby homes, the Minister does not refer in his speech to the amount that will be needed for setting up the redress scheme.  Again, we are expecting to see that redress scheme for survivors in place by the autumn.  I am aware that at page 31 there is a more detailed document where the set-up costs are described as being provided for within the funding that the Minister has outlined.  I believe that the Minister's document says that the financial payments will be allocated separately, which is the actual payment of redress to survivors of mother and baby homes.  Will the Minister expand on where that is going to come from, whether it will be within this year's allocation, or will it be pushed forward into the budget for 2023?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#C00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>A significant additional investment overall in Tusla this year of more than &euro;41 million extra follows on from the largest ever increase Tusla received last year of &euro;66 million.<\/p><p>Much of that focused on the recruitment of additional staff.  As the Deputy said, there will be more than 280 new staff recruited to Tusla in 2022, with 100 of them front-line staff and 48 of them related to residential placements, with which we know there is a significant issue.<br\/><br\/>In terms of how that breaks down to resourcing the information and tracing legislation, 30 of those staff will be allocated to the implementation of the information and tracing legislation.  A genealogist is included in that group thus recognising that a wider range of skills and expertise are needed within Tusla to fully implement the range of tasks and responsibilities that it will have.  Tusla will be better empowered to undertake tracing with the statutory basis that it will be given under the information and tracing legislation.  I know from my engagement with groups who represent adopted people, they felt that the genealogist skills was one that the organisation lacked, and that is something which is recognised by myself and the chief executive.<br\/><br\/>Please note that we have provided an extra allocation to the Adoption Authority of Ireland of &euro;1.3 million to allow it to undertake its functions under the information and tracing legislation.  That will allow for the hiring of additional staff, a new head of records, a new archivist, and new administrative staff to provide support.  The money allocated to AAI and Tusla will support both organisations with the information campaign that will be rolled out, once the legislation is passed, to inform parents, adopted people and people who have questions about their birth and origin, and about their rights under the provision of the new legislation.<br\/><br\/>On the provision of core funding under the early years allocation, the allocation has been significantly increased and the central part of that is core funding.  A sum of &euro;16 million has been provided this year and that will equate in a full year, in 2023, to &euro;207 million.<br\/><br\/>In terms of adequacy, core funding supports services because we recognise that many services struggle in terms of their own sustainability.  We want to enable the payment of better wages for staff.  We want to be able to deliver on the pay scales that we believe will be provided by the Joint Labour Committee and the employment regulation order, which I hope will be agreed soon between employer and employee representatives but that requires the State stepping up with this very significant additional investment.  The <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for that, with services, is the agreement to freeze fees.  For the first time in the history of the State, we now have a mechanism to stop the increase in fees that we had seen, particularly dramatically prior to Covid.  If one considers the level of fee increases in the last two years, they have actually been quite small.  In 2021, it was only about a 1% fee increase on average.  That is primarily because of the very significant State support that was provided through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which meant that services were sustainable and did not have to increase their fees.  The EWSS will be withdrawn by the end of April.  The new core funding will kick in from September of next year.  The allocation also contains a bridging or transition fund of &euro;37 million, which will continue to support the sustainability of services in May to August of this year.<br\/><br\/>We are very clear that this is not the end of our investment in this area because, as the Deputy rightly said, we need to ensure we can cut the cost and enhance affordability for parents.  The first step towards that is a fee freeze and the next stop is increased investment in the national childcare scheme, NCS, that directs subventions parents receive.  I have been very clear, and I think that all three parties in government are very clear, that in the next budget and in following budgets we want to see significant additional investment in the NCS.  We saw the beginning of that this year in terms of the removal of the wraparound hours, which will kick in spring and benefit about 5,000 children from disadvantaged families.  We will see the next part of that in September of this year when the increase of the universal subvention from three up to 15 years kicks in, which will benefit thousands of families.  We are very clear that more money will continue to go into the NCS and because we will now have a fee freeze, parents will see the difference.  I say that because, as we saw in previous years, when the Government put more money into the NCS it was immediately eroded by fee increases that service providers implemented.<br\/><br\/>Finally, in terms of redress, the allocation for redress is not contained in these Estimates.  It will be the subject of a Revised Estimate, I imagine, for 2022 and then, I suppose, the subhead will be built in from budget 2023 onwards.  The final package on redress was not agreed at the time of the budget.  As members will know, we announced it in November of this year following the budget.  We hope to be in a position to enable people to start to draw down payments in 2022 about which I am absolutely determined.  I will work with the committee and everyone else to make sure the legislation gets through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible but at that point, it will be the subject, I imagine, of a supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#C00400","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Survivors are keen to have the redress scheme up and running as soon as possible and we will all work constructively with the Department on that.

In these revised Estimates, does the Minister believe there is enough in terms of safety to deal with the challenge that private services pose to Tusla?  Over recent years there has been a significant growth in the private services used by Tusla in residential and foster care.  These are more expensive services than we get from Tusla units and foster carers.  They are more vulnerable to price increases and shocks.  Also, private residential units are not covered by HIQA so we do not have the same level of oversight.  There is general inflation and I am concerned that it will be used as an opportunity to increase prices.  That means one will be left with young people in a private care that, realistically, Tusla can no longer afford.  However, it would be devastating to that young person's care plan and placement to move him or her out.<\/p> <p>  I wish to discuss the private foster care issue.  Private foster care placements cost between three and three and a half times as much as a Tusla placement.  That drains the budget for Tusla and makes its recruitment and service development harder to achieve within budget.  Ultimately, that creates a situation where there is going to be greater demand for the private placements to fill even bigger gaps in Tusla and so on.  In addition, this becomes self-fulfilling and self-replicating.  Can the Minister tell us what he is doing to limit the amount that Tusla spends on private services that are a structural weakness within Tusla's current arrangements?<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme of Government to provide inhouse therapeutic services within Tusla.  Is there sufficient room in these Estimates to develop the services in the coming months?<\/p> <p>  The failings of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, have become very public.  They are well known and have been well discussed but they are certainly becoming very public.  I think that inhouse therapeutic services are an essential element to provide very deeply traumatised and hurt young people in care with the appropriate services that they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#D00400","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Issues concerning CAMHS do not fall within the scope of these Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#D00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, but I am interested in the development of in-house therapeutic services within Tusla as an alternative to CAMHS.

I think there is a role for them, but it should be to deal with sudden spikes in demand rather than being a central element of provision.  Over the years, the private sector has had to become too great an element of the central provision of Tusla services.  I think that is something Tusla recognises.  One of the things I have been able to do this year, with the extra &euro;41 million that is being invested in Tusla, is ensure that &euro;3 million of that goes to Tusla residential care for the enhancement of mainstream residential care provision.  As I noted, that will include the hiring of 48 additional staff for mainstream residential care.  That is an important enhanced investment in Tusla's own capacity to provide residential care placements.<\/p> <p>  As we know, Tusla also significantly relies on the community and voluntary sector for residential care placements.  Some of the additional &euro;6 million that is being provided under these Estimates to the community and voluntary sector, for which Tusla provides finance, will also no doubt support enhanced provision of residential care in the community and voluntary sector.  We identified this as an issue and it is one we are seeking to address.  However, it will not be solved in one budget. as I am sure the Deputy will understand.  The enhancement of Tusla's own ability to provide residential care placements is very important.  We are definitively investing in that in this year's budget.<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop in-house therapeutic services.  I visited the Dublin north central therapeutic hub before Christmas.  I met with the team there, both in its headquarters and its community building on Manor Street.  I saw the benefit of such intensive supports for young people who have come to Tusla's attention.  I am pleased we have been able to dedicate part of the &euro;41 million to supporting that service.  Some &euro;700,000 is being provided under Tusla's business plan this year for the enhancement of therapeutic services for children in care.  The pay element of that will cover the cost of hiring eight whole-time equivalent staff specifically in that area.<\/p> <p>  There are also a number of other mandates for Tusla under its business plan this year.  The mapping of all existing Tusla and Tusla-commissioned therapeutic services has been revised into a great framework for therapeutic services for children.  There is a requirement for a multidisciplinary assessment and care plan for children who require therapeutic services as well.  To be able to provide a similar hub in all Tusla regions will require sustained investment but we are making a start on that.  It is an enhancement of Tusla services, to which I am committed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#E00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials who are joining us today to discuss the Revised Estimates.  I will start with the cost of childcare.  I think everyone recognises that parents pay far too much for the service they get.  I commend the Minister and his officials on their efforts to reduce costs substantially in a way that will be impactful for all parents.  When he was before this committee previously, the Minister mentioned that an expert group was reviewing the funding model and specifically looking at targeted areas in which additional funding could be put to use for those who are at a disadvantage compared with others who can afford the cost of childcare.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on the options the expert group is working on and proposing to address the issue and alleviate some of the burden on parents.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the provision of an additional &euro;40.5 million for Tusla.  Will a proportion of that be allocated to the family resource programme or any capital projects?  I note that in 2021 there was an underspend of &euro;3.5 million in the Department's capital allocation.  I would like to understand how that happened.  Was it due to delays to some projects?<\/p> <p>  The third issue I raise relates to the international protection accommodation services support.  I welcome the establishment of the service and the capital support in the region of &euro;12.5 million that was announced.  For what specifically will this fund be used?  What types of accommodation is the Department looking at in terms of build or modular examples?  I would like to get an understanding of that on the basis that we are in a housing crisis and there are constraints, including skills shortages.<\/p> <p>  I know the mental health youth task force, the Pathfinder project, is a cross-departmental project led by the Department of Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  There has been a lack of action on the project since its establishment in 2016.  As a member of the Cabinet, I ask the Minister to ensure some focus is placed on this issue in 2022 and that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth forms part of the overall cross-departmental approach in order to implement long-lasting change around youth mental health.  I know the Minister is passionate about this issue and we all want to make an important contribution in this area.  I ask for support for it, including through the Minister's Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#E00600","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>On the cost of childcare, the Deputy is absolutely right that childcare is too expensive in this country.  Parents pay too much and staff in childcare are not paid enough.  That is something we are seeking to resolve.  We are taking a step-by-step approach to the issue.  We made the call that this year we would focus on supporting services to better pay their staff because we are seeing a huge turnover in staff at the moment.  Young people - let us be honest, it is young women - who study for three or four years to get a level 7 or level 8 qualification start in childcare and find they are being paid less than they were in the temporary or part-time jobs they were doing to support themselves at university.  That is not sustainable and it is the reason we are looking at the issue.  We have established a joint labour committee for the sector and we are seeking an employment regulation order to set a payscale for the different levels, such as entry level, room leader level and manager level, and to have those implemented.<\/p> <p>  Many service providers are just breaking even and some are not even breaking even.  They need additional support.  That is why we have provided the core funding.  That was one of the recommendations of the expert group.  We engaged with the group while it was doing its work and actually brought in core funding before the group reported because we knew it would be central to the report.  Rather than waiting for budget 2023, which would have meant waiting for another year, we brought in core funding this year before the expert group reported.<\/p> <p>  Core funding is about providing sustainability to the services and better pay for staff.  In exchange for that, providers must provide a fee freeze so that we do not see continued increases in fees for parents.  That is only step one.  Step two is the extra investment in the NCS.  That was also advised by the expert group, which made a number of suggestions on what we can do with the NCS.  One of these was to get rid of the wraparound hours.  We are doing that in this year's budget.  A second recommendation was to extend the universality of the NCS from the age of three up to the age of 15.  Again, we did that in this year's budget.  Another recommendation was the introduction of an additional premium for families with multiple children in childcare.  We will look at that for next year's budget.<\/p><p>The other step is to broaden the universal subvention, which is 50 cent per year at the moment, and look at what will happen if it is increased.  There are a range of options.  As I have stated, the work we have to do to make childcare more affordable is not just in the budget this year; it is a continued piece of work.  What I have heard clearly from all three party leaders is that there is full commitment across the Government to this investment.  We have to make childcare more affordable for parents.<\/p><p> Another key element of the recommendations of the expert group was the idea of a DEIS model for childcare.  That would provide the ability to put in enhanced supports for children from disadvantaged communities.  That can take several forms, such as the access and inclusion model, AIM, approach, which supports children with disabilities.  That comes in seven different levels.  Some of them are universal, while others are more targeted to a particular service.  We might design something like that in the context of our DEIS approach.  Again, I hope to begin work in the budget next year.  It will take several years before it is fully rolled out but it is a really positive step, recognising that the education of children does not begin in junior infants any more; it begins in the ECCE programme and we have to support that.  Certainly, I am aware in my role as Minister with responsibility for equality that, for example, 10% fewer Traveller children undertake the free two-year pre-school ECCE programme compared with children from the settled community.  Education disadvantage is being built in there from day one.  That is something we have to combat and I am considering it in the context of the Traveller and Roma education strategy.<\/p><p> In the context of family resource centres, the capital budget this year for Tusla is not huge.  It is mainly focused on the maintenance and upgrading of its existing centres.  Tusla is currently doing a big piece of work looking at family supports that it provides throughout the country.  I know calls for family resource centres have come from the constituency of the Deputy and other constituencies throughout the country.  One of the issues we are considering is what additional family support services, rather than centres, can be provided and whether that can address some of the needs in some of these communities.  That work is being done at the moment between Tusla and my Department.  When it is complete, we can take a step back and look at where or if we are putting in additional family resource centres or perhaps just providing additional services in a particular community.<\/p><p> Finally, in terms of the international protection support service, IPSS, we are creating to help end direct provision, the capital spend is &euro;12.5 million.  This year, that will primarily be used for purchasing existing units.  We are looking at several larger units, that is, seven, eight, nine or ten bedroom units, that will be used for the accommodation of single persons, but we will also be purchasing several two or three bedroom units.  As regards where we are, part of the significant current investment that is provided for the IPSS under this budget will be used to create new funding streams for approved housing bodies, AHBs, for which they can bid, as they can at the moment, and use to start to construct units.  We are taking a multipronged approach to this.  We are doing some purchase right now, but we are also providing money for AHBs to build units themselves for community-based accommodation, that is, phase 2 accommodation.  It is to be hoped that later this year we can start to move towards the planning of phase 1 accommodation, which is the reception and integration centres.  It is important to note there is a strong commitment in the national development plan to increasing and providing additional capital funding as we need it in order to end direct provision by the end of 2024.<\/p><p> The pathfinder project is primarily led through the Department of Health.  I am happy to engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on whether there is anything my Department can do to assist in that, but it is primarily led through health.  I am acutely aware of the importance of supporting all measures to enhance the mental health of young people.  Obviously, the youth services that are funded by my Department - we have a significant &euro;5 million increase in investment this year - are very important to supporting universal service but, in particular, targeted services, such as UBU Your Place Your Space, in areas of high disadvantage.  We will get eight new services opened this year, which is really positive, but we are looking at ways of better linking in youth services with wider mental health services.  In particular the early intervention part is so important before reaching a situation where CAMHS or other higher degree interventions are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#E00700","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I am keeping one eye on the television screen because I am due in the D&aacute;il Chamber any minute now.

As the Minister is aware, it has been well-documented, sadly, that there has been an increase in demand for domestic violence services.

The ability for the decision support service to be up and running in June is partly reliant on the committee and its good work in terms of getting pre-legislative scrutiny done quickly.  I appreciate its support in that regard.  I am absolutely committed to getting it up and running for June.  The Deputy cited the 2021 figure for 2022.  We have significantly increased that.  We actually have &euro;7.3 million in the DSS, an increase of &euro;1.5 million.  That is a recognition that once June comes, the service will be extremely busy.  It will be providing a range of skills and advice to people who require assistance with the important life decisions they have to make.  It is central to our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to have the DSS established.  It is also very important in terms of getting rid of the whole idea of wardship, which is the incredibly outdated system that operates now and is being challenged in the courts at the moment.  Significant additional budget has been provided, staff are in place and it is working as kind of a subset of the Mental Health Commission but in terms of having the legislative power to start to be in a position to provide people with this advice, I am really hoping to get that done by June.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are committed to getting it through the Houses as quickly as possible once pre-legislative scrutiny is completed.<\/p> <p>  As regards the additional staff for domestic, sexual and gender-base violence, DSGBV, as the Deputy is aware, this area is in significant flux because it will move out of my Department and Tusla into the Department of Justice.  That follows on from the audit that was done and it is a request made by a significant number of NGOs working in the sector.  We have listened to them and are making that change on foot of those requests.  As the Deputy is aware, an extra &euro;3 million has been provided by my Department for Tusla for DSGBV this year.<\/p><p>That will bring it from &euro;28 million in budget 2021 to &euro;31 million in budget 2022.  That was on foot of an increase of &euro;2.7 million last year.  There has been sustained investment in current spending in domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence services since I became Minister.<br\/><br\/>On the question of staff, Tusla has made the decision to hire a number of specialists in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for its child protection units in each region in the country.  That is because Tusla recognises that where there is a case of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence, I suppose, the immediate risk of abuse is to the mother.  There must be recognition that such action could have major long-term consequences for the children in that relationship as well.  That additional investment will not move out of Tusla when the change happens.  Even when responsibility for the provision of the refuges and the like move to the new entity under the Department of Justice, Tusla will still have a strong domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence specialism within it, recognising that Tusla will continue to engage, unfortunately, with hundreds or perhaps thousands of families with experience of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence.  It will continue to need expertise in that area, even if it is not in charge of the provision of refuges and rape crisis centres etc.  It is a move with some foresight by Tusla and one I really welcome.<br\/><br\/>There is the question of whether the additional 48 front-line staff in residential care will end the practice mentioned by the Deputy.  I am not going to be bold enough to say that will end the practice, although I hope it can see it reduced.  We need to reduce that practice and ensure that where a child needs residential care, it is provided in a proper and long-term residential care placement.  The Deputy knows that cases are sometimes so urgent that these <i>ad hoc<\/i>solutions or locations for placement are used but it is not the practice we would like to see continue.  It is important that in those cases we at least have the staff to support the young person wherever they are placed.  We absolutely want to see permanent residential care run by either Tusla or the community and voluntary sector.  I remind the Deputy of what I said to Deputy Costello earlier, which is that there is an extra &euro;3 million for Tusla to enhance its residential care placement capacity this year.  That is a positive step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#F00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the rest of the delegation for joining us today.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister in securing additional funding and his Department has a really broad remit that provides essential services, all of which need more resources.<\/p> <p>  I have several points to raise.  Under the subhead relating to mother and baby institutions, the increase in allocations for this area are especially welcome.  However, the briefing document only mentions Tuam as a site to be examined under the burials Bill, implying that only Tuam is budgeted for when there are, of course, many other known locations of potential mass graves.  Will the Minister comment on that or does the budget allow for more sites to be examined?  There is also reference to an enhanced model of stakeholder engagement.  Given the reported unsatisfactory nature of engagement so far, will the Minister outline what the new model will look like and who is conducting the research and commemoration initiatives referred to?<\/p> <p>  Many other Deputies have raised the question of early learning and care, and there is again a welcome increase in funding for the area.  The committee has discussed child poverty and there has been criticism of the national childcare scheme because it does not account for additional needs faced by disadvantaged families.  One of the surprising points to learn was that the single biggest contributing factor to children being in poverty is being part of a lone-parent family.  Will there be targeted supports in that regard or will there be an opportunity to address the matter?  There are cases where children are not guaranteed access to proper meals and there is a pressing need for targeted programmes in that area.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement asserts that funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff in an established career structure.  Will the Minister elaborate on how that would happen in practice?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referenced the funding towards implementing the White Paper to end direct provision.  It is almost a year since the White Paper was published.  What has been the progress in moving forward on ending direct provision since and how will the allocation of &euro;12.5 million help achieve this?<\/p> <p>  We all expected to see more reference to dealing with gender-based violence in the statement and the documents.  It is mentioned under Tusla's budget but given the necessary focus on the area since Christmas, and with the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" documentary this week, I would have hoped for stronger prioritisation.  In response to a parliamentary question last year, the Minister informed me the cost of maintaining a single refuge space is in the region of &euro;100,000 annually.  Of course we know that to meet the targets under the Istanbul Convention we would need a huge amount of funding to make a provision for that.  Where is the allocation to increase the number of refuge spaces that are very desperately needed, especially in large areas of the country with absolutely no spaces whatever?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#G00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>With regard to the allocation for actions under the institutional burials Bill, that legislation is clear in setting up a format of how to identify an area that will be subject to an agency created under the Bill to undertake the recovery and identification of remains.  It is accepted by everybody that Tuam will be the first site where such an agency will investigate and the budget exists to start the work on the Tuam site.  The Bill is also clear that should other sites meet the requirements of the legislation, an agency could be established for those sites as well.  Our Department's primary focus is on advancing the work towards Tuam and the funding to start the work on the agency.  It is quite a significant amount of funding of approximately &euro;4 million that is in the budget to start the agency once we get that legislation passed.  I hope to publish the new draft of the legislation by the end of this month and introduce it to the Oireachtas shortly afterwards.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the enhanced model of stakeholder engagement, work is ongoing for a long-term mechanism where the views of the survivor community can be conveyed to the Government.  As we know there are a very significant number of groups in the sector, some representing specific issues and others specific areas of the areas of the country.  Some may represent survivors of particular institutions.  In order for a clear line of communication to be established with a clear understanding of the diverse range of needs that survivors have, we are looking at a range of measures.<\/p> <p>  The previous Minister had established a collaborative forum that brought together approximately 18 former survivors or family members of former residents of these institutions.  We have put forward some proposals to that group on the idea of a survivor advocate or perhaps even considering an advocate model, which would engage with the Government in ascertaining the views of survivors.  We hope later this year to bring a final proposal to the Government on this enhanced model of stakeholder engagement.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of initiatives in this area.  There is a commemoration initiative grant whereby groups around the country may apply for a grant for a commemoration initiative they want to undertake with respect to a mother and baby or county institution in an area.  My Department does an annual call for those and it can support a range of initiatives.  We try very much to be guided by what survivors are looking for and what they think is appropriate with regard to the institution under which they have grouped.  There is also a cross-department group between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage looking at some of the considerations around commemoration, particularly the protection of sites of former institutions.<\/p><p>Work is ongoing between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  <\/p><p> On early learning and care and school-age childcare, the Deputy raised the issue of child poverty.  The national childcare scheme, NCS, is a really good scheme.  It is a massively enhanced ability of the State to provide financial support.  However, as it is operated, and it is only really operating since 2019, issues have arisen.  I have engaged with the Chair on this in the Chamber.  Most importantly, I have met with many community childcare providers from various parts of the country and listened to the difficulties they are having with certain elements of the NCS.  In this year's budget we have removed that provision whereby hours spent in school or in the ECCE programme were deducted from a child's free allocation.  The 20-hour allocation for children whose parents were not in education or employment meant they had their school time or ECCE time deducted from their 20 hours a week. Particularly in term time for children attending school-age child care, that was seeing the removal of their entire free allocation.  From this spring, that practice will cease, which will be of great advantage.  We estimate about 5,000 will be able to benefit from their full 20-hour allocation of free early learning and care or school-age childcare.  That is a really important immediate step in terms of addressing issues to do with poverty.<\/p><p> There is a wider measure we can take.  I referred to it when I was talking to Deputy Dillon in terms of this idea of a DEIS approach to early learning and care and school-age childcare.  It is recommended within the expert group.  We are starting work on the design of it now.  I would hope in this year's budget to be able to take some initial steps towards provision there.  On the provision of hot school meals, the Deputy is right that they are absolutely essential.  It does not fall directly within my Department.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, has increased the number of schools where that is provided.  I am aware of the work the Minister, Deputy Foley, is doing in terms of the very significant increase in the number of DEIS schools for which she has got the investment this year.  That is going to help.<\/p><p> In terms of quality, the workforce development plan sets out how we make childcare an attractive career option for individuals.  That was launched in December at the same time as the expert group.  We will be working to implement that.  The key thing is that if we are not paying childcare professionals enough they are not going to join or they are going to leave the sector.  That is why we have done core funding and why it is so important.<\/p><p> On the White Paper, the implementation of the vulnerability assessment was really important and something Ireland had been failing to do for years.  Some 650 have been undertaken this year and another 900 are in place at the moment.  On the establishment of the programme board and the expert advisory group, I met last week with Catherine Day, Lorcan Sirr and David Donoghue.  The group will be overseeing my Department, holding our feet to the fire to make sure we are implementing the White Paper.  In March of this year I hope to provide a detailed one-year update on the successes we have had in the implementation of the White Paper.  We will be able to give some detail on accommodation that we have provided.  In 2022 we plan that the first people will start to move out of direct provision centres and into accommodation in the community.  It will not be a huge number.  It will probably be just in the early 100s this year, but it is that first really important step.  To have people living independently in the community is absolutely central to the White Paper model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#G00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Some of my questions have been answered.  On the implementation of the action plan in response to the recommendations from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, I want to ask about fast-tracking the medical cards.  I have been speaking to survivors.  Good quality healthcare is so important here.  Maybe the Minister could come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  We spoke a lot today about Tusla and funding.  Is there going to be any help through Tusla for women and children trying to flee domestic violence?  The Minister is launching the public consultation on the Government strategy to combat gender-based violence next week and is committed to providing refuges in the nine counties that do not have one.  Carlow is one of them.  I have spoken to the Minister about it and have had several meetings with the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  When we speak about refuges and wrap-around services, there are significant issues when we come to safe accommodation across the country, including in Carlow and my own area.  We need to have proper supports in place working through the local authorities, like education and counselling services.  As provision of women's refuges falls under so many different Departments, it is becoming a big issue and so are the services.  I am aware that it is under the remit of the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I refer to all the other services involved, such as children's services and local authorities for a mother who needs to be housed.  If we do not get all the services right we are going to fall down.  Do we need to set up a group or what do we need to do to make sure that all the different Departments are involved?  It is not just one are; it is a lot of areas.  <\/p> <p>  I have spoken to the Minister several times about the cost of childcare.  I welcome that he is fully understanding of it and knows how much it is costing people.  He is addressing the issue of pay for childcare professionals with the funding.  These are issues that we really need to look at.<\/p> <p>  Child poverty has been mentioned.  In my own area of Carlow, families and schools have contacted me where children have left school because the mothers had to send them to a school with DEIS status to get the hot meals programme.  We have schools that do not quality for DEIS or are trying to get DEIS status.  That is another area.  We have seen so many cases recently.  The cost of living is another area that has really been affected here.  Parents have so many bills to pay with the cost of living, whether it is ESB, trying to put petrol in their car, trying to feed children or trying to pay the mortgage.  There are huge issues and they are all starting to come together.  We need to make sure that we address all areas.  <\/p> <p>  I want to ask about education.  It has come to my attention that the education and training board, ETB, and the back to education initiative, BTEI, are not accepting new learners from the Carlow early years training scheme for childcare modules.  This means any new participant who is starting on the childcare scheme will not be able to start their level 5 or level 6 childcare module until after September 2022.  They used to be able to do it in stages but this is not the case now.  The new curriculum participants are not being given the opportunity-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#H00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Deputy, that point on education is not relevant to the Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022020800002#H00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I think it is important to bring this up today.

On the medical card, the key issue with the enhanced medical card we will provide to 19,000 former residents is that it requires a legislative basis.  That has been the case in terms of survivors of the Magdalen institutions and survivors of the industrial schools as well.  We need a legislative basis for the provision of a large volume of medical cards.  That is why we are looking to move the legislation underpinning the institutions payment scheme as quickly as possible.  My official are working on the heads right now and we hope to have them to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, apologies to Deputy Cairns that I did not get to answer her question on that.  I might cover some of that as well.  I will be speaking about in the D&aacute;il later this evening also.  The consultation phase of the third national strategy on DSGBV will be launched soon.  That is being led by the Department of Justice.  Government has taken a strategic approach in that the issue and the Government's response to DSGBV will now be led by the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>The Deputy summarised the reason for that very well when she spoke about many Departments, agencies, local authorities and health services all doing little bits, which reflects fragmentation.  We recognised that in the programme for Government.  That is why we set up an audit to identify where everything is being done right now and how we can bring it together.  The Government has now taken that decision.  We will bring it together under the Department of Justice under a new entity that will be operated by that Department.  That will mean responsibility for the provision of refuge and those services to which the Deputy referred will not be overseen by my Department or by Tusla.  Responsibility for that will be transferred to the Department of Justice.  That is a strategic decision the Government has taken, recognising the major challenge we have with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in this country.  Centralising everything under that Department will allow for the delivery of the refuge spaces we need.  Everybody recognises we do not have enough refuges or refuge spaces.  There are significant parts of the country where counties like the Deputy's do not have such coverage and where in physical areas in larger counties it would take a hour and a half to drive to a refuge, which is an immediate disincentive to someone who might feel in real and desperate need.  There is a commitment under the capital allocation scheme, CAS, from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to finance refuge spaces but there is also a recognition that the CAS process is lengthy.  That is one of the problems we identified, namely, that it takes such a long time to build a new refuge, as well as there being a lack of spaces.  In our response to the accommodation review, which we hope to publish next week, again led by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, through the third national strategy, we will outline how we will address those particular issues.<\/p><p> The Deputy might drop me a note on the details of the child care education issue she highlighted in Carlow, which I will be happy to follow up with my officials.  <\/p><p> On child poverty, a key measure being taken is that we are investing in the EU child guarantee, an EU mandated approach to supporting free access to childcare, education and health for children in need.  The Government will be submitting its action plan to respond to the EU child guarantee by the end of March.  Our response to the EU child guarantee will be located within our wider successor strategy to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, our all-of-government approach to children and young people.  That strategy ended in 2020.  We are designing the successor strategy now, addressing child poverty.  Making sure again that we have a co-ordinated all-of-government approach to addressing child poverty will be central to the BOBF successor strategy.  I will be working with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, in the Department of Rural and Community Development on the designation of a new child poverty reduction target that the country needs to adopt.

Since 2016, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, has made it a strategic priority to promote the rights and welfare of children in direct provision and those in the Traveller and Roma communities, and we believe they are only some of the children who are impacted by the past pupil criteria.  As members of the committee will be aware, the OCO has previously expressed concerns about the impact the past pupil criteria can have on children whose mother or father did not attend secondary school or who did not attend a particular secondary school.  We, therefore, welcome the provision contained in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020 which, if enacted, would remove the ability of schools to allocate 25% of places for the children, or grandchildren, of past pupils if they are oversubscribed.<br\/><br\/>It is important to recognise that the 25% allowance can possibly affect the ability of any child whose mother, father or grandparent did not attend a particular school to get a place in that school.  However, there are groups of children who can be particularly disadvantaged.  These include Traveller children whose mother or father may not have attended any second level education; children of immigrant parents who would not have attended secondary school in Ireland; children of parents with disabilities who may not have attended a mainstream secondary school; and children of families who have had to move to a different area to find accommodation due to a number of valid reasons, including the housing crisis, returning from abroad, promotion prospects and change in family circumstances.  They are all currently at a disadvantage because of the current wording.<br\/><br\/>Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, in 1992 and has an obligation under international law to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of all children living in Ireland.  Under the convention, a child has a right to an education and secondary education should be available and accessible to every child.  Article 2 of the UNCRC, which protects children from discrimination, is one of four general principles considered integral to the rights granted to children under the convention.  Article 2 protects children from discrimination in their own right and also protects them from discrimination they may suffer as a result of their connection to their parents.<br\/><br\/>While the UNCRC itself does not define discrimination, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, has found that while treating people differently does not always amount to discrimination, a difference in treatment will be discriminatory if it &ldquo;has no objective and reasonable justification&rdquo;, that is, if it does not pursue a &ldquo;legitimate aim&rdquo;.  From a children&rsquo;s rights perspective, children have a right to be protected from discrimination and harm and should only experience differential treatment if there is a reasonable or objective basis for this and if it is consistent with children&rsquo;s rights and their best interests.  The priority given to children or grandchildren of past pupils of schools cannot be seen to be a reasonable or objective basis for treating children differently.<br\/><br\/>We believe that schools should be fully inclusive and promote equality.  Education can be a way out of disadvantage for many students yet this provision seems to say that children who had parents and grandparents who went to a particular school can get priority in obtaining a school place.  This is undoubtedly leading to a continuing cycle of disadvantage for some children.<br\/><br\/>Goal 2 of the Department of Education&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 is to ensure equity of opportunity in education and that all students are supported to fulfil their potential.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t[E]quity of opportunity and inclusivity must be fundamental principles in our education system.  Our aim is to develop a system that welcomes and meaningfully engages all students, including those with special educational needs and students at risk of educational disadvantage. <\/blockquote> <p>By allowing preferential access to schools for one group of children over others, the State is failing in its own strategic aim to provide an education system which promotes equity of opportunity and inclusivity.<br\/><br\/>From a children&rsquo;s rights perspective, children have a right to be protected from discrimination.  Putting children without an intergenerational connection with a school at a disadvantage to those with such a link is discrimination by treating children differently when they are trying to access their education.<br\/><br\/>I am grateful for the invitation to meet today and I am happy to take any questions that the members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022020800002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644278400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The National Parents Council Primary, NPC, welcomes the opportunity to submit its views to the joint committee.  At the core of all the work of the NPC primary and especially its advocacy and representation role is its vision statement, which states that the NPC wants to see an Ireland where every child has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  This vision statement speaks to equality and equity and lies at the heart of the discussion regarding the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2020.  Although it could be argued the current provision that allows schools to include admission criteria regarding family members having previously attended the school is implemented rarely, we must look to our legislation to set the tone for what we value in society.  It could also be argued that the legislation sets the tone to the effect that your history can define your future.<\/p> <p>  In recent years we have seen a dramatic change in communities, increased new housing developments, diversity in our populations and an increase in population mobility, all of which mean that our children are growing up in vastly different local communities from those in which their parents and grandparents grew up.

At the core of these communities are our schools and what happens within a school shapes the communities around them.  Who gets and does not access to a school something to the community around it.

These interviews were conducted prior to the commencement of Education (Admissions to School) Act 2018, but a common theme running through the research was that the Act, although undoubtedly a significant step in the right direction, did not go far enough in ensuring accessibility without discrimination to Irish schools.  As one participant put it, the law is &quot;inherently discriminatory and the law should be changed&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The discriminatory impact of section 62(10)(b) of the 2018 Act can be demonstrated by applying the provision to the facts of the well documented case of Stokes <i>v<\/i>. Christian Brothers High School Clonmel.  John Stokes, a child from the Traveller community, had applied for a place in the school, which was oversubscribed - the school had received 174 applications for 140 places - due to its strong academic reputation.  John Stokes met two out of the three criteria set out in the admissions policy in the event of oversubscription, but he did not meet the third because he did not have a family connection with the school.  His father, like most Traveller men of his generation, had not attended secondary school and he was the eldest child in the family.  Of those who satisfied the three criteria, 57 applicants were allocated a place on the sibling ground and 36 boys secured a place by virtue of the parental rule.  This meant there were 47 places left for the remaining 84 applicants.  A lottery was subsequently held and John Stokes, like 37 other boys, failed to secure a place.  Crucially, if the so-called parental rule had not been included in the admissions policy, there would have been 83 places available for 120 students.  In other words, John Stokes's odds of success in the lottery would have increased from 56% to 69%.  Importantly, for the purposes of our discussion here today, the subsequent decision to limit the number of places that could be reserved for the children of former pupils to 25% in the 2018 legislation would have made absolutely no difference whatsoever to John Stokes.  After all, 36 out of 140 places equates to 25.7%.<br\/><br\/>My view is that any admissions criteria in oversubscribed schools will result in discommoding certain students and families but it should not automatically discommode Traveller or Roma children, the children of minority ethnic groups, the children of same-sex or single parents, whose fathers might not necessarily be identifiable, or of those who are forced to move county or country for employment reasons.  I am very happy to discuss any of the issues raised in our research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022020800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. David Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644278400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting Barnardos here today to provide evidence on this important issue.  In 2020 Barnardos supported almost 18,000 children and their families.  We deliver evidence-informed outcome-focused services for children and their parents and careers in family homes, in schools and in our 45 centres throughout Ireland.  Our services are trauma-informed focusing on the impact of adverse childhood experiences on the lives of children and parents with whom we work.  We work with families to help them address issues affecting their children&rsquo;s development and well-being.  The children to whom we offer support are often living in complex and frequently chaotic circumstances, affected by traumatic life situations such as poverty, abuse, parental poor mental health, neglect, separation and parental addiction.  Education is often a primary route out of disadvantage for many of these children.<\/p> <p>  We support amending the existing legislation, section 62 of the Education Act 2018, which allows schools to adopt admission policies that reserve 25% of places for children of parents or grandparents who went to that particular school.  It goes against the spirit of Article 28 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognises children&rsquo;s right to education and provides that states must achieve this right on the basis of equal opportunity.  Section 62 also allows schools to introduce admission policies which could unjustifiably disadvantage many of the children we support.  For example, many of the children we support have parents and grandparents who struggled to engage with the education system themselves when they were children.  Some of the children with whom we work have parents who were not educated in this country.  It is inappropriate and unjust that these children should have less of a chance of attending a school that adopts section 62(10)(b).<\/p> <p>  The existing legislation sends out the wrong message to children, parents, grandparents and society as a whole.  It tells children that where their parents and grandparents did or did not go to school determines their future opportunities.  We know at a population level parental educational attainment affects children&rsquo;s future outcomes.  We should be adopting measures to address, not reinforce, this fact further.  Section 62 reminds parents and grandparents that their educational history may influence or restrict their children's and grandchildren&rsquo;s opportunities.  Limiting a child&rsquo;s educational options due to having parents or grandparents who they themselves had limited options is the epitome of promoting intergenerational disadvantage and discrimination.  A child&rsquo;s educational options should never be negatively affected by the education of their parents and grandparents.<\/p> <p>  Barnardos believes in children&rsquo;s rights and promoting policies that protect and enforce these rights.  All educational policies should seek to promote equality of opportunity and combat disadvantage, particularly given the lifelong impact educational attainment can have on the life of a child.  Maintaining section 62(10)(b) would be the wrong decision for children, regardless of how widespread its adoption is across schools.Giving consideration to the voice of children, we believe no child would want their opportunities limited by the where their parents and grandparents went to school.<\/p> <p>  The current section should be repealed in order to ensure equal opportunity for all children and avoid the discrimination of certain groups of children, potentially those who are experiencing vulnerabilities or facing disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022020800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The first questioner is Deputy Conway-Walsh.

Every year, we are inundated with distraught parents who have not got a place for their child for various reasons.  We see the most support from our cohort of parents for a place in a school to be given preference, if one has a sibling in that school.  Sometimes there may be six or seven years between siblings and one has had the experience of a school and it is important that one's next child has access to that school as well.  For the same reasons that have been spoken about before, we do not hold that because you has had a parent or grandparent in a school, preferential treatment should be given.  The movement of people for employment purposes or in other circumstances, for example, or even in the context of those returning to the country, it happens time and again that families cannot get children into schools.<\/p> <p>  One of the main things that crops up every year is that you will be offered a place in November, you do not get the school you was looking for, you may end up getting nowhere and you may find out the following June, July or August that you got a place.  From speaking to schools, it is all down to the fact that parents will enrol their children in as many schools as they can.  Parents will pay the fee to keep their children on the books and then decide at the end of the year to which school they want to send them.<\/p> <p>  All of those places are locked up within schools.  In terms of giving everybody an equal shot at places that are out there, we will hit peak numbers in 2023 to 2024.  They will start to decline slightly after that.  In terms of giving everybody absolutely equal access, we have to look at how school places are allocated and what happens when schools are oversubscribed.  That may be because a parent has accepted three or four different schools.<\/p> <p>  We should focus on a system whereby if you accept a school place, you are taken off the other lists.  That offers a free space at a time in the year where it does not become a crisis point and this is all dealt with in the same month or two, such as between the middle of October and the middle of November.

While we might need to do much work around admissions and that issue of multiple applying, and why that even happens, the important point is that we need to make sure that what we allow in admissions policy is equal and fair.  Before we even get into who is going to what school and what lists they are on, we have a criteria for people being able to apply for admissions to a school.  I refer to the idea that we would have something within that admission policy that sets a tone for our society that allows for some children to have an unfair advantage in terms of getting into some schools over other children who will never reach those criteria.  The tone that we set, as a society, and the communication to children and families within communities that they are not allowed into this level of school is a dangerous one for us to continue to set.

Many groups of children are two steps back because of it, and will be two steps back for the next two generations.  Again, it continues.  It is very clearly set out.

It is heartwarming to hear the support for the Bill, which I drafted.  What has been interesting this and last week is that this has opened up a wider discussion on the nature of Irish education and who it serves.  It is beginning to become clear that, effectively, it serves the patron.  What happens every year is that parents and children are at the heart of this scramble for what is perceived to be the better or best school in their area.  It is depressing that we have come to assume there has to be such a suggestion that one school is better than another and that not every school could be of a similar standard and have similar outcomes and resources.<\/p> <p>  I believe fundamentally that we need a Finnish revolution in Irish education.  We have 4,000 schools in a country that has the same population as Manchester.  We have schools competing against each other.  When there is that level of competition it leads to inequality.  This debate comes down to a scenario where some children are struggling to get into a school, and that should not be a reality.  I think all members of this committee, regardless of our background, agree that we do not want a scenario in which children are turned away from a school, for whatever reason.  If the State was front and centre in the provision of school places, there would be a school in each individual school district that could accommodate every child in the area, not the current multiplicity of schools that separate children on the basis of religion, gender and sometimes income.<\/p> <p>  With that in mind, what we have been doing in the past two weeks, unbeknownst to ourselves almost, is having a wider conversation about school provision, the patronage model and the lack of involvement by the Department of Education.  Within all that, I believe a certain sector that wants us to keep the generational bloodline of succession within its schools exercised a disproportionate influence over the Education (Admission to Schools) Act.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said last week, the relevant section in the Act is completely contradictory because another section in the same Act states there should not be familial advantage for any particular family.  Despite that, this provision, which does not read with the rest of the Bill, was wedged in at the behest of a certain strong lobby group.<\/p> <p>  I agree with everything the witnesses have said.  I do not have too many questions.  The only defence for this provision last week was along the lines, \"Ah sure, it is never really used.\"  That is a pathetic excuse because even if one child in this Republic was on the rough end of this provision because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not attend the school, that knowledge would probably sit with that child for life.  It would make that child feel for life that they were just was not the same because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not have the same opportunities.  <\/p> <p>  It is funny because - my mother would probably kill me for saying this in public session but I will say it anyway - I am reluctant to ask in my own family whether all of my grandparents went to secondary school because I am pretty sure not all of them did.  I am still reluctant to ask that question because there is a level of shame attached to that.  Last week, Senator Eileen Flynn, who cannot be here today, gave very powerful testimony about how nobody in her family had been to secondary school - neither her father or grandfather - and how emotional she felt that this could potentially be a disadvantage to her.<\/p> <p>  Education is so personal and emotive.  It says everything, too much, about us.  For those trying to break through poverty, education is their only chance.  Family will provide help and support but for people who do not have education in their family background, education is their only chance of breaking through intergenerational poverty.  That is why a provision such as this is so wrong and elitist.  It goes against anything that education is supposed to achieve that because someone's father went to a certain school, that person has a better chance of attending it.<\/p> <p>  For someone who is not from this country or from a particular area and does not come from a tradition of school attendance, having any of these factors as a reason for not being able to attend a certain school would, as I said, have a lifelong effect.  It would also make that person feel that regardless of any genuine efforts to try to row in or to move into the mainstream, for example, by changing their accent or pretending to live somewhere else, changing the way they dress or cut their hair, they will never be let into the club because their father did not go to a certain school.  I imagine that would make some young people pretty angry, even if that is only one person.  <\/p> <p>  I saw some heads nodding when I brought up the contradiction within the Bill.  Does anyone wish to speak to that?  Apart from the emotional argument I made, there is also the legislative argument that it is legislative nonsense to have two provisions in the same Bill aspiring to two different things.

However, when we talk to parents we find that choosing the schools they want their child to go to or not go to is a complex issue for parents.  The majority of parents will tell us it is a reputational thing and they want their child to go to the best school, as seen academically.  However, we also have parents who have other reasons for choosing a particular school.  The school may do a lot of sport or look after their child better because it seems to be a caring school or whatever else.  We need to make sure, when we are looking at the types of schools that parents are choosing for their children, that all schools can provide all of those things, rather than just looking at an educational reputation piece.  When we listen to parents' reasons for choosing a school, they are very complex.  In addition, for different children in the same family, there can be different reasons.

I do not have many questions but I have some observations.  My degree was in law and I learned some of the rules of interpretation.  One of them is called the mischief rule of interpretation, which is the idea that one is trying to interpret something on the basis of the mischief it is trying to achieve or the problem it is trying to resolve.<\/p><p> I have heard of the Stokes case.  The objective of this legislation is to try to address that type of mischief.  Some of the discussion last week was around how frequently the issue in question arises.  In many respects, it does not arise very frequently, but the existence of the Stokes alone case justifies a response.  We do not know whether John Stokes would have got access to the Christian Brothers High School Clonmel if this rule had not been in place.  It has been clearly demonstrated that his chance of accessing the school was significantly diminished.  The existence of that case alone justifies the legislation.<\/p><p> In many parts of the country, enrolment policies are not a problem because schools are not oversubscribed.  That is how we would want it to be.  I have some sympathy with the argument made by some of the speakers last week that what we need to do ultimately is resolve the issue of inadequate supply of school places, which is a particular problem in the greater Dublin area, Wicklow, Kildare, Cork city, Limerick city and many of the big urban centres.  That is probably going to get worse before it gets better because there is a demographic bulge at primary level that is going to transition into second level.  Subsequently, it might, perhaps, be alleviated.  Ultimately, if there is going to be pressure on places, we need to resolve that issue, but there has to be equality in terms of how a limited number of places are going to be allocated.<\/p><p> I reiterate my support the legislation.  In terms of additional issues related to admissions, a good point was made last week by the Joint Managerial Body in regard to a potential two-year admissions process for children with special educational needs in light of some of the documentation and so on that is needed.  In terms of managing the transition, that is a fair point if any of the witnesses would like to offer observations on it.  There is an issue.  If people are living in an area where places are in short supply it is reasonable for them to try as many options as possible.  What is not reasonable is that once they are offered a number of places they are holding on that number of places.  There needs to be a cut-off in that regard.<\/p><p> I have a specific question for Ms Lynch of National Parents Council Primary in regard to an issue that I raised last week as well.  School planning areas are quite often large.  They can take in several towns.  A school can be located at one end of the school planning area.  This is mostly an issue for new schools.  This can mean that a child who is living within 2 km or 3 km of a school could be of a lower priority than a child who lives 15 miles down the road but who is still within the school planning area.  Dr. Muldoon may have come across this as well.  We need to figure out a more flexible approach in that regard such as, perhaps, a school that is on the edge of school planning area being able apply to the Department for a derogation and being able to identify its correct catchment area.  For me, the priority in terms of access needs to be the local child.  It has been well articulated that the children who could lose out in respect of this issue are those whose parents did not attend secondary school in Ireland and the children of Travellers and migrants who did not attend secondary school.  The local child needs to be at the heart of it.<\/p><p> I reiterate my support for the legislation.  I would welcome a response from the witnesses on the points I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022020800002#F00900","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1644278400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>On the two-year period for children with special educational needs, more planning is needed, but is about putting more resources into that area rather than extending the process to two years on the basis that one does not want to inadvertently disadvantage children with special educational needs because all of a sudden their parents have to make a choice much earlier.  A great deal can happen within families in two years.  We need to make sure there are no unintended consequences of any decisions.  It would be better for applications to be processed with more resources, better planning and earlier planning with regard to the child's needs.<\/p> <p>  On the school planning, I know of a lot of areas where this issue arises.  In one case, a new housing development is across the road from a school but it is not in the catchment area of that school.  It is exactly as described by the Deputy.  It is similar to the situation described by Ms Fanning in regard to Wexford where the local principals have come together to work that through.  I agree with the Deputy that we need a better process in place for schools to manage that such that local principals do not have to organise it themselves.

We have seen this occur a couple of times in terms of that transition.  Often, all of the supports that are in place at primary level do not necessarily transition to post-primary level or the particular school the child is to go to.  Parents often find that they have to condense all of their decisions and they have to do a great deal of footwork themselves to ascertain whether those supports can be put in place in the school in which the child has been enrolled or in the school into which he or she has been accepted.

I listened remotely to what were very convincing arguments and all of the witnesses put fairness and equity at the centre of all they said.  I was struck by one particular comment, I think from Dr. Doyle, that no child's education should be impacted negatively because of his or her parents.  That is 100% correct.  The onus is on all of us to ensure that every child has an opportunity to excel in education in their own community.<\/p> <p>  From from my own experience of as a former teacher I know how important it is for all children that in every school, fee-paying or otherwise, we have a multicultural environment and a diverse classroom in terms of learning how we all deal with the world and our mixed society.  Dr. Muldoon made the point that we do not have the correct data.<\/p><p>Obviously, the real issue is that 20% of our schools are over-subscribed.  We should not have such a situation but we do and that is where is it at.  <br\/><br\/>We must deal with that 20%, no matter who the cohort is that will not have the opportunity to go their local school.  Last week it was suggested, and I agree, that we need to look at the timelines in relation to how parents and young people apply to schools.  It was suggested that it needs to be brought forward by at least 12 months so that people are not in a highly pressurised situation 12 months before school starts.  I also believe there must be some type of centralised system.  Many primary schools work together with a central admissions policy group but that is not happening at second level.  It can happen in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>or informal way but it is not happening in a formal way.  It is my belief that the Department of Education has a role to play in that and should be doing that.<br\/><br\/>In Newbridge, where I live, we have a huge problem with over-subscription that has been going on for about three years.  It is expected to continue for at least another two years until a new school is built.  Following a lot of pressure, agreement has been reached that somebody within the Department will work with the schools on the ground and with public representatives to make sure that every student has a place in secondary school next September.  The stress that it is causing for young people and their families is enormous.  It is not right and it absolutely should not be happening.  We had to push hard to get that from the Department but it is something that should be in place as a matter of course.<br\/><br\/>If there is over-subscription, what is the fairest way of dealing with it within a school or school community?

At present people are applying to schools they do not live near and that changes the demographic of people who are applying.  It creates an opportunity for those schools so we will change things that way.  One assumes that the people who stop applying or who are not allowed to apply outside their area will then be available to other schools.  That changes things.<br\/><br\/>In terms of avoiding over-subscription <i>per se<\/i>, we have argued for many years that it requires forward planning and population planning.  That is something that every other country in Europe is well able to do.  They plan ahead, recognise where the population growth is going to be and allow for that.  We need to put a better system in place in that regard.  We need to develop the resources that will allow that to happen.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the subscription piece, there are criteria out there.  I was looking at the submissions that were made last week.  There are 220 post-primary schools in the ETB network and 27 community national school.  Only eight of those use the past pupil condition and only two had to invoke it.  There are criteria out there that people are using all of the time that are suitable and appropriate.  I am not going to name them all but I think most people are comfortable with the idea of a sibling so that families are not split up.  There are also discussions about mixed gender as opposed to single gender schools which might change the way families are allowed to enter schools and where they look for schools.  Those sorts of things need to be considered.  The discussion is well on its way here but I am not going to lay down criteria.  Discussions with the educators who are currently involved, with the principals and the groups who appeared before the committee last week on the criteria are necessary.  There are four or five clear criteria, including locality and other areas can be looked at and clearly moved forward but the idea of past pupil just does not ring true.

Agreed. <\/p> <p>  In accordance with Standing Orders, members would be aware at this stage, the discussion should be confined to the Estimates only.  Please do not veer onto wider matters.  There will be many opportunities throughout the year to do that.  <\/p> <p>  All members are aware of parliamentary privilege and parliamentary practice at this stage.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister to the committee and invite her to make an opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022020800002#C00800","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>It is good to be here in person.  I am seeking the committee's approval for the revised Estimates for the justice Vote group, to provide for much needed expenditure across the justice sector.<\/p> <p>  The Estimates provide for gross expenditure of &euro;3.153 billion across the six votes in the justice sector, &euro;2.883 billion of which is current expenditure and &euro;270 million is capital expenditure.  In addition, an amount of &euro;12.4 million in unspent capital from 2021 has been carried over to 2022, bringing the total capital allocation available to &euro;282.4 million.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the detail in respect of each of the individual votes, but the main objective of the funding in 2022 is protecting communities and supporting victims.  This is core to what we do in the Department of Justice.  The budgetary allocations reflect the ongoing and increased investment in supports for people and communities impacted by crime and also the broad range of services offered to the public, including by accelerating the digitisation of these services.<\/p> <p>  The gross expenditure estimate for Vote 20 - Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is &euro;2.062 billion, which amounts to 65% of the funding for the entire group.  This includes a capital allocation of &euro;146.5 million, which builds on capital expenditure of &euro;131 million in 2021.  The capital expenditure includes &euro;61 million in respect of the building programme, including the completion of the new Military Road, Dublin 8 development, &euro;72 million for ICT expenditure and &euro;12 million for investment in the Garda fleet, including in the region of 100 new Garda bikes. <\/p> <p>  In the region of 88% of the Garda current expenditure budget is pay and pensions related.  I am pleased that the funding for 2022 provides for a further 800 garda&iacute; to commence training and for the recruitment of an additional 400 Garda staff to free up more garda&iacute; for front-line duties.  It is intended the next competition for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will commence shortly. <\/p> <p>  The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, since 2017, approximately 840 Garda members have been released from posts not requiring Garda powers or expertise and their duties reassigned to Garda staff.  This has, in turn, facilitated the redeployment of Garda members to operational and front-line duties.  This process will continue in 2022.<\/p> <p>  The budgetary allocation for 2022 includes in the region of &euro;10 million for further investment in the new Garda uniform, which people will have seen this week, and an additional &euro;10.5 million for Garda operational expenditure, which includes provision for new mobile devices, equipment for a range of Garda specialist units as well as on-going training in relation to priority areas such as tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It also includes a specific once&ndash;off allocation of &euro;1.5 million to mark the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022.  This significant milestone in the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be rightly recognised and celebrated this year. <\/p> <p>  Before moving on from the Garda Vote, I want to acknowledge and thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its exemplary service through and during the pandemic and in the many ways An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to support communities throughout the country.  The work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is valued and appreciated by people throughout the country.  It is important that the work of the organisation continues to be supported and that Government is committed to this, particularly in the context of ongoing reform, which is both in the best interests of the public and of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a whole and each member who serves in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022020800002#C00900","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I do not want to interrupt the Minister's flow, but we might open up to comments under each head.

The new model will include a focus on community policing and severe crime, but also on HR, finance and ensuring those who have specialist training in certain areas are doing the work they need to do.

In light of so much of what we have focused on in recent weeks and months, including domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, the position on the use of body-worn cameras is clear.  The first few moments after a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appears on the scene are often the most important.  There will be very clear rules and guidelines on how the body-worn cameras will have to be used and on other elements that fall under the legislation.

As the Minister is aware, we are pushing everybody to use more public transport and stop using their cars.  I hope that is what will happen and that we will have the required infrastructure in place as we move forward, but we will have to ensure people can use public transport safely.  Many people, particularly young women, are afraid of their lives to go near DART stations and other such places after dark.  They will take a taxi and do anything other than do so.

I know in recent times, due to the issues the Deputy has just mentioned where we have had particular issues, unfortunately, many of them within the Dublin area as well as further afield, there have been specific targeted operations within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at certain times over weekends.

Notwithstanding that, it is something that will always be kept under review and, obviously, if a situation escalates that needs further consideration, that will be the case.

The budget is broken down into two separate programmes, the criminal and civil justice pillars, comprising almost 50 separate subheads.  The budgetary provision for 2022 enables a number of key priorities to be advanced and provides additional resources to a number of agencies and programmes in the civil and criminal justice sectors.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that it is possible to build on the investment in Estimates 2021 for victim supports and to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms.  This reflects the fact that tackling these crimes and supporting victims is a priority for this Government.  Over the past 12 months, we have made good progress in tackling and raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An integral part of this has been in working closely with our front-line partners and taking a sectoral approach to the issues, and we want to continue this.<\/p> <p>  In 2022, we will provide over &euro;1 million to the Legal Aid Board to provide for legal advice and services in court to victims of sexual violence.  Over &euro;1 million will be provided to the Garda to upgrade its divisional protective service units.  Some &euro;5.3 million will be provided for awareness-raising initiatives, including knowing the signs, what supports are available etc.  In addition, &euro;4.9 million is being provided to support victims of crime groups.  A significant proportion of this is earmarked for the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence area.  The &euro;5.3 million also deals with training, which I touched on earlier with Deputy Carroll MacNeill.<\/p> <p>  The Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 was launched in 2021.  The immediate priority within the new strategy is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 youth diversion projects, YDPs, across the State.  The additional &euro;6.7 million provided for in the Estimates represents an increase of one third in support for youth services.  Apologies, I said \"doubled\" earlier.  It provides the resources to kick-start delivery of key objectives in the youth justice strategy and, in particular, the programme to expand and deepen the range of supports available through local YDP services.<\/p> <p>  The budget of Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, is over &euro;56.5 million in 2022.  This includes a capital allocation of &euro;30.5 million to complete the development of a new state-of-the-art laboratory in Backweston, County Kildare.  Despite the impact of the Covid restrictions, in the region of over &euro;69 million was spent on this project over the past two years.  A number of other agencies in the criminal justice sector received additional funding.  The Criminal Assets Bureau received &euro;900,000 with its total allocation being &euro;10.9 million.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission received an additional &euro;2.1 million, which brings the total allocation to &euro;13.4 million.  This reflects the increased workload in terms of volume and complexity which the commission is dealing with.  Increased resources have also been made available to the Inspector of Prisons of &euro;400,000, bringing the total allocation to &euro;2.35 million, and the Parole Board now has a total allocation of &euro;1.74 million, which reflects the expanded remit of this body following its establishment as a statutory agency in July 2021.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that the community safety innovation fund has been established in the justice Vote in 2022.  An amount of &euro;2 million has been provided in 2022.  A call for funding proposals will issue seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from the new local community safety partnerships.  Applications will be assessed against criteria outlined in the call for proposals to ensure funding is allocated to encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety, from people who understand local community safety-needs best and to avoid duplication with other services.  The new fund will reflect the significant successes of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau in disrupting criminal activity and seizing proceeds of crime, by providing additional funding for investment in community safety projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022020800002#E00600","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>We will now take questions and comments on Vote 24 - Justice.

It is intended that victims who previously did not have access to or were not able to afford legal support going through the court process, would have access to that from the beginning when they decide to take that difficult step of coming forward and seeking help.  It is the intention that they would have access to legal advice and would be able to make the decision whether or not to process, move forward, or go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The increased funding is to acknowledge the significant work that is carried out by the Inspector of Prisons and to acknowledge the workload which is still increasing and will increase further, based on the OPCAT legislation the Deputy mentioned.<\/p> <p>  We have a framework for the Inspector of Prisons being developed.  Launched in September 2020, it sets out how we conduct inspections of prisons in Ireland.  It is informed by statutory underpinning of the legislation.  We have national legislation relating to prisoners and prisoners' rights as well.  All of this comes under the remit of the inspector.  It also draws upon the relevant International human rights standards, in particular the preventative approach and standards set out by OPCAT and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<\/p> <p>  In the next year or two, all places of detention will be included in the remit for the inspector, not just prisons but perhaps also Garda stations where people are detained.  A number of things are happening in regard to upgrading our legislation, ratifying certain European protocols and ensuring that when this change takes place, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons will have the capacity to take on this additional workload on top of its already difficult workload.

Significant work is being done on the new strategy and the link with how services have been covered with Tusla.  On a related point in respect of the youth justice strategy and the Garda youth diversion office, one of the big problems over the years has been follow-up with Tusla where a decision is taken not to prosecute a child but to refer him or her for therapy, counselling or Tusla-based welfare follow-ups.  Historically, the monitoring of the follow-up has been weak.  I am flagging more than anything else because I know so much has been invested in the youth justice strategy.  We need to make sure those Tusla follow-ups are monitored in some way to ensure they take place.  There is not much point in choosing not to prosecute a child because he or she needs a welfare-based intervention if nobody checks how the decision is followed up.<\/p> <p>  Similarly with the prisons, as Deputy Costello mentioned, there has not been a report of the Inspector of Prisons report for some time for various reasons, which is a pity.

I note the increase in funding for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  One of the biggest difficulties many people have with GSOC is that the inquiries it carries out often require that it second members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from other areas to do investigations.  There is certainly an impression among people who make complaints.  We are all adults and we know that people who do not get a satisfactory outcome to their complaint are not going to be satisfied.  However, some people have a grievance that they believe to be legitimate feel they are not dealt with appropriately.  Part of that is the way in which these inquiries are carried out.  I hope GSOC will have its own staff to do this kind of work, that these staff will be properly trained and that GSOC will have a greater level of independence and separation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than is currently the case.  I invite the Minister to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I will raise relates to the Mental Health Criminal Law Review Board.  Many people who work in the criminal justice system, whether in the courts or in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, see that many of the repeat offenders who come before the courts have difficulties with addiction and mental health.  Many of these difficulties are interlinked, for example, people may have become psychotic because of drug addiction.  There is a range of issues there.  At the moment, the services available to such people are poor.  It is widely recognised that while some improvements have occurred in recent years, we are still a long way from a satisfactory situation in regard to that.  The zero increase in funding for the review board, which I accept only considers cases, reflects the huge amount of work to be done to bring this area up to the standard needed to protect people with mental health problems who end up before the courts and often in jail where they should not be.<\/p><p>There is a huge amount of work to be done in respect of bringing that up to the standard that we need to protect people who have mental health problems, end up before the courts system and often end up in jail, where they should not be at all.  It compounds their condition and destroys their lives, in effect, in many cases.  It is a real issue that we need to look at.<\/p><p> The other issue I wish to raise concerns the crime prevention measures.  There is zero increase in respect of that.  I point to the case that is ongoing at the moment in my own constituency in Sligo.  It concerns an elderly man who was attacked in his home recently and is currently on life support.  The garda&iacute; are doing their best to find the culprits.  However, it has certainly heightened that sense of fear and vulnerability among elderly people, particularly those living alone in rural and isolated areas.  While it may not be under the remit of the Minister's Department, I suggest that from somewhere in government, additional measures need to be put in place in respect of  providing security, greater protection and perhaps cameras and that type of thing.  Assistance should be provided for pensioners who are alone in rural areas to help them to get a greater sense of security around that.  That is not to separate the issue from the fact that we need more garda&iacute; and, of course, a more visible Garda presence in rural areas.  That is certainly a direction that we need to go in.  I will leave it at that for the moment, but I will come back with other questions afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022020800002#F01700","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>On GSOC, acknowledging the workload and the need to continuously expand and support the work that it does, the budget has increased by around 19% from last year.  That is quite a significant increase.  I believe the budget has increased by &euro;2.133 million, bringing it to &euro;13.406 million.  GSOC is obviously independent in its function and its work.  What we will be moving to do in the new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which is obviously quite a significant Bill looking at all areas of reform across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is to strengthen the role of GSOC as an ombudsman.  Obviously, there will be particular discussion happening in the months ahead on that reform and how we can make sure that GSOC, remaining independent, has the supports, the structures and the legislative support that it needs to continue to do its job to the best of its ability.<\/p> <p>  On the mental health element, it was a programme for Government commitment to establish a task force to look at mental health in our prisons.  I suppose it is about looking at what is often a revolving door situation, where people come in and out.  When they leave, they do not have the appropriate supports and they are in contact with the Probation Service.  We must look at what can we do.  I and the Minister for Health, along with the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Feighan, have come together with our Departments.  There is a group that is being chaired by Kathleen Lynch, the former Minister of State with special responsibility for primary care, mental health and disability.  For the past year, the group has been looking at all elements of this right down to the type of support that is provided in prisons.  We know that there are many people who are not appropriately housed.  They should be in Dundrum or perhaps other facilities, but there is not the scope or the space for them.  We must also ensure that the appropriate supports are there for those who do need to be in prison and that they are supported when they come out into the community.  In terms of the spend and the requirement from that, we will have recommendations in the coming months from the task force.  Some of that will fall under my own remit, most likely in the areas of probation and the prison service, but a lot of it will also fall under the remit of the Department of Health.  That is why there are three Ministers in the Department who are very much involved in that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of crime prevention, this morning I spoke of what happened in the last few days.  It is unthinkable than a man living on his own in his home, who had every right to feel and to be safe, was attacked viciously.  We need to take a number of actions here.  We need to make sure that our Garda numbers continue to increase.  As I outlined at the outset, that is happening.  There will be an additional 800 garda&iacute; this year, 100 of whom are just coming out of Templemore.  We must ensure that those who are working behind desks but should be out on the ground are allowed to do just that.  That is why there will be an increase in civilian staff also.  We must ensure that there are focused and targeted operations in our towns, villages and rural areas.  Operation Thor, which has been under way for some time now, is specifically focusing on supporting and protecting rural communities.  We also need to focus on the new development of the community safety partnerships, which will allow individual communities to identify what it is that they need and want to help keep themselves safe.  The issue of cameras has obviously been very much discussed in recent weeks.  In that regard, there is work that needed to be done, because of new GDPR legislation that came into force in 2018, to ensure that the councils working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community groups can apply the law in the correct way.  We must ensure that where surveillance is required or where community groups seek to have cameras put up in their locality, they are in line with national and European legislation, and that they support the Garda to do the work that it needs to do, while also protecting people's rights and their right to their own privacy.  There are a number of issues to consider here.  The incident to which the Deputy referred should not have happened.  It should not be tolerated.  I might ask anyone who has information, no matter how small they might feel it is, to come forward.  It is an ongoing investigation, and supporting the Garda in that regard is hugely important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022020800002#G00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her presentation today.  I have a few questions.  On the &euro;1 million that has been provided for the Garda to upgrade its divisional protective services units, will the Minister expand on that for us?  I listened very attentively this morning to the Minister's interview on \"Morning Ireland\" regarding last night's documentary on RT&Eacute;.  I am conscious of the fact that my own constituency is one of the areas that does not have a refuge for women.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say that she intends to almost quadruple the number of beds that are available for women and families who find themselves in that situation.  Is that part of the &euro;4.9 million in extra funding that is being provided?  I also listened very attentively to the Minister saying that she will be leading on a response to domestic violence.  The issue crosses so manyDepartments.   It is an issue that was very clearly presented here by Safe Ireland and Mary McDermott when she spoke about the fact that there are so many different Government Departments that feed into the issue, including the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I ask the Minister to provide us with details on how the work is coming together.  Are we finally going to have one Department that will be responsible for addressing the issue in an adequate way, so that organisations such as Safe Ireland have one Department that they can go to, or are we still going to be in a situation where three or four different Departments deal with the issue?  On the Tusla report that we are still waiting on, does the Minister have any idea when that will be coming to Cabinet?  When will the full audit of where the gaps are be completed?<\/p> <p>  My last question concerns the community safety innovation fund.  It is very welcome.  I am wondering if that will support local community crime prevention groups.  I am thinking, in particular, of the local crime prevention community groups that feed into our joint policing committees and local authorities.  They do not actually have any funds, so they have to look further afield.  For example, in respect of the property marking scheme and the provision of signage for it, unless the Garda and the local authority have that support, they do not have any source of funds.  Perhaps the Minister could expand on that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022020800002#G00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The &euro;1 million in funding is an acknowledgement of the fact that while some of the divisional protective service units have been up and running for a number of years, there are many that were only established in the last year.  It is provided to ensure that those who are working in the units have adequate provisions and the resources that they need.  Some will require additional building capacity and space.  That is something that we can address as part of the wider capital plan.  The &euro;1 million funding is simply to make sure that those who are working in a very difficult area &ndash; because this is not just about looking at domestic and sexual violence, but historic and current sexual abuse cases, online child sex abuse and all of these different areas &ndash; have the relevant technology, equipment, resources and support that they need.  Touching on Deputy Kenny's point, unfortunately, we will probably need more funding to build on that in the years to come.  The &euro;1 million funding is very much an acknowledgement that we need to start.<\/p> <p>  On the &euro;5.4 million, the funding that is currently in my Department for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence totals around &euro;13 million.  None of that is for refuge or delivery of services.  All of that funding comes under Tusla.  Last year, &euro;30 million was spent on the delivery of services to accommodate around 140 spaces.  We will need a multiple of that.  In the coming weeks, the responsibility for the delivery of service and refuge space will move to the Department of Justice.  We will set out very clearly what that structure will look like and how we intend to deliver those services.  The accommodation review will be brought to Cabinet next week.  As part of the process, I will meet with front-line workers and the community and voluntary sector to go through the accommodation review with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, because it is still very much part of his Department with Tusla.

Are there plans to recruit more investigators from overseas?  I ask because it is unsatisfactory for an inspector or a superintendent from a neighbouring district to conduct an investigation.  Whether an investigation is done properly, there is the perception sometimes that it is not fully independent.

I know a huge amount of work and focus, within the legislation, acknowledges the online element of gambling and how it has changed form in recent years.

Representatives of different groups have appeared before our committee, and before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and have spoken about the difficulty with access to justice because of a lack of translation services.  These services can be <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  My experience in using translators is that sometimes they can be excellent, while at other times they can be deeply unprofessional.  There is no overarching mechanism to regulate this area.

I was talking to one barrister who practises in criminal law who had a bail hearing in January this year and the trial is scheduled for March 2024.  There is a huge backlog.  The impact of Covid-19 is contributing to this but so is a lack of judges.  This is the case at all levels of the judicial system.  The President of the High Court asked for an additional 17 judges and we were able to give her five more.  Equally, the District Court and the Circuit Court have as much of a demand for the allocation of more judges.  The addition of judges with no fixed circuit or district would mean they could move around and go to where the backlogs are to help us to be more flexible.  I am aware that I cannot fully appreciate if that is possible under the current structures, but something like that is desperately needed to ensure that someone will not be waiting for two and a half years for a trial.

I accept the Deputy's point that a lack of access to a translator means that it is not possible for someone to realise their right to have a fair trial and due process.  I will follow this up with the Courts Service.<\/p> <p>  Regarding judges, we were able to allocate six new High Court judges following the request that was made.  I appreciate, however, that is not enough in the context of the overall structure and system.  A group chaired by Brigid McManus is looking at the overall number of judges and how many might ultimately be required.  The group is also examining new types of structures and court structures which will have specialised judges.  My Department and I are also working towards a new family courts Bill, which will identify new courts' structures specifically for family law cases.  We wish to have specific judges who will only be working on family law issues and who are trained in this area.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, we must do several things.  We must increase the number of judges and increase specialisation among judges.  Equally, we must maintain the changes which have occurred in respect of modernisation.

I think the payment for the Criminal Courts of Justice, CCJ, takes up about &euro;27 million of that total, but I could be corrected on that figure.  Does the Minister think this spending is still good value for money?  It seems to be the model that is entrenched in the Department for the construction of any future court buildings.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to Tralee Courthouse.  In that context, I welcome and look forward to the proposed family law changes.  I also welcome the amendments and changes that have facilitated the smooth running of the courts during this pandemic, such as the remote hearings, which have helped victims and witnesses.  Even prisoners do not have to travel for relatively mundane remands.  The situation on the ground in Kerry, however, is that the forthcoming Circuit Court criminal trials, which commence for five weeks at the end of this month, are still going to be held in Limerick.  It means that members of the Garda, witnesses, family members, and defendants must all travel out of the county.  That is inconvenient for the people involved and for criminal justice.<\/p><p>It is not good for business around the town because business from juries and everyone else involved in the courts is leaving the county.<\/p><p> Could the Minister give a commitment that criminal trials will be returned to Tralee as soon as possible?  I did put a proposal to the head of the Courts Service prior to Christmas, which was to go before the buildings committee in December, to say there is another building available across the road, the old Kerry Protestant Hall, which could be used for family law.  Has that alternative been considered yet by the Courts Service in order that we could refurbish the existing court building?  That would free up the Island of Geese site for other positive additional benefits to the town centre, following on from the Government commitment to invest in town centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2022020800002#K01400","speaker":"1488","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1644278400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>On the PPP, this applies not just to the courts' capital programme but also to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well.

It is important that we are commencing such significant projects, Hammond Lane being one example, and that we know there is a start, middle and end and that when the projects finish they will come in on time and, most importantly, on budget.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the criminal trials, we met with the Courts Service in the past week, and we were assured that they would resume.  It is important that there is a phased return where there is still a level of uncertainty and people who are vulnerable, in particular when juries are being sworn in, as we have seen with work in various Departments the length and breadth of the country.  The intention is that criminal trials will resume in their original courthouses as soon as possible.  It is being done on a phased basis for the very reasons I have outlined, namely, that there are still people who are vulnerable and there is still Covid.  We must take all of that into account.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a lot of engagement locally in respect of Tralee courthouse between the council, the OPW and my Department.

The Minister will also be aware of the ongoing debate and concerns as to the effectiveness and capacity of the Irish Data Protection Office to manage effectively all of Europe's data sets.  By extension, there is a potential threat to our economic offering, which is grounded in having tech centres and multinational tech companies in Ireland because it is the gateway to Europe in those jurisdictions.  If there was to be any slippage in terms of those operations looking elsewhere, including for data protection regimes, as is beginning to happen in certain quarters in Europe, that could jeopardise our economic offering.  It is a specific concern for a number of reasons.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the committee's report on this from last year.  I welcome the increased funding of 25%.  That is positive.
