This involves a transition period being agreed until the end of 2020, and a free trade agreement being agreed thereafter.  <\/p><p>However, I am conscious that the nature of the UK&rsquo;s exit remains uncertain, and that the risks of a harder Brexit have increased.  An assessment of the potential outcomes is included in the <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook <\/i>that accompanied <i>Budget 2019<\/i>.<\/p><p>In the short-term, a no-deal hard Brexit would have a material impact on Ireland, which would be asymmetric relative to the rest of the EU.  The resulting shock would likely lead to market volatility, further sterling depreciation, and disruption to trade with the UK.  This would have negative impacts for consumer spending, investment and competitiveness, with potential spillovers to the labour market and public finances.  Sectors with strong export ties to the UK, such as agri-food and parts of manufacturing (especially indigenous manufacturing), would be especially exposed, in particular at the regional level. <\/p><p>With regard to the long term impact, joint research by my Department and the ESRI published in 2016 shows that the potential impact of a hard Brexit is significant.  The level of GDP would be almost 4 per cent below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario, after ten years.  The level of employment in Ireland would be 2 per cent lower, with the unemployment rate nearly 2 percentage points higher. <\/p><p>It is important to stress that the economic models may not fully capture the full impact, given the difficulty in modelling financial market effects, non-tariff barriers and other factors.  Therefore, these quantitative effects should be seen as a minimum as opposed to a maximum impact.<\/p><p>The Government is working hard with the EU Taskforce and our EU partners to ensure that an agreement between the EU and the UK is reached.

Extensive restrictions are in place and from the outset let us be clear these are not simply confined to a handful of senior bankers whose pay is restricted by the &euro;500,000 pay cap (excluding a standard pension contribution). These affect c.23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The Policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks. <\/p>  <p>  A new regulatory framework has been put in place since the financial crisis across the EU, the economy has returned to near full employment, the remaining banks are profitable again &ndash; and in the case of AIB and BOI sustainably so. The State remains the largest shareholder in AIB, BOI &amp;amp; PTSB but following the successful IPO of AIB in June 2017 all three banks are also now on an equal footing with listings on the main market of the Irish and London stock exchanges.  <\/p>  <p>  The skill set required in the banking sector is evolving with the greatest demand for staff now in areas such as the digital economy, risk management, legal and compliance. These skills are in demand right across the economy and so the banks are competing for this talent against companies who have more flexible and attractive remuneration structures. Brexit has only made this problem more acute.<\/p>  <p>  In the senior ranks of the banks the substantial disparity in pay levels versus other Irish listed companies or peer banks in Europe is stark and introduces an obvious retention risk particularly in AIB and Bank of Ireland. I also need to be advised if this retention risk and a lack of alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders, undermines the Government's objective of recovering the State&rsquo;s full investment in the banks.  <\/p>  <p>  My department held a full open EU public procurement to select a suitably qualified external consultant to assist the Department of Finance in completing this review of Government policy.

Expenditure outside of Ireland does not qualify for the tax credit.  However, where the credit is calculated based on 80% of the total cost of production, Revenue must have regard to the amounts incurred outside of the State as an increased global budget can lead to an increased credit.   <\/p>  <p>  Recognising the potential risks presented, the administrative framework of the relief requires that a company&rsquo;s application for the credit must include:<\/p>  <p>  firstly an auditor&rsquo;s report detailing the eligible expenditure, the global budget and details of related party transactions, and secondly a solicitor&rsquo;s letter detailing that they have reviewed the legal agreements and that 68% of the funding has been lodged to the company&rsquo;s bank account (a requirement prior to Revenue releasing any amounts of the payable tax credit). <\/p>  <p>  Section 481 provides that Revenue may refuse to certify a film if they have reason to believe that the budget, or any part of the budget, is inflated.

These guidelines indicate that tax expenditures should only be used in limited circumstances of demonstrable market failure, and where a tax based incentive is likely to be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. <\/p><p>In relation to the particular incentive being proposed by the Deputy, I understand that there is already a targeted direct expenditure measure in operation under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, i.e. the Repair and Leasing Scheme. <\/p><p>I am advised that this scheme, developed under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. The scheme provides upfront funding for any works necessary to bring the property up to the required standard, and in return the property owner agrees to lease the dwelling to the local authority to be used as social housing.<\/p><p>In relation to taxation measures which are targeted at increasing the supply of property available in the rented residential sector, as the Deputy may be aware, in 2017 my Department published a report on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers. Ten policy options were put forward in the report, divided into short-term, medium-term and long-term timeframes. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019. <\/p><p>In Budget 2018, I introduced one of these measures: <i>deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties.<\/i>This option was prioritised as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises and applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property. The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. <\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA03700"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[44219\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will introduce a simplified process by which small and medium enterprises can avail of the research and development tax credit.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>There are no specific provisions for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the research and development (R&amp;D) tax credit, and nor are there any restrictions for SMEs wishing to avail of the scheme.

Some of you here will remember when betting tax was 20% of turnover. In fact, the last time the betting duty rate increased was in 1975. Furthermore, it is also worth pointing out that the standard bookmaker&rsquo;s licence fee, at &euro;500 for a two year period, is modest and has not increased since 1992.  I appreciate the concerns raised by the betting sector following the budget. However, this increase must be seen in the context of the rate being at an all-time low.

It is also important that Ireland has a healthy commercial banking system that is able to provide finance to customers and has an ability to withstand economic and financial market shocks.  This means it must be in a position to generate sustainable profits over the long term to absorb credit losses over the credit cycle while still generating capital.  <\/p>  <p>  While we can see that Irish mortgage rates are higher relative to the eurozone average interest rate, there are a number of factors that impact on the level of interest rates.   In Ireland, it is unfortunate that the mis-pricing of risks in historical lending continues to be a significant burden, as evidenced by the continued high level of non-performing loans, the prevalence of very low yielding tracker mortgages, and low net interest margins.  There is also the issue of reduced competition with fewer banks in the system compared to a decade ago and the largest operators have a significant share of the mortgage market.  <\/p>  <p>  The residential mortgage market comprises, amongst other things, fixed interest rate mortgages, loan to value managed variable rate mortgages, trackers and restructured mortgages of various types, etc.  Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed by only looking at standard variable rate mortgages and any assessment would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of what I can do as Minister, the European Central Bank sets the monetary policy for the Eurozone as a whole and the Central Bank of Ireland does not have a statutory role in prescribing the rates that mortgage lenders charge on their loans.  I too have no statutory function in relation to the commercial decisions made by individual lending institutions, including decisions on the level of interest applicable on mortgage or other financial products offered by banks.     <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has carried out research, which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has launched a mortgage switching tool for consumers that notes the findings of the Central Bank research of cases where borrowers could make savings.  I strongly urge consumers to utilise these tools and information to enable them to available of better rates.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that increased competition and making it easier to switch ones mortgage, rather than administrative controls, remain the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ireland Strategic Investment Fund Investments","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA05000"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[43978\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether consideration should be given to diverting &euro;1.5 billion of excess funds in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to develop the State&rsquo;s infrastructure further to a report by his Department in advance of budget 2019.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>While published as part of the Budget 2019 documents on Tuesday 9 October last the Department&rsquo;s Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) Review was concluded in 2017.

Lorraine Corcoran, Director, Afanite<\/p><p>2. Olive McCarthy, Senior Lecturer in University College Cork (UCC) <\/p><p>3. Seamus Newcombe, Chief Executive, Payac Services CLG<\/p><p>4. Diarmaid O&rsquo;Keeffe, Head of Audit, EisenAmper Ireland<\/p><p>The new members are in addition to two existing members of CUAC, both credit union managers, who have good credit union management and restructuring experience. The new CUAC now consists of six members and provide a good balance with backgrounds in credit union management, restructuring, academia, accounting and financial experience.  <\/p><p>I am satisfied that each appointed member of the CUAC has the requisite experience and knowledge of credit union matters and will make a valuable contribution towards dealing with the challenges facing the sector at this important time for the Irish credit union movement.  <\/p><p>The new committee met for the first time on 15 October 2018. The Committee is currently considering an indicative work plan for the next few years and will report to me on progress when this is in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Services","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA06600"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[44217\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA06700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress that has been made in putting in place a strategy for the development of growth for credit unions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[44116\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA06800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to develop a new strategy for the growth and development of the credit union sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 58 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a clear policy to support the strategic growth and development of credit unions delivering the comprehensive recommendations set out in the Commission on Credit Unions Report and the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) report in 2016, both of which involved extensive stakeholder engagement. CUAC remains an important advisor to me on strategic issues facing the sector, and the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are priorities for this Government.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2011 my Department has put in place a number of measures to assist the credit union sector. These measures include: <\/p>  <p>  - establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions in 2011; <\/p>  <p>  - publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012; <\/p>  <p>  - establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, which oversaw 82 restructuring projects involving 156 credit unions during its lifetime: these newly merged credit unions are now better positioned to harness the efficiencies of their increased scale to prudently develop products and services that their members are looking for now, and into the future;<\/p>  <p>  - availability of &euro;250 million for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo;<\/p>  <p>  - establishment of a stabilisation levy to support credit unions that are undercapitalised but are otherwise viable; and<\/p>  <p>  - establishment of a Resolution Fund for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, a Credit Union, as well as the provision of &euro;250 million in 2011 to meet resolution costs anticipated at the time.<\/p>  <p>  More recently, on the basis of a CUAC recommendation, an Implementation Group was established to oversee and monitor the implementation of the CUAC Report&rsquo;s recommendations. The group, which meets monthly, is chaired by my Department and consists of one member from each of the representative bodies, one member from the CUAC and a member from the Central Bank. This group is an important forum for key stakeholders in the Credit Union Sector and has submitted papers on long-term lending and consultation and engagement to the Central Bank. The Implementation Group is expected to issue a final report to me in December 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, following consultation with the Credit Union sector, revised regulations for credit unions commenced on 1 March 2018 which make changes to the investment and liquidity requirements and allow for greater diversification of investment income, including provision for up to c. &euro;700 million investment in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies via a regulated vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  While there are challenges to returns arising from the low yield environment and low loan to asset ratios, the sector continues to show signs of improvement reflected in growth in new lending, delivering c 35% of all unsecured consumer lending in 2017, a decrease in the level of reported arrears and an increase in reserves. Total assets have increased consistently for many years and currently stand at approximately &euro;17.5 billion. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is due to publish a Consultation Paper in Q4 2018, as part of its review of the current long term lending limits for Credit Unions which may facilitate improvement in loan to asset ratios. <\/p>  <p>  Business model development is another challenge facing the sector and to this end the Central Bank has set up a dedicated Business Model Unit within the Registrar of Credit Unions and has developed initiatives such as the CEO forum to address key constraints to, and enablers for, business model development. Business model development is also a focus of the CUAC, and I have specifically requested the committee to review barriers to and supports for collaborative efforts as well as SME lending, linking with the outcomes of the Local Public Banking report.<\/p>  <p>  This Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and its priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall. The Government is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. Credit unions are member owned and it is these members, with support from their representative bodies, who ultimately are responsible for setting and implementing their own individual strategic plans, with appropriate support from Government, which reflect the diverse nature of credit unions be they urban or rural, large or small, industrial or community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA07000"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[44220\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA07100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of loan sales by State backed banks he and his predecessor have been notified of and not raised an objection to since February 2016; the value of these sales; and the number of principal dwelling houses included.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I, in my role as Minister for Finance, cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding.

In addition, Revenue in conjunction with the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation from April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The industry view is that the action taken has been successful in curtailing fuel fraud.  I am advised also that Revenue conducted random National Sampling Programmes in 2016 and 2017 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The programmes each involved nearly one in ten of circa 2,500 holders of auto fuel trader licences and tests of diesel samples taken from the randomly selected traders found no evidence of the new marker in any of them. The results of these sampling are a clear indication that Revenue&rsquo;s actions have resulted in the near elimination of the selling of laundered products at retail level. A further sampling programme, in 2018, was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector. Analysis from the results of this programme gave rise to three positive detections and investigation towards prosecution is now underway.<\/p>  <p>  Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the diversion of untaxed alcohol on to the market, through the production of counterfeit alcohol and through smuggling from countries with lower taxes. While there has been little evidence of large-scale illegal activity, as indicated by the low value of seizures in 2017 (&euro;0.91million) when set against the overall value of the alcohol market (&euro;6.1billion), Revenue remains vigilant and takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected. This action is informed by, inter alia, intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises. Key results of this activity include the seizure of almost 200,000 litres of beer, believed to be associated with diversion fraud since September 2017, the uncovering in November 2017 of a large-scale counterfeit vodka production plant processing highly dangerous denatured industrial alcohol and the detention in June 2018 at Dublin Port of a container carrying a quantity of raw alcohol with the capacity to produce over 50,000 litres of illicit alcohol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":78,"content":"<p>Question No. 35 answered with Question No. 29.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA07800"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[43965\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500050#WRA07900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress he is making with the NTMA to establish a funding vehicle capable of facilitating off-balance sheet investment in delivering social and private housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>In line with &ldquo;<i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>&rdquo; commitments, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and a number of key Government Departments examined the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle, in conjunction with the private sector to facilitate investment in social and affordable housing.<\/p><p>The objective was to create an 'off-balance sheet' mechanism which could facilitate investment additional to that being provided directly by the State and which would not impact on the General Government Balance.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals, nor am I in a position to direct them to provide cover to such individuals. <\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life assurance cover and what terms to apply.  These factors can include age, health, family medical history, occupation and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the length of time with which such a policy may last.  Furthermore, my understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and that they will price in accordance with their own past claims experience. <\/p>  <p>  In response to a broadly similar question on 3 October 2018, my officials sought the views of Insurance Ireland.  They advised that applicants for any type of life assurance will be asked on the application form detailed health questions and that insurers may request one or more of the following in addition: a report from the applicant&rsquo;s GP; an independent medical examination; or other medical tests.  On the basis of the information provided, the application is considered individually and the decision on whether to offer cover and on what terms depends on the facts of that particular case. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

The modernisation programme will bring improved accuracy and transparency for all stakeholders, including employers, employees and Revenue, while also significantly streamlining the entire administration process. To that end, the introduction of PAYE Modernisation by Revenue is both much needed and very welcome. <\/p><p>Since October 2016, when the project was launched, Revenue has worked extensively with all relevant stakeholders in a co-design approach, to ensure the new PAYE Modernisation reporting system reduces the administrative burden on employers to the greatest extent possible. For example, one of Revenue&rsquo;s key design principles is that employer reporting should be seamlessly integrated into the business&rsquo; payroll process. This will minimise the administrative burden on employers and allow their reporting obligations to Revenue to become a by-product of their payroll operation. In addition, the project will lead to the abolition of the current employer reporting obligations via P30, P35, P45, P46 and P60 forms. Revenue has advised me that employers have welcomed the abolition of these forms and the consequential reduction in the administrative burden. <\/p><p>All employers are currently obliged to calculate and make the correct statutory deductions from their employees&rsquo; salary payments each time they pay.  A significant number of employers, including small and medium employers, use payroll software to run their payroll and that will still be the case when PAYE Modernisation goes live on 1 January 2019. I am aware that Revenue has engaged extensively with the payroll software industry to ensure, as far as possible, that the necessary changes to their systems will be ready on time. Consequently, the processes for these employers before and after 1 January 2019 will be broadly similar. <\/p><p>For employers who do not use payroll software, Revenue is providing an easy-to-use process within the Revenue Online Service (ROS) to capture payroll data for each employee. The process includes data screens that the employer will be obliged to complete for each employee every time a pay-run is completed (normally weekly, fortnightly or monthly). The burden associated with this work will be offset to an extent by the abolition of the previously mentioned forms that operate under the current system. It is also very important to note that there is no change to current PAYE payment dates under the Modernisation programme.<\/p><p>I know that Revenue is very conscious that some employers may experience difficulties in the early phases of PAYE Modernisation and has assured me that it will make every effort to assist where required. For example, the Revenue Employer Helpdesk will have significant additional resources available to it to meet customer demand and officials will be available to visit employers should the need arise. Revenue has also assured me that it is not the intention to impose sanctions such as interest and penalties during the early transitional months where employers do their best to comply.

To do so would compromise a borrower's capacity to repay his or her debts to NAMA and would constitute a direct breach of the borrower's property rights, protected under Article 43 of the Constitution.  I am advised that directing NAMA to act counter to these obligations is not one lawfully open to me in all the current circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, there would be many legislative, balance sheet and State aid implications in repurposing NAMA away from its existing objectives.

In Ireland, the recently published Department of Finance Annual Report on Public Debt has identified that, as an overhang from the global financial crisis, outstanding public debt amounts to &euro;42,000 for every Irish resident or a Gross National Debt of circa &euro;215 billion as at the end of September 2018. This level is the third highest among the world&rsquo;s advanced economies. Given our significant debt legacy and in an increasingly unpredictable external environment, high levels of public indebtedness increase the vulnerability of the Irish economy to possible economic shocks. As part of a proactive and prudent strategy, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), as the Body responsible for managing Ireland&rsquo;s National Debt, has &rdquo;locked-in&rdquo; a substantial portion of our debt at the relatively low interest rates which have prevailed in recent years and also at longer maturities. By doing this, Ireland&rsquo;s risk of interest rate shock exposure is reduced. It also has to be borne in mind that reducing the level of public debt and preventing the build-up of additional debt are also extremely important policy priorities. Therefore, the NTMA in coordination with the Department of Finance publishes a target range for Ireland&rsquo;s planned borrowing annually, with auction schedules then released on a quarterly basis.<\/p>  <p>  Both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government continue to engage with the EIB on the issue of support for the social and affordable housing sector. In fact, the EIB has been actively supporting Ireland in this regard through inter-mediated loans to the Housing Finance Agency.

In the last five years the EIB has provided &euro;350 million for such investment in cooperation with the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware that my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and senior government officials visited the headquarters of the EIB earlier this year to discuss future social and affordable housing investment in Ireland, and to explore ways to broaden EIB support for new social housing investment in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, a pilot project for the development of cost rental affordable housing in Inchicore was announced. I understand that discussions between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the EIB are ongoing with regard to financing options for this project.

This can be done through such insurers either:<\/p>  <p>  - establishing a branch operation in the host country and thus conducting business on a &lsquo;freedom of establishment&rsquo; (FOE) basis; or <\/p>  <p>  - writing business from the home country (i.e. where authorised) into the host country on a &lsquo;freedom of services&rsquo; (FOS) basis.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to conduct business in this fashion, the insurer is required to meet certain obligations in the host member state, such as becoming a member of the national bureau and the national guarantee fund.  In Ireland, the relevant Bureau is the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI).  These are important requirements as the MIBI is tasked with meeting the EU requirement of compensating victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  What this means therefore is that it is not possible to take out insurance with an insurer which is not operating in the Irish market as such companies will be members only of their own national bureau.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, an important point to note is that an insurer in considering whether it wants to take on Irish risk business will look at a wide range of factors including the award levels, the legal system, the general claims culture etc.  Therefore ultimately, even if we do get a more efficient and accessible EU insurance market, there can be no guarantees that insurers in other jurisdictions will automatically be willing to take on Irish risk.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the key to addressing this problem is to make Ireland more attractive to new entrants. In this regard, I believe the implementation of the second Personal Injuries Commission Report is an important part of this process in particular its main recommendation that this country follows the example of judicial intervention which has occurred in Northern Ireland and in the UK, namely the introduction of Judicial Guidelines for personal injury awards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500051#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Sector","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500051#WRB01500"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[44141\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500051#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the study being carried out by a company (details supplied) into pay across the financial sector; his views on performance related salaries in banks and other financial institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>Deputies will be aware that Government policy on banking remuneration has remained unchanged since the financial crisis.

These affect c.23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The Policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks. <\/p>  <p>  A new regulatory framework has been put in place since the financial crisis across the EU, the economy has returned to near full employment, the remaining banks are profitable again &ndash; and in the case of AIB and BOI sustainably so. The State remains the largest shareholder in AIB, BOI &amp;amp; PTSB but following the successful IPO of AIB in June 2017 all three banks are also now on an equal footing with listings on the main market of the Irish and London stock exchanges. This provides a platform for the State to recover its investment in the banks over time.<\/p>  <p>  The skill set required in the banking sector is evolving with the greatest demand for staff now in areas such as the digital economy, risk management, legal and compliance.

However, I am informed by the State Claims Agency that much of the preparatory work has been completed, and while it was originally hoped that a court date could be arranged for the end of October, at this stage it may slip into the first half of November.<\/p><p>The Agency has advised that the next tranche will comprise (a) newly settled claims requiring 100% payment, (b) all those cases where 65% was previously paid and where the balance of 35%  is due and (c) a number of third party legal costs payments. In total, it is expected that next tranche of claims will comprise in the region of 1,500 separate payments with a value of approximately &euro;21million.<\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to court procedures. The liquidator of Setanta estimates that the process of settling the vast majority of outstanding claims should be completed by end-2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500051#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":129,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 answered with Question No. 47.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500051#WRB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[44144\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500051#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies and employees that availed of the key employee engagement programme to date in 2018; the impact he expects to result from his proposed changes to the scheme in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[44495\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500051#WRB03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the changes he plans to make to increase the take-up by SMEs in the employment investment incentive scheme and the key employee engagement programme.","asker":"1229","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 101 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Key Employee Engagement Programme, KEEP, came into effect on 1 January this year to help SMEs to attract and retain employees in our highly competitive labour market.

Earlier this month, we supported the declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the situation in Nicaragua.<\/p>  <p>  The statement expresses the EU&rsquo;s serious concern at the situation, and urges the government of Nicaragua to allow the return of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR) to enable it to continue its mission, as well as calling on the government of Nicaragua to stop the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators, halt arrests based on laws which criminalise peaceful protest, allow free peaceful demonstrators and re-establish the full respect of due process for all detainees.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, call on the government of Nicaragua to act on the findings and recommendations of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) and UNOHCHR, to ensure full accountability for perpetrators of human rights abuses and the disarming and disbanding of armed groups.<\/p>  <p>  I support the EU call on the government of Nicaragua to resume the national dialogue.

In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for September 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 21.5% since peaking in July 2016.\u00a0 I appreciate that these figures represent a broad average; however, we have to recognise that these are the same figures that showed the large increase that many commentators regularly reference.\u00a0 Therefore, I am satisfied that the overall trend currently is downward, which is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  The above said, I am aware that some policyholders, like younger drivers, may not be seeing reductions in their insurance premiums, and may indeed have difficulty obtaining cover at a reasonable price.\u00a0 Unfortunately, younger drivers have historically tended to face higher premiums as they are seen by insurers as a category which poses a higher risk.\u00a0 In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will also use a combination of rating factors, which include the age and type of the vehicle, as well as the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.\u00a0 My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market. \u00a0In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to the age of the driver, and the relevant experience they may have, different insurance companies will price the risk differently.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am hopeful that with the continuing implementation of the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group there will be a further positive impact on pricing over the next 12 months or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500052#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500052#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[43863\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500052#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the report on tax expenditures of October 2018;

These arrangements will remain in place for tax years up to and including 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With effect from 1 January 2019 the administration of PAYE is undergoing significant change with the move to real-time reporting under the PAYE Modernisation programme. These changes will bring improved accuracy and transparency for all stakeholders, including employers, employees and Revenue, while also significantly streamlining the entire administration process. The streamlining will include the abolition of the current employer reporting obligations via P30, P35, P45, P46 and P60 forms.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As a result, employers will no longer be required to provide their employees with a P60 from the 2019 tax year onwards. Instead, Revenue will make an automatic End of Year Statement available to all employees. The first End of Year Statement will be available in early 2020 (in respect of the 2019 tax year) and will detail the employee&rsquo;s pay and deductions based on employer submissions for the year. This will include salary, any taxable Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments and any other income returned by the person, as well as applicable tax credits and reliefs. The End of Year Statement will be available online through the PAYE Services\/MyAccount service in the same manner as the current system. In circumstances where a person is unable to access Revenue&rsquo;s online services for whatever reason they will be able to request a paper copy of their End of Year Statement by contacting Revenue directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500053#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicle Grants","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500053#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[44331\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500053#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the &euro;50,000 cap on the original market value of a vehicle in the context of the 0% benefit-in-kind,BIK, rate for electric vehicles will apply to directors that were provided with an electric car during 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>I extended the benefit-in-kind exemption for electric vehicles until 31 December 2021 to support policies to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector.

Furthermore, the provision of such services requires on-going investment, volume pricing and access to technical expertise which given typical credit union size is likely to require a shared service model.<\/p>  <p>  The suggested limit of &euro;75 million may be re-examined once the framework is established and operational, at which stage, smaller credit unions will have greater clarity regarding cost, experience and operational considerations necessary for informed decision making on participation. <\/p>  <p>  Details and applications forms are available on the Central Bank website. www.centralbank.ie\/docs\/default-source\/Regulation\/industry-market-sectors\/credit-unions\/applying-for-approvals\/mpcas-application-form.pdf.

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.\u00a0 This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country\u00a0in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined.\u00a0 It is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.

Across the programme phases, Enterprise Ireland has committed approximately &euro;510 million, which, using a co-investment model, has raised a total of &euro;1.19 billion in seed and venture capital funding since 1994.  All funds are independently managed by private sector fund managers who make the decisions regarding investments. <\/p><p>The SVC programme operates by allocating funding to Enterprise Ireland to support the venture capital sector. EI then issues calls for applications for funding from venture capital funds across the programme period. Funds which are successful in obtaining investment from EI are then required to raise the additional funding required to operate their fund from private capital sources or other public sources of capital. EI&rsquo;s contribution to any single fund is capped at 50%. The funds supported by the SVC programme make their investment decisions on a commercial basis. EI invests on a pari-passu basis, meaning the EI&rsquo;s investments are on the same terms as private investors in the fund.

In 2017, data from the CSO showed that while 66% of Irish enterprises in the Wholesale and Retail Sector reported having a website or homepage, only 28% were able to facilitate online ordering.

The new pilot Online Retail Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland for my Department, is a result of the work of the Forum's Working Group on the Digital Economy. My Department has worked closely with the Forum over the past two years to develop this scheme in line with the needs of the sector. <\/p>  <p>  The pilot Scheme was launched in September with a fund of up to &euro;625,000, which was later doubled to &euro;1.25m as part of Budget 2019.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report 2018, published on 17 October 2018, ranks Ireland as the 23rd most competitive economy out of 140 countries. Ireland maintains its global competitiveness position from last year and continues to be the 8th most competitive economy in the Euro area and the 11th most competitive economy in the European Union. The World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business report currently ranks Ireland as the 17th most competitive out of 190 economies. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that a real indication of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is our ongoing strong employment growth across sectors and regions. In this regard, the impressive performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended. The IDA has also\u00a0made significant progress in diversifying their portfolio of client companies that invest here.\u00a0There were, for example, 111 new name investments in 2017, an increase of 12% compared to 2016 which saw 99 new name investments.

The report is available on the Department of Health website. The report sets out how personalised budgets could work as a funding mechanism for people with a disability, providing them with greater choice and control over the services and supports they receive. <\/p>  <p>  The Task Force, having reviewed the national and international research evidence and consulted with service users and their families, recommended that the Department of Health and the HSE should establish demonstration projects to test the delivery of personalised budgets with a view to identifying the best approach to the wider roll-out of these payment models following the initial demonstration phase.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Health has given his full support to the Report&rsquo;s recommendations and the Government has approved the development of these demonstration projects to test the models identified in the Report of the Taskforce, as outlined in the Task Force recommendation. Work has already begun on a number of actions and funding of &euro;1.3 million has been secured from the Department of Health budget for the set up and administration costs of demonstration projects.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health, NDA and the HSE are in the process of designing demonstration projects, as recommended by the Task Force on Personalised Budgets. Selection criteria for inclusion in the demonstration projects have not yet been finalised. The Department&rsquo;s website will be kept updated with information on the roll out of the demonstration projects as it becomes available. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of personalised budgets represents a fundamental shift in the delivery of services for people with disabilities and presents very significant operational and procedural challenges to the HSE and service providers as it has done in other jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  In light of these challenges, the Task Force has, from the outset, narrowed its focus to HSE funded disability services for adults with the intention that learnings from this cohort can inform the future roll-out of personalised budgets. The Task Force Report highlights the breadth of issues to be addressed in the initial demonstration sites and the substantial preparatory work needed. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the preferred option is to continue with demonstration projects focussed on adult services in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500061#WRM07800","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Data","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500061#WRM07900"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[44238\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500061#WRM08000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated full year cost of providing 2,000 extra homecare packages;

I'm advised that the HSE is also engaging with the post-graduate training bodies and other relevant bodies in relation to ensuring that its open disclosure policy is revised in line with the recommendations of the Scally Report.<\/p>  <p>  The Independent Clinical Expert Panel Review which is being led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) is examining the results of screening tests of all women who have developed cervical cancer who participated in the screening programme since it was established. This review will provide independent clinical assurance to women about the timing of their diagnosis, and any issues relating to their treatment and outcome. In light of the particular sensitivities surrounding this issue, it was decided that written, informed consent will be sought from women or the next-of-kin of women who have passed away before they are included in the review. The process of seeking consent from women for their inclusion in the review is ongoing. Almost 1,600 letters have now issued; approximately 813 consent forms are reported to have been returned up to end of last week, with 97% of women who have responded agreeing to take part in the review.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that a review of this complexity will take a number of months to complete.

It is very important to say that Dr Scally confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced.\u00a0 I am happy to say that Heads of Agreement have been signed with the contracted labs to extend their contracts pending the introduction of HPV testing as the primary screening test. This allows for the continuation of the service without interruption.

The overall objective of the report is closely aligned with the actions for the tillage sector contained in Foodwise 2025, which is the blueprint for the development of the agri-food sector overall. As part of that Dail discussion I outlined a range of ongoing measures and initiatives that my Department provides in support of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The crop evaluation and certification programmes run by my Department are designed specifically for Irish conditions to improve productivity and competitiveness in the sector. Average yields of control varieties in the cereal Recommended List trials have increased by 27% over the last 21 years. These programmes provide essential information for the brewing and distilling sector as well as assessments on milling and agronomic traits. <\/p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II covers specific areas of investment including Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Fertiliser Spreaders and increasing Grain Storage and Drying capacity.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to TAMS, the GLAS tiered entry system prioritised tillage farmers who chose the &ldquo;minimum tillage&rdquo; or &ldquo;catch crop establishment&rdquo; environmental actions.  Furthermore in order to assist tillage farmers, and in particular specialist malting barley growers, my department decided to grant a special exemption from the Basic Payment Scheme &ldquo;three crop rule&rdquo; to farmers that entered GLAS and committed to establish a catch crop on all of their tillage area.<\/p>  <p>  Like other EU member states Ireland is deficient in protein production and imports a significant portion of its requirements each year.  In this context I was pleased to be able to announce earlier this year the extension to the Protein Aid Scheme for 2018 with the same level of funding as 2017. <\/p>  <p>  I have long believed that the elimination of fertiliser tariffs and anti-dumping duties would help farmers, including tillage farmers, reduce their input costs and have actively pursued this at EU level. The EU Commission undertook to complete an interim review of anti-dumping measures in relation to fertilisers in 2018 and my officials are now examining the initial outcome of this review. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017 to support wider access to low cost finance, I extended the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme to specifically include the tillage and horticulture sectors through the provision of national funds. In further support Budget 2018 provided for a Future Growth Loan Scheme, which will be rolled out in early 2019. The scheme will provide up to &euro;120 million in long term, unsecured investment finance for farmers and small scale companies in the food and seafood sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, a key issue that will impact on the development of the agri-food sector, including tillage, in the future will be the outcome of negotiations on the CAP post 2020. I am committed to ensuring that the policy is adequately financed and measures are supportive of Irish agriculture.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500068#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Market Access","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500068#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":833,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[44518\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500068#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress on acquiring sheep and beef meat access to China.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":834,"content":"<p>The opening earlier this year of the Chinese beef market is the result of years of cooperation and hard work on the part of my Department, the Irish Embassy in Beijing, Bord Bia, and the Irish beef industry.

I asked the Task Force to oversee and report on this initial action, as well as, among other things, reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland.<\/p><p>The work of the Task Force has now been completed and it provided me with a full report in May 2018, titled &ldquo;Fire Safety in Ireland: Report of the Fire Safety Task Force&rdquo;, which describes its work, its conclusions on the state of fire safety in Ireland and its recommendations for moving forward.  I have accepted the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations, and I brought its report to Government on 6 June 2018. <\/p><p>Fire authorities were asked to identify medium to high-rise buildings in their functional areas of more than six storeys, or more than 18 metres in height.  My Department issued guidance in December 2017 dealing with fire safety assessment of medium-to-high rise buildings with cladding systems, including guidance on fire safety measures to be applied in buildings, pending completion of remedial works to cladding systems, where these are considered necessary.  In cases where the buildings identified are fitted with external cladding systems, fire authorities were asked to consider if the use of powers under section 18(6) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 &ndash; to require the person having control over the building to carry out a fire safety assessment of the premises and provide the assessment to the fire authority &ndash; was warranted. <\/p><p>This assessment and follow-up work is on-going and most recent figures provided by fire authorities indicate:  <\/p><p>- 838 buildings have been identified, countrywide, at this height,  <\/p><p>- 287 of these buildings are fitted with cladding systems, <\/p><p>- fire authorities required fire safety assessments in 219 cases &ndash; 102 in residential buildings and 117 in non-residential buildings,  <\/p><p>- 138 fire safety assessments have been received by fire authorities; work to complete and report the fire safety assessments in the remaining 81 buildings is underway; from their knowledge, fire services have not determined that any of the remaining buildings merit ceasing of  use\/ occupation of the buildings in question.<\/p><p>- fire authorities are proposing further action in respect of fire safety in 35 buildings where fire safety concerns &ndash; not in all cases related to external cladding &ndash;  have been identified.  <\/p><p>This fire safety and follow-up assessment work is on-going, and is being overseen by fire authorities, who are reporting on progress to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department. <\/p><p>By identifying a small number of buildings, so far, where remedial works were required, the review process undertaken is seen to have had a positive effect and to have made contributions to both enhancing fire safety in medium-to-high rise buildings, and also raising fire safety awareness among owners\/ landlords with statutory fire safety responsibilities.  <\/p><p>However, the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower highlights the critical importance of fire safety in buildings, and the need for sustained vigilance in this regard. In addition to the review described above, the Task Force report makes a range of recommendations for improvements to fire safety in buildings, and to provision of fire services in Ireland and I have requested the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management to carry through the recommendations of the report within my direct ambit and to oversee and report on the implementation of other recommendations.<\/p><p>Copies of both the Report and the Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:<\/p><p>Fire Safety Task Force Report:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500072#WRX03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Eligibility","counter":1006,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500072#WRX03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1007,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[44272\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500072#WRX03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the review of income eligibility limits for social housing will be published; when the limits will be increased; if his attention has been drawn to the particular difficulties in areas such as in counties Cavan and Monaghan in which income limits are low; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1008,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017.  Planning authorities must issue notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 November this year in respect of vacant sites included on their respective registers on 1 January 2018, indicating that the levy will apply to those sites on 1 January 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  While all 31 local authorities have established vacant site registers, not all registers have been populated to date as some local authorities are undertaking the necessary preparatory work in this regard, i.e. identifying qualifying vacant sites, their registered owners and commissioning the market valuations of such sites.  As required under the Act, the planning authority must enter certain information on the register in relation to a vacant site, including name and address of owner, the folio reference, as appropriate, the market value together with the date of entry on the register.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their own functional area.  As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, there are collectively almost 270 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 150 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy in order to ensure a consistent application of the levy provisions across all city and county areas and to facilitate the sharing of best practice.  My Department has provided guidance and advice and also organised three separate information seminars for local authorities, the most recent of which, in May 2018, was attended by officials from every local authority.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.  To support this work, my Department issued Circular PL 06\/2018 on 3 October 2018. Part 3 of this Circular requested a progress report on implementation of the vacant site levy to be completed by the Director of Planning in each Local Authority and returned to the Department by 31 October 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500073#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":1023,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500073#WRY01112"},{"type":"question","counter":1024,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[44458\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102500073#WRY01125","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 180 of 11 October 2018, the minimum energy rating a boiler must hold for it to be allowed to be installed in new homes here or as a replacement in existing homes..
