Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2457 is correspondence from Mr. Bernard Gloster, chief executive of Tusla, providing an information note requested by the committee in respect of contracts that were non-compliant with procurement guidelines.  People will have observed the committee in recent months being strong in respect of such cases.  Where there have been annual reports or financial statements suggesting non-compliance with procurement guidelines, we seek detailed explanations of why that happens.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General deals with such matters as part of his audit whenever he conducts one, the Committee of Public Accounts henceforth intends to bring such matters very much into the public forum.  Any time anything relating to non-compliance with Government procurement guidelines comes across our desk, we will write to the organisation seeking a detailed explanation and the measures in place to remedy the issue.  Otherwise, it may continue.  We highlighted some extraordinary issues in Tusla's 2018 accounts.  The agency stated it would review the matter in 2019, but it is near the end of 2019 and still it states the accounts will be reviewed.  Almost a year, therefore, after the end of 2018, it has not dealt with the issue.  We might highlight some of the main issues.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, Tusla's response is good, comprehensive and gives great detail on everything over the relevant figure where there was non-compliance with Government procurement guidelines.  It has given a breakdown by contractor under each heading.  It is a proper response.

There is something the Committee of Public Accounts can say on that issue, I think, in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#C01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>It has all been said in that regard.  There is another aspect to this and, as a committee member, I certainly need more information on procurement.  I agree we have highlighted that non-compliance is unacceptable.  However, on the ground, the ETBs talk about the difficulties the current system is creating for a sustainable supply of services that helps the local communities, which is the other part of it.  I would love some discussion around that.  Our role is to highlight and stop this but it is also to ask other questions.  With procurement done at national level, is there a built-in review of whether this is the best way and whether it is providing value for money and helping local communities?  Particularly in respect of the ETBs and the hospitals, I see a whole load of major cleaning companies and translation services for which the contracts are just rolled over repeatedly.  What about local businesses?  Is it geared to help them?  That is where I am at really.

We will include in the invitation that we want them to go through the 42 Government Department Votes that are put through the Oireachtas.  The Comptroller and Auditor General glanced through them this morning.  Some Departments and Votes of the Oireachtas have non-compliance with Government procurement.

I want it to summarise the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of every incident.

That is noted and published.<\/p> <p>  No. 2461 is from Julie Sinnamon of Enterprise Ireland, responding to our request for an information note regarding the loan write-off to the value of &euro;7.7 million.  It is a very detailed and comprehensive letter.  To summarise it, Enterprise Ireland gave a loan to an organisation, Nadcorp, in 1986.  The arrangement was that for several years simple interest would be charged.  It was agreed with the other investors that the loans to the organisation would, after a number of years, then commence to attract a 10% compound interest rate, which would continue to accrue.  Enterprise Ireland says that as the financial position of the company never facilitated it being in a position to pay this, the repayments continued to mount up.<\/p><p>It states that this was a technical inclusion in the loan agreement and that is why it was recorded in the financial accounts of the company each year.  A proposal was made to sell the company and Enterprise Ireland and the other shareholder sold their share in it.  The other investor and Enterprise Ireland wrote off the accumulated interest.  They were paid simple interest for the earlier years of the loan but the interest accumulated when the interest rate was more severe in the latter years was never collected.  The company was not in a financial position to pay the money.  When the shares were sold Enterprise Ireland had to write off &euro;7.7 million of what it describes as technically accrued interest that may have been payable at a future date, even though this was in the contract.  I also note that Enterprise Ireland states that the other investor wrote off a figure of &euro;10.3 million in compound interest as part of the same transaction.  Enterprise Ireland has explained the matter fully so we will note and publish the correspondence. <\/p><p> No. 2462 is correspondence from Mr. Gerard Dollard, CEO, Bord na gCon, providing information on the number of employees who leased cars as part of their terms and conditions of employment.  The number was six.  I asked questions about travel expenses and somebody asked about the number of leased cars.  The information is a small follow-up reply.  A considerable amount of travel is done by staff in Bord na gCon.  Senior staff must physically attend all of the race meetings for a variety of governance reasons.  I suggest members read the previous correspondence we discussed last week which provides a complete breakdown of a range of travel expenses, the vast majority of which was for under &euro;5,000 per individual.  The breakdown seemed fairly comprehensive.  We did not raise the issue of leased cars at an earlier meeting but it was raised at our last meeting.  Today's correspondence clarifies that six cars were leased.  We can note the correspondence and if members want to follow up the matter, they can do so.  The correspondence clarifies a minor point.  We note and publish that. <\/p><p> No. 2463 is correspondence from Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, director general, Central Statistics Office, requesting the committee's observations regarding the CSO's Statement of Strategy 2020-2030.  The secretariat of the committee will collate all responses if members wish to make an input into that.  I spoke to the secretariat yesterday and we are not obliged to make observations.  I am pleased that the CSO has sought our views.  As to what should be included, I have made a few suggestions.  If other members want to contact the secretariat, we can include their observations which the CSO might take into consideration when drawing up its strategic plan.  I noted a couple of issues.  The risk register for the national census will come up next year.  There may be categories of people, or areas, where compliance with the requirement to complete the form is not 100%.  That is a risk the CSO needs to assess and build into its national census.  Oversight is required for data collection by public bodies, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The CSO has been strong on this but maybe it needs to go further.  I also referred to the inclusion of approved housing bodies in relation to numbers on the State's balance sheet.  EUROSTAT has said the large ones should be included.  A broader issue for all of them now is the recording of bodies substantially funded from the public purse.  In other words, there are many organisations that work almost full-time for the HSE.  Should these be included in the figures the CSO collects?  I am only raising the issue.  <\/p><p> Another issue is the recording of contingent assets, which is not really done.  There are certain moneys that are due to the State.  For example, some employers owe money in respect of the redundancy scheme and this is only noted if it is received.  People in payment arrangements with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection arising from overpayments made in the past owe a large debt.  This is recorded when the payments are collected.  The CSO should have a system for recording the total debts or the total amount collectable in assets, rather than just recording those payments that it receives.<\/p><p> Those are my personal observations.  If anyone wants to include anything in the letter, he or she should contact the secretariat.  I thank the CSO for asking us for our views.  We note and publish that.

We have a similar letter, No. 2498, which is almost a similar document.  There is a different date on it.  It is not on the schedule.  We wrote to the SBCI concerning the statement in its accounts of the number of employees assisted by the loans it has extended.  We said that was not a real figure.  The SBCI actually gave us a figure of total employment in organisations to which it advanced some portion of a loan.  This letter states that the average loan is approximately &euro;49,000, which is quite small.  It has already extended &euro;1.24 billion in loans.  It includes great information, including a county-by-county breakdown of the number of loans and their value for each year from 2015 to 2019.  It is very good information in which members might be interested.<\/p><p> The SBCI accepts that all it knows is the number of employees in organisations that have been assisted: \"As this is the only data we collect pertaining to employment, we are unable to fulfil directly the committee's request for a breakdown of the number of jobs supported by the SBCI, as distinct from the number of jobs in companies which receive funding or support from SBCI.\"  The correspondence goes on to state: \"We will keep our data-gathering under review to ensure that we can continue to provide the Committee with high-quality information that can assist in its review of the SBCl.\"<\/p><p> The correspondence answers our questions.  The SBCI now acknowledges that the figures submitted were overall totals.  It does not have a mechanism to produce more granular data.  It would be better not to put these inflated public relations-friendly figures in the accounts to give the impression that the SBCI is helping thousands of people when it has no information at all on the actual number of people assisted by the loans it has granted.<\/p><p> No. 2498 is a slight correction of No. 2471.  They are essentially the same.  I have outlined the essence of the letter.  We have made our point.  We will take the same query up with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.

This letter states: \"it is difficult to make a direct link between an individual SME taking out an SBCI loan or leasing product and that same SME creating a specific new job or maintaining a specific job that would otherwise have been lost.\"<\/p> <p>  The Chairman spoke about a glossy figure.  The SBCI put out an earlier statement in a letter to us claiming to support 148,000 jobs, but under a bit of scrutiny that does not seem to be the case.  The SBCI cannot tell us how many jobs it has actually supported.  This raises a question about value for money.  Is the SBCI just supporting loans that would have been offered anyway?

We might point out that it produces figures that are not relevant to its lending.  We have made that point.  The SBCI does not have the information we seek.  I will ask its officials to improve data collection.  Perhaps the application forms submitted by companies receiving loans funded by the SBCI should include a question on the number of new jobs the loan is expected to support or the number of jobs that will be specifically retained as a result.

It is hugely insightful in the context of our understanding of the system, particularly at a time when revaluations are happening across the country, including in my constituency.  It helps us to understand the zoning method and how it is based on the principle that the most valuable part of the shop is that closest to the street or mall.  Zoning occurs from the shop front backwards and there are reductions to it as one goes along.  It is interesting that it states that zoning is a tool, an aid to valuation, which must at all times be overruled by common sense.  I hope that is adhered to.<\/p><p>The revenue derived from rates accounts for &euro;1.5 billion, or 33% of current local government income.  In some cases, it provides as much as 53% of total funding for individual local authorities.  The Comptroller and Auditor General tries to have a yearly analysis of the flow of income into local government.  Last year, the Minister for Finance, touching on Exchequer contributions to the Local Government Fund, said:<\/p><blockquote>Turning to Local Government, 2019 will see a contribution from the Department&rsquo;s Vote to the Local Government Fund of &euro;185 million &ndash; an increase of &euro;60 million on 2018.  This will provide significant additional support to the local government sector in providing a range of essential services at local level ... and resources for certain local government initiatives across the country.<\/blockquote> <p>Four weeks ago, suddenly the Local Government Fund was cut by nearly &euro;30 million without a dickie bird of a mention.  I tabled a parliamentary question to ascertain how something could be cut by &euro;30 million in one year.  The answer pertained, supposedly, to the fact that support for local government in 2020 had be realigned, largely as a result of the valuation of Irish Water as a global utility for commercial rates.  From 2014 to 2019, compensation was paid to local authorities in lieu of commercial rates from Irish Water and Irish Water is liable for commercial rates from 2020.  In the Department's reckoning, compensation in lieu of commercial rates ceases and the apportionment of the valuation of Irish Water among local authorities from 2020 will be based on population.  This is similar to other global utility companies with national networks.  It highlights the difficulty in analysing the flow of income into local government.  In the reply to the parliamentary question, the Department went on to say that it expected the local authority sector to collect a broadly similar amount, and maybe even a greater amount in some cases, through commercial rates as was received in previous years through Exchequer funding for water rates compensation.  It said it would monitor the financial impact of the transition for local authorities.  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General highlight or analyse the real impact of this major realignment?  Some &euro;30 million has gone out with the stroke of a pen but the Department states that it will come back in another way, but it goes to the heart of the issues with the funding of the local government sector, which particularly worries me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#G00200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571904000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I would consider that any allocation of funding is in the policy domain so I cannot really comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I am not asking for the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the rights and wrongs of the apportionment but on the financial impact on the sector, which he analyses.

The expenditure is divided into four expenditure programmes which correspond to the four key strategic objectives set out the Department's statement of strategy for 2016 to 2019.<\/p><p>The share of the expenditure under each programme is indicated in the figure now on screen.<\/p><p> Appropriations-in-aid of the Vote in 2018 amounted to &euro;472 million.  Receipts from the EU comprised the bulk of these receipts.  In addition, the Department is the accredited paying agency for EU payments amounting to just over &euro;1.2 billion for 2018, which are accounted for separately from the Vote.  Note 6.1 to the appropriation account gives an overview of all EU funding handled by the Department.<\/p><p> The Department provides substantial funding each year for a number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  The Department is also directly responsible for management of the State's six fishery harbour centres, and reports in separate financial statements on the operations of the harbours.<\/p><p> At the year's end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;200 million less than provided for in the Estimates for 2018.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;22 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2019.  This was similar to the level of carry-over from 2017 to 2018, which related to underexpenditure under the forestry and bioenergy subhead.  The remainder of the surplus on the Vote for 2018, amounting to just over &euro;178 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the year's end.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.  I did, however, draw attention of the statement of the Accounting Officer on internal financial control, which discloses non-competitive procurement by the Department of &euro;17.75 million worth of goods and services in 2018.  This included a significant level of procurement that the Accounting Officer acknowledges was not compliant with relevant public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue for the Department.<\/p><p> Turning to chapter 10, on forestry grants, one of the Department's functions is the development and implementation of national and EU schemes in support of forestry and forestry support services, as members will be aware.  In the period 2015 to 2018, the Department spent a total of &euro;404 million on forestry development.  Most of the expenditure is in the form of grants to landholders for tree planting and maintenance of forest plantations.<\/p><p> The Department's current forestry programme is focused primarily on increasing the level of forest cover and supporting private forest holders in actively managing their forests.  The Department's annual targets for land to be afforested were also included in the national mitigation plan of 2017 on the basis that afforestation can assist in sequestering carbon dioxide and in meeting greenhouse gas emissions targets.<\/p><p> Up to the end of 2018, there has been consistent underexpenditure by the Department on the forestry programme.  The shortfall in 2018 between the amount provided and the actual expenditure was &euro;11 million, or almost 11%.  The average underspend over the period 2015 to 2018 was 9%.  The Department has stated that the underspend is mainly due to the lower than anticipated take-up of planting grants by landholders.  The Department set a performance target of grant-assisted planting of just over 27,000 ha in the period 2015 to 2018.  Over that period, around 22,500 ha was afforested - a shortfall of around 17%.<\/p><p> As a condition of state aid approval from the EU for the forestry programme, the Department was also required to target a rate of 30% of the area afforested annually to be planted with broadleaf trees.  The Department structured the grant rates payable with the aim of encouraging this type of planting.  However, the average achieved for the period 2015 to 2017 was just 20% broadleaf.  This increased to 27% in 2018.  The Department attributes the increase to higher grant rates introduced in February 2018 following a mid-term review of the forestry programme.  That review was also a requirement under the state aid approval.  <\/p><p> The Department carried out a cost-benefit analysis of the forestry programme in 2014, prior to the roll-out of the programme.  The mid-term review did not revise or update the analysis, even though a number of values associated with the key assumptions used have changed since then.  In addition to the changes in the value of the grants, there have been changes in the valuation of EU carbon dioxide emissions.

I would like to refer to the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account for 2018, and chapter 10 of the report on the accounts of the public service 2018 on forestry grants.<br\/><br\/>I will begin with the appropriation account.  The Department&rsquo;s gross Estimate for 2018 was &euro;1.586 billion.  This included a carry-over of capital savings of &euro;23.8 million from 2017.  In all, this represented an overall increase of &euro;97 million over the corresponding figure for 2017.  The gross outturn was &euro;1.546 billion, an increase of &euro;158 million over 2017.  The Department received a technical Supplementary Estimate to further address emerging priorities.  This provided extra funding which was almost entirely offset by additional appropriations-in-aid and also facilitated the transfer of funds within the Vote.  I will refer to this in my later remarks.<br\/><br\/>The Department also receives appropriations-in-aid which are unusually prominent in 2018 in the overall financial outcome.  These principally comprise EU receipts in respect of rural development, seafood development and animal disease programmes.  In 2018, these receipts amounted to &euro;471.8 million, some &euro;160 million more than the estimate of &euro;312 million.  The difference was substantially because of the timing of two large payments from the EU in respect of its co-funding of rural development programme schemes.  One of these, amounting to approximately &euro;82 million, was expected in December 2017 but was not received until January 2018.  A second receipt, expected in January 2019, was received in December 2018. <br\/><br\/>Turning back to expenditure, the Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided into four programmes, each representing a key policy priority.  Programme A relates to the food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes that underpin our agrifood sector.  These include disease eradication programmes such as those relating to tuberculosis, TB, or transmissable spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, testing for residues in food products, on-farm controls, plant protection controls and other such headings.  Programme expenditure under this heading, excluding staff and administration costs, amounted to just under &euro;87 million in 2018.  There was a minimal saving of &euro;200,000 compared with the budgeted amount.  I will comment on staff costs here because such costs constitute almost half of the expenditure on this programme and this programme accounts for more than half of the Department&rsquo;s total payroll.  This reflects the very strong investment in the skills, expertise and commitment of our staff who are the foundation of our food safety regime upon which our agrifood sector is so dependent.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Programme B covers our major farm support schemes other than the basic payment scheme, which is entirely EU funded.  By and large, these schemes are intended to encourage sustainable agricultural practices and most of them, other than the forestry programme, receive co-funding from the EU under the rural development programme.  The final allocation for these schemes in 2018, following a Supplementary Estimate, came to just over &euro;849 million.  This included an additional &euro;23 million to agri-environmental schemes and &euro;7 million for fodder schemes operated within the &quot;other schemes&quot; subhead provided through the Supplementary Estimate.<br\/><br\/>As members will recall, a range of severe weather conditions impacted severely on grass growth and feed supply and increased input costs for many livestock producers.  To help alleviate this situation, the standard 75% advance payment on certain EU co-funded schemes was increased to 85% and special national funded schemes were put in place to help boost the supply of fodder.  In 2018, almost 50,000 people participated in our GLAS scheme, more than 24,000 participated in the beef data and genomics scheme, and the sheep welfare and knowledge transfer schemes were launched.  Other co-funded schemes included the areas of natural constraint scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, farm investment scheme and the organics scheme.  The forestry programme alone among these schemes is 100% nationally funded.<br\/><br\/>The eventual outturn for this programme was &euro;823 million.  This was more than &euro;97 million greater than the previous year and reflects the mature stage we have reached in the rural development programme which has helped to allow us make a large portion of scheme year payments within the same the calendar year.<br\/><br\/>On the capital side, the TAMS investment scheme saw a much improved drawdown, with &euro;66.8 million expended, which is double the 2017 figure and reflected good levels of investment in on farm facilities, despite the difficult year for many producers.  Unfortunately, expenditure on the forestry programme was lower than hoped in 2018 and this remains a continuing but critically important challenge.  I will comment further in my remarks on the specific chapter on forestry grants in<b><\/b>the<b><\/b>report on the accounts of the public service 2018.  The capital carry-over into 2019 from 2018 was largely drawn from the forestry savings in 2018.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Programme C, policy and strategy, includes expenditure on research and training on a number of food support schemes, as well as grants to some of our State agencies.  It also included a number additional measures designed to help build resilience in the sector confronted by Brexit.  The largest of these was the Brexit response loan scheme where a &euro;25 million contribution was made to a scheme jointly established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Supplementary Estimate was also availed of to transfer relatively small savings which emerged in various parts of the Vote to respond to a specific request from the World Food Programme for the earliest possible release of the first element of funding under our 2019-21 strategic partnership agreement.  This resulted in payments of &euro;19 million to the World Food Programme in 2018.  Overall, the programme C outturn of &euro;370 million was &euro;5 million less than the voted allocation.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Programme D<b><\/b>relates to the seafood sector.  Expenditure under the programme part of this heading in 2018 amounted to &euro;118 million, 11% ahead of 2017, and included some &euro;24.6 million in the upgrading and development of fisheries harbours.  Approximately 88% of fish landed in Ireland are landed into the six centres owned by the Department.<i><\/i>Programme D also includes &euro;8 million under the seafood development programme, and grants-in-aid to the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  This programme also funded expenditure of almost &euro;10 million on the substantive completion of work on the remediation of the east tip project on Haulbowline Island.<br\/><br\/>As has been mentioned already, the Comptroller and Auditor General recently concluded an examination of forestry grants, the results of which have formed the basis of a chapter in the report on the accounts of the public service for<i><\/i>2018<i>.<\/i>The examination focused on the background to the forestry programme and its objectives, the outturn and activity of the programme, forestry grants in place and their administration.  The value for money aspects of the forestry programme are particularly important given that it is entirely Exchequer funded.  The report made two main recommendations and my responses to those recommendations are included in the chapter.  In summary, I fully agree with both recommendations which relate to cost-benefit analysis, forestry targets and the impacts of changes to grant rates.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>I very much welcome this analysis by the Comptroller and Auditor General and found it to be an extremely useful exercise in reviewing our practices and procedures on the payments of forestry grants.  The programme also raises broader policy questions which will be considered in the design of the next forestry programme.<br\/><br\/>The mid-term review of the current forestry programme, which took place in 2018, introduced several changes, including increased grant and premium rates, with the highest increases reserved for broadleaf categories.  This has already resulted in an increase in the proportion of broadleaves planted, which reached 27% in the year following the changes, compared with 21% in 2017.<br\/><br\/>A cost-benefit analysis will be undertaken as part of the development of the new forestry programme 2021-27, which is in line with the public spending code.  Preparation for the new programme is commencing and is dependent on the EU timeline for finalising the CAP regulations and the new state aid rules.  All aspects of the current programme will be reviewed as part of the development of the new programme.  The overall aim of the programme is to increase the national afforestation rate, which is currently 11%, well below the EU average of 43%.  The climate action plan 2019 outlined the ambitious target of planting 8,000 ha of new afforestation each year.  The new programme, in tandem with the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan for Ireland, will be focused on how to deliver on the goals of the climate action plan in particular.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their attention and welcome any follow-up questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>The lead speaker for today's meeting is Deputy Bobby Aylward who has 20 minutes.

That is how the legislation is written.  We have had approaches from various bodies over recent years explaining that they have significant potential for economic development.  Many cases have merit but we are constrained by the funding we have.  It would be nice to be able to help everybody to the extent that they wish, but that is just not possible.<\/p> <p>  There was an effort to cohere Horse Sport Ireland's efforts into a strategic policy plan.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, organised a committee and the body established a strategic plan for the industry, Reaching New Heights.  As a condition for additional funding, the Department commissioned a report by Indecon to look at the structures in Horse Sport Ireland.  It is unusual, being a company limited by guarantee.  It was established in 2007 and is an amalgamation between the Equestrian Federation of Ireland and what was the Irish Horse Board.  It had 27 different affiliate bodies, all of which were on the board.  While that had strengths with its representative nature, it was not a good way to structure a board and develop a strategic plan.  Indecon wrote its report and the board has been restructured.  We still have representatives of all the affiliates in advisory sub-committees, but that work has been done.  The Department has increased the funding bit by bit, from &euro;2.5 million in 2018 to &euro;3 million in 2019, and it will be &euro;4 million in 2020.

One of the issues that occurs to me is that I think it was designed to get people who are over 55 out of the system.  Forgive me for thinking now that 55 is not as old as I used to think it was.  The demographic issue in farming is not about 55 year olds, without prejudice to the competence of such people, and I am heading in that direction myself.  The focus we put in the previous CAP was on encouraging young people.  We had a number of incentives for young people.  I accept there is great reluctance among older farmers to pass down their land and get out.  This is something we must reflect on in the next CAP.  In doing so we must also reflect on the outcome of our previous study, which showed we were paying people for something that might have happened anyway and it was not really that effective.<\/p> <p>  There was another issue, which is that once people reached the age of 66 the payment was subtracted from the old age pension.  There were all kinds of complexities with the old system that limited its effectiveness.  I accept it is an issue.

The fact is that most of it related to receipts that arrived in early or late.  What we are looking at with the &euro;200 million is the net figure.  What happened was that we were expecting an &euro;82 million receipt in respect of the rural development fund to arrive in 2017 and it arrived in 2018.  Equally, our assessment was that because of changes in EU legislation we would not get some of the rural development funding for 2018 until 2019 and we actually got it in 2018.  The bulk of it is made up of two very large receipts.  It is not that we spent &euro;200 million less than we had, it is that we got appropriations-in-aid to a significant amount of it.  The actual spending figure was &euro;40 million.  We spent &euro;40 million less than we had.  The reason for this is that when we have rural development schemes we make prudent provision for what might mature during the year but they are demand led and if the demand does not arise the money cannot be spent.<\/p><p>When we set up the TAMS scheme, which was previously the agricultural investment scheme, we made what was not the best decision, which was that once people had an approval, they had three years to deliver on the investment.

To give the Deputy some perspective, which does not absolve us from responsibility, we have approximately &euro;100 million worth of procurement in the Department, of which &euro;3.9 million is self-declared as non-compliant.  That is unacceptable.  We have done a lot of work to improve our procurement systems in recent years.  We have established a procurement office.  Every division has a procurement liaison officer so that when procurements are made, they can guide people and explain the rules to them.  There is an issue with the accumulation of contracts.  Non-compliant contracts remain on the list until they are excised, at which point we move on.  Overall, our level of non-compliant procurement is diminishing.  Our objective clearly is to get that down to zero.  We need to look at some of our systems.  I will give the Deputy an example of how this might happen, which again is not intended as an excuse but as an explanation of the administrative inadequacies that might lead to this happening.  If we have a dispersed laboratory service and it is buying laboratory disposables such as test tubes and so on, it is possible that people in different places could be procuring from the same company without sight the overall picture.  That is something we have to resolve.  A significant part of this &euro;3.9 million was in the laboratory service.

In 2018, in particular, we were considerably below target.  In other years improvements were made, but in 2018, the very year in which we were all coming under pressure on climate change, it was down.  I would have thought a mid-term review in February 2018 would have looked at climate change and many other variables.  What was done with broadleaves was welcome.  Why was the mid-term review so specific and restricted?  Why has no cost benefit analysis been made since?  I understand the Department had to do it before it and that is good, but it has not been done since.  Mr. Gleeson is talking about doing it in the future.  I do not know whether the best terminology to use is a cost benefit analysis, a review or a post-project review.  However, nothing was done, except a limited mid-term review with very restricted criteria.<\/p><p> The forestry programme lists ten criteria.  There are 11 measures listed on page 147 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The forestry programme focuses on two.  Measures 1 and 3 accounted for 95% of the spend in 2018, the very year in which the level of planting was down.  That means that nine other measures were not getting a look in.  Interestingly, the ones that got in were the construction of forest roads to allow access and native woodlands, on which progress was made, which I welcome.  However, some of the other measures are very good, including close-to-home woodlands, I imagine in city and rural areas and so on.  I would have thought a review would have looked at all of these to see why they were not being pushed because, presumably, they were equally as important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#T09000","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571904000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I am not sure at what page of the report the Deputy is looking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>It is page 147 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the chapter on measures included in the forestry programme for the period 2014 to 2020.

There is an argument that the only way to reduce emissions is to cull the herd but there are tiny farmers with five or six head of cattle - usually bad, old cows that nobody else wants - as a hobby, although I mean them no disrespect.  The issue is that many small farmers have inefficient animals, which might be infertile or might not produce good milk, and they contribute to the overall negative picture.  As Mr. Gleeson noted, however, we must breed and feed correctly, and get as many calves as possible from each cow before returning them to production and sending the calves and milk to wherever.

My children tell me that they should not have palm oil.  I do not even know if we have palm oil in the house.  I tell them that eating steak is good for them.  There is a narrative that quinoa and soy that come all the way across the world are better for us.  I do not see the message about the protein of high biological value in our meat.

I understand the pricing when it comes to euro, but let us talk about the product first because it is about the product and the price can vary between sterling, euro and everything else.  The value of what we sold to the UK last year was &euro;5.5 billion but the value of what we imported was &euro;4.5 billion.  That is not a major difference.

When one looks at those charts, they look kind of similar but the right hand figures have been shrunk to make them look different.

We have to go through it to see the amount on the right-hand side, where the gaps are different.  That is one of the issues I wanted to raise.

We knew we were importing quite an amount of food, because we see it on our supermarket shelves, but I thought we were exporting more than double of what we were importing.  It now transpires that it is the other way around.  We will come to the price and the monetary value in due course.<\/p><p> I refer to prepared consumer foods.  The Department's chart states that the prepared consumer foods sector, which is obviously the convenience-type foods many people want, accounted for more than &euro;2.6 billion in agrifood sector exports in 2018, and &euro;3.6 billion in imports.  Ireland is importing far more prepared consumer foods for consumption than we are exporting.

Ireland was exporting more foodstuffs than it was importing ten years ago.  This is the myth we have all lived on.  In the last ten year - this has nothing to do with Brexit - the level of imports of foodstuffs has increased at a much higher rate.  In fact, it has more than doubled in the last decade.  The product, not the price, of our exports has only gone from approximately 4 million tonnes to 7 million tonnes, an increase of 3 million tonnes, whereas our imports have gone from 6 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes.  The public is not aware that in the last decade, Ireland has changed in respect of how it deals with food and in the last decade - this has nothing to do with Brexit - we have far surpassed our food consumption in terms of  imports as opposed to what we export.

It is possible that the animals we saw on that television programme were formerly involved in the greyhound racing industry, although they may not have been.  I do not know.  I am not sure.  The point I am making is that many things are happening in the canine industry that are not connected to racing greyhounds.  That is a subset.  This is about animal welfare.  People are as concerned about puppies, little terriers, or nice labradors being mistreated as about greyhounds being mistreated.  We have concentrated on greyhounds because there is a State body involved in the area at which we and the public can have a go.  The Irish Coursing Club, ICC, however, is a private organisation and gets no funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In following this issue in recent meetings, I have been mystified as to why a private organisation is stitched into national legislation.  It is a policy matter but, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would say that, if we are interested in animal welfare, it makes no sense that a private charity with no public accountability can be responsible for registration in the canine industry, of which the Irish Greyhound Board is only a subset.

Acceptance of the amendment involves accordingly the deletion of section 2 of the Bill.  This approach to the amendment of section 2 was taken on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in view of the number and nature of the changes made to the section.<\/p><p>The great majority of the proposed amendments concern the form and not the substance of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  None of the individual amendments lessen or weaken in any way the protections contained in the Bill as initiated.  The amendments in fact significantly strengthen the protections provided for in the Bill.  As I have submitted a detailed briefing note to the select committee setting out the individual amendments made to section 2 and the reasons for them, I will now outline only the main amendments that are proposed.<\/p><p>There are three substantive additions to the Bill.  The first is the proposed prohibition in section 66B(7), as proposed in section 2, on contract terms that place a limit on the number of gift vouchers that can be used in a single transaction.  Where such a contract term applies, a consumer with two &euro;100 vouchers who wishes to purchase goods or services for &euro;200 from the business that issued the voucher would be permitted to use only one of the vouchers.  A contract term of this kind is unfair and unjustified.<\/p><p>The second addition provides in section 66B(8), as proposed in section 2, that where a gift voucher contract provides for the replacement of a lost or stolen voucher, the replacement voucher should have the same expiry date as the original voucher.  This provision will protect consumers by ensuring that an original and a replacement gift voucher will be subject to a combined expiry period of not less than five years, while clarifying for businesses that a replacement voucher will not be treated as a new voucher for the purpose of the five-year expiry date requirement.<\/p><p>The third substantive addition provides in section 66B(10), as proposed in section 2, for an exception to the doctrine of privity of contract, which restricts rights and obligations under a contract to the parties to the contract.  As gift vouchers of their nature are normally redeemed by their recipients rather than their purchasers, it is necessary to ensure that the recipient of a voucher can exercise the same rights under the contract as its purchaser, including rights included in gift voucher contracts by this Bill.<\/p><p>A number of the proposed amendments have been made in response to legal advice that certain provisions of the Bill as initiated were at risk of legal challenge on the ground of incompatibility with the unfair commercial practices directive.  The legal advice recommended that in order to minimise the risk of legal challenge, provisions aimed at commercial practices by traders should be redrafted so that they were aimed instead at terms in gift voucher contracts.  This has been done in sections 66B(1), (4), (6) and (8), as proposed in section 2 of the Bill.<\/p><p>The great majority of the other amendments to the Bill are technical in nature.  The definition of \"gift voucher\" in section 66A(1), as proposed in section 2, has been amended to exclude a number of products such as prepaid telephone and Internet cards, gas and electricity cards, diesel and petrol cards, cheques and postal orders that share some characteristics with gift vouchers and might accordingly be held to come within the definition of that term, but to which the protections of the Bill are unnecessary or would be inappropriate.  Electronic money gift vouchers are also excluded from the scope of the Bill in response to legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General that its inclusion risked incompatibility with the maximum harmonisation nature of the electronic money directive, as well as conflict with the regulatory regime for electronic money.  The counterparty to the trader who supplies a gift voucher under a gift voucher contract is now referred to as a \"person\" rather than, as in the Bill as initiated, a \"consumer\", in recognition of the facts that many businesses purchase vouchers to give to their employees and that these employees would not be regarded as \"consumers\" under the definition of that term in consumer legislation.<\/p><p>Other technical amendments seek to clarify aspects of the application of the provisions to which they relate in order to avoid legal uncertainty and unintended consequences.  In section 66A(2)(a), as proposed in section 2, for example, the exclusion from the definition of \"gift voucher\" of vouchers redeemable for the purchase at a discounted price of specified goods or services for a period of limited duration now provides that this period should not exceed three months.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571871600,"counter":743,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571871600,"counter":744,"content":"<p>Section 2 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571871600,"counter":745,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following: <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;<b>Consequential amendments to Act of 2007<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>3. <\/b>The Act of 2007 is amended&mdash;<blockquote>(a) in section 67, by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (d):<blockquote><blockquote>&lsquo;(d) any contravention of section 65(1) or section 66B,&rsquo;,<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>(b) in section 85(1), by the substitution of the following paragraphs for paragraph (d):<blockquote><blockquote>&lsquo;(d) Regulation 5(3), 7(8), 8(5), 9(4), 10(10), 11(6), 12(5), 19(7), 25(4), 26(5) or 27(4) of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I.
