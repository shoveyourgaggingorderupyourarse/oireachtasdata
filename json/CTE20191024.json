Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2457 is correspondence from Mr. Bernard Gloster, chief executive of Tusla, providing an information note requested by the committee in respect of contracts that were non-compliant with procurement guidelines.  People will have observed the committee in recent months being strong in respect of such cases.  Where there have been annual reports or financial statements suggesting non-compliance with procurement guidelines, we seek detailed explanations of why that happens.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General deals with such matters as part of his audit whenever he conducts one, the Committee of Public Accounts henceforth intends to bring such matters very much into the public forum.  Any time anything relating to non-compliance with Government procurement guidelines comes across our desk, we will write to the organisation seeking a detailed explanation and the measures in place to remedy the issue.  Otherwise, it may continue.  We highlighted some extraordinary issues in Tusla's 2018 accounts.  The agency stated it would review the matter in 2019, but it is near the end of 2019 and still it states the accounts will be reviewed.  Almost a year, therefore, after the end of 2018, it has not dealt with the issue.  We might highlight some of the main issues.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, Tusla's response is good, comprehensive and gives great detail on everything over the relevant figure where there was non-compliance with Government procurement guidelines.  It has given a breakdown by contractor under each heading.  It is a proper response.

There is something the Committee of Public Accounts can say on that issue, I think, in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#C01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>It has all been said in that regard.  There is another aspect to this and, as a committee member, I certainly need more information on procurement.  I agree we have highlighted that non-compliance is unacceptable.  However, on the ground, the ETBs talk about the difficulties the current system is creating for a sustainable supply of services that helps the local communities, which is the other part of it.  I would love some discussion around that.  Our role is to highlight and stop this but it is also to ask other questions.  With procurement done at national level, is there a built-in review of whether this is the best way and whether it is providing value for money and helping local communities?  Particularly in respect of the ETBs and the hospitals, I see a whole load of major cleaning companies and translation services for which the contracts are just rolled over repeatedly.  What about local businesses?  Is it geared to help them?  That is where I am at really.

We will include in the invitation that we want them to go through the 42 Government Department Votes that are put through the Oireachtas.  The Comptroller and Auditor General glanced through them this morning.  Some Departments and Votes of the Oireachtas have non-compliance with Government procurement.

I want it to summarise the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of every incident.

That is noted and published.<\/p> <p>  No. 2461 is from Julie Sinnamon of Enterprise Ireland, responding to our request for an information note regarding the loan write-off to the value of &euro;7.7 million.  It is a very detailed and comprehensive letter.  To summarise it, Enterprise Ireland gave a loan to an organisation, Nadcorp, in 1986.  The arrangement was that for several years simple interest would be charged.  It was agreed with the other investors that the loans to the organisation would, after a number of years, then commence to attract a 10% compound interest rate, which would continue to accrue.  Enterprise Ireland says that as the financial position of the company never facilitated it being in a position to pay this, the repayments continued to mount up.<\/p><p>It states that this was a technical inclusion in the loan agreement and that is why it was recorded in the financial accounts of the company each year.  A proposal was made to sell the company and Enterprise Ireland and the other shareholder sold their share in it.  The other investor and Enterprise Ireland wrote off the accumulated interest.  They were paid simple interest for the earlier years of the loan but the interest accumulated when the interest rate was more severe in the latter years was never collected.  The company was not in a financial position to pay the money.  When the shares were sold Enterprise Ireland had to write off &euro;7.7 million of what it describes as technically accrued interest that may have been payable at a future date, even though this was in the contract.  I also note that Enterprise Ireland states that the other investor wrote off a figure of &euro;10.3 million in compound interest as part of the same transaction.  Enterprise Ireland has explained the matter fully so we will note and publish the correspondence. <\/p><p> No. 2462 is correspondence from Mr. Gerard Dollard, CEO, Bord na gCon, providing information on the number of employees who leased cars as part of their terms and conditions of employment.  The number was six.  I asked questions about travel expenses and somebody asked about the number of leased cars.  The information is a small follow-up reply.  A considerable amount of travel is done by staff in Bord na gCon.  Senior staff must physically attend all of the race meetings for a variety of governance reasons.  I suggest members read the previous correspondence we discussed last week which provides a complete breakdown of a range of travel expenses, the vast majority of which was for under &euro;5,000 per individual.  The breakdown seemed fairly comprehensive.  We did not raise the issue of leased cars at an earlier meeting but it was raised at our last meeting.  Today's correspondence clarifies that six cars were leased.  We can note the correspondence and if members want to follow up the matter, they can do so.  The correspondence clarifies a minor point.  We note and publish that. <\/p><p> No. 2463 is correspondence from Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, director general, Central Statistics Office, requesting the committee's observations regarding the CSO's Statement of Strategy 2020-2030.  The secretariat of the committee will collate all responses if members wish to make an input into that.  I spoke to the secretariat yesterday and we are not obliged to make observations.  I am pleased that the CSO has sought our views.  As to what should be included, I have made a few suggestions.  If other members want to contact the secretariat, we can include their observations which the CSO might take into consideration when drawing up its strategic plan.  I noted a couple of issues.  The risk register for the national census will come up next year.  There may be categories of people, or areas, where compliance with the requirement to complete the form is not 100%.  That is a risk the CSO needs to assess and build into its national census.  Oversight is required for data collection by public bodies, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The CSO has been strong on this but maybe it needs to go further.  I also referred to the inclusion of approved housing bodies in relation to numbers on the State's balance sheet.  EUROSTAT has said the large ones should be included.  A broader issue for all of them now is the recording of bodies substantially funded from the public purse.  In other words, there are many organisations that work almost full-time for the HSE.  Should these be included in the figures the CSO collects?  I am only raising the issue.  <\/p><p> Another issue is the recording of contingent assets, which is not really done.  There are certain moneys that are due to the State.  For example, some employers owe money in respect of the redundancy scheme and this is only noted if it is received.  People in payment arrangements with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection arising from overpayments made in the past owe a large debt.  This is recorded when the payments are collected.  The CSO should have a system for recording the total debts or the total amount collectable in assets, rather than just recording those payments that it receives.<\/p><p> Those are my personal observations.  If anyone wants to include anything in the letter, he or she should contact the secretariat.  I thank the CSO for asking us for our views.  We note and publish that.

We have a similar letter, No. 2498, which is almost a similar document.  There is a different date on it.  It is not on the schedule.  We wrote to the SBCI concerning the statement in its accounts of the number of employees assisted by the loans it has extended.  We said that was not a real figure.  The SBCI actually gave us a figure of total employment in organisations to which it advanced some portion of a loan.  This letter states that the average loan is approximately &euro;49,000, which is quite small.  It has already extended &euro;1.24 billion in loans.  It includes great information, including a county-by-county breakdown of the number of loans and their value for each year from 2015 to 2019.  It is very good information in which members might be interested.<\/p><p> The SBCI accepts that all it knows is the number of employees in organisations that have been assisted: \"As this is the only data we collect pertaining to employment, we are unable to fulfil directly the committee's request for a breakdown of the number of jobs supported by the SBCI, as distinct from the number of jobs in companies which receive funding or support from SBCI.\"  The correspondence goes on to state: \"We will keep our data-gathering under review to ensure that we can continue to provide the Committee with high-quality information that can assist in its review of the SBCl.\"<\/p><p> The correspondence answers our questions.  The SBCI now acknowledges that the figures submitted were overall totals.  It does not have a mechanism to produce more granular data.  It would be better not to put these inflated public relations-friendly figures in the accounts to give the impression that the SBCI is helping thousands of people when it has no information at all on the actual number of people assisted by the loans it has granted.<\/p><p> No. 2498 is a slight correction of No. 2471.  They are essentially the same.  I have outlined the essence of the letter.  We have made our point.  We will take the same query up with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.

This letter states: \"it is difficult to make a direct link between an individual SME taking out an SBCI loan or leasing product and that same SME creating a specific new job or maintaining a specific job that would otherwise have been lost.\"<\/p> <p>  The Chairman spoke about a glossy figure.  The SBCI put out an earlier statement in a letter to us claiming to support 148,000 jobs, but under a bit of scrutiny that does not seem to be the case.  The SBCI cannot tell us how many jobs it has actually supported.  This raises a question about value for money.  Is the SBCI just supporting loans that would have been offered anyway?

We might point out that it produces figures that are not relevant to its lending.  We have made that point.  The SBCI does not have the information we seek.  I will ask its officials to improve data collection.  Perhaps the application forms submitted by companies receiving loans funded by the SBCI should include a question on the number of new jobs the loan is expected to support or the number of jobs that will be specifically retained as a result.

It is hugely insightful in the context of our understanding of the system, particularly at a time when revaluations are happening across the country, including in my constituency.  It helps us to understand the zoning method and how it is based on the principle that the most valuable part of the shop is that closest to the street or mall.  Zoning occurs from the shop front backwards and there are reductions to it as one goes along.  It is interesting that it states that zoning is a tool, an aid to valuation, which must at all times be overruled by common sense.  I hope that is adhered to.<\/p><p>The revenue derived from rates accounts for &euro;1.5 billion, or 33% of current local government income.  In some cases, it provides as much as 53% of total funding for individual local authorities.  The Comptroller and Auditor General tries to have a yearly analysis of the flow of income into local government.  Last year, the Minister for Finance, touching on Exchequer contributions to the Local Government Fund, said:<\/p><blockquote>Turning to Local Government, 2019 will see a contribution from the Department&rsquo;s Vote to the Local Government Fund of &euro;185 million &ndash; an increase of &euro;60 million on 2018.  This will provide significant additional support to the local government sector in providing a range of essential services at local level ... and resources for certain local government initiatives across the country.<\/blockquote> <p>Four weeks ago, suddenly the Local Government Fund was cut by nearly &euro;30 million without a dickie bird of a mention.  I tabled a parliamentary question to ascertain how something could be cut by &euro;30 million in one year.  The answer pertained, supposedly, to the fact that support for local government in 2020 had be realigned, largely as a result of the valuation of Irish Water as a global utility for commercial rates.  From 2014 to 2019, compensation was paid to local authorities in lieu of commercial rates from Irish Water and Irish Water is liable for commercial rates from 2020.  In the Department's reckoning, compensation in lieu of commercial rates ceases and the apportionment of the valuation of Irish Water among local authorities from 2020 will be based on population.  This is similar to other global utility companies with national networks.  It highlights the difficulty in analysing the flow of income into local government.  In the reply to the parliamentary question, the Department went on to say that it expected the local authority sector to collect a broadly similar amount, and maybe even a greater amount in some cases, through commercial rates as was received in previous years through Exchequer funding for water rates compensation.  It said it would monitor the financial impact of the transition for local authorities.  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General highlight or analyse the real impact of this major realignment?  Some &euro;30 million has gone out with the stroke of a pen but the Department states that it will come back in another way, but it goes to the heart of the issues with the funding of the local government sector, which particularly worries me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#G00200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571904000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I would consider that any allocation of funding is in the policy domain so I cannot really comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I am not asking for the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the rights and wrongs of the apportionment but on the financial impact on the sector, which he analyses.

The expenditure is divided into four expenditure programmes which correspond to the four key strategic objectives set out the Department's statement of strategy for 2016 to 2019.<\/p><p>The share of the expenditure under each programme is indicated in the figure now on screen.<\/p><p> Appropriations-in-aid of the Vote in 2018 amounted to &euro;472 million.  Receipts from the EU comprised the bulk of these receipts.  In addition, the Department is the accredited paying agency for EU payments amounting to just over &euro;1.2 billion for 2018, which are accounted for separately from the Vote.  Note 6.1 to the appropriation account gives an overview of all EU funding handled by the Department.<\/p><p> The Department provides substantial funding each year for a number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  The Department is also directly responsible for management of the State's six fishery harbour centres, and reports in separate financial statements on the operations of the harbours.<\/p><p> At the year's end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;200 million less than provided for in the Estimates for 2018.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;22 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2019.  This was similar to the level of carry-over from 2017 to 2018, which related to underexpenditure under the forestry and bioenergy subhead.  The remainder of the surplus on the Vote for 2018, amounting to just over &euro;178 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the year's end.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.  I did, however, draw attention of the statement of the Accounting Officer on internal financial control, which discloses non-competitive procurement by the Department of &euro;17.75 million worth of goods and services in 2018.  This included a significant level of procurement that the Accounting Officer acknowledges was not compliant with relevant public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue for the Department.<\/p><p> Turning to chapter 10, on forestry grants, one of the Department's functions is the development and implementation of national and EU schemes in support of forestry and forestry support services, as members will be aware.  In the period 2015 to 2018, the Department spent a total of &euro;404 million on forestry development.  Most of the expenditure is in the form of grants to landholders for tree planting and maintenance of forest plantations.<\/p><p> The Department's current forestry programme is focused primarily on increasing the level of forest cover and supporting private forest holders in actively managing their forests.  The Department's annual targets for land to be afforested were also included in the national mitigation plan of 2017 on the basis that afforestation can assist in sequestering carbon dioxide and in meeting greenhouse gas emissions targets.<\/p><p> Up to the end of 2018, there has been consistent underexpenditure by the Department on the forestry programme.  The shortfall in 2018 between the amount provided and the actual expenditure was &euro;11 million, or almost 11%.  The average underspend over the period 2015 to 2018 was 9%.  The Department has stated that the underspend is mainly due to the lower than anticipated take-up of planting grants by landholders.  The Department set a performance target of grant-assisted planting of just over 27,000 ha in the period 2015 to 2018.  Over that period, around 22,500 ha was afforested - a shortfall of around 17%.<\/p><p> As a condition of state aid approval from the EU for the forestry programme, the Department was also required to target a rate of 30% of the area afforested annually to be planted with broadleaf trees.  The Department structured the grant rates payable with the aim of encouraging this type of planting.  However, the average achieved for the period 2015 to 2017 was just 20% broadleaf.  This increased to 27% in 2018.  The Department attributes the increase to higher grant rates introduced in February 2018 following a mid-term review of the forestry programme.  That review was also a requirement under the state aid approval.  <\/p><p> The Department carried out a cost-benefit analysis of the forestry programme in 2014, prior to the roll-out of the programme.  The mid-term review did not revise or update the analysis, even though a number of values associated with the key assumptions used have changed since then.  In addition to the changes in the value of the grants, there have been changes in the valuation of EU carbon dioxide emissions.

I would like to refer to the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account for 2018, and chapter 10 of the report on the accounts of the public service 2018 on forestry grants.<br\/><br\/>I will begin with the appropriation account.  The Department&rsquo;s gross Estimate for 2018 was &euro;1.586 billion.  This included a carry-over of capital savings of &euro;23.8 million from 2017.  In all, this represented an overall increase of &euro;97 million over the corresponding figure for 2017.  The gross outturn was &euro;1.546 billion, an increase of &euro;158 million over 2017.  The Department received a technical Supplementary Estimate to further address emerging priorities.  This provided extra funding which was almost entirely offset by additional appropriations-in-aid and also facilitated the transfer of funds within the Vote.  I will refer to this in my later remarks.<br\/><br\/>The Department also receives appropriations-in-aid which are unusually prominent in 2018 in the overall financial outcome.  These principally comprise EU receipts in respect of rural development, seafood development and animal disease programmes.  In 2018, these receipts amounted to &euro;471.8 million, some &euro;160 million more than the estimate of &euro;312 million.  The difference was substantially because of the timing of two large payments from the EU in respect of its co-funding of rural development programme schemes.  One of these, amounting to approximately &euro;82 million, was expected in December 2017 but was not received until January 2018.  A second receipt, expected in January 2019, was received in December 2018. <br\/><br\/>Turning back to expenditure, the Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided into four programmes, each representing a key policy priority.  Programme A relates to the food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes that underpin our agrifood sector.  These include disease eradication programmes such as those relating to tuberculosis, TB, or transmissable spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, testing for residues in food products, on-farm controls, plant protection controls and other such headings.  Programme expenditure under this heading, excluding staff and administration costs, amounted to just under &euro;87 million in 2018.  There was a minimal saving of &euro;200,000 compared with the budgeted amount.  I will comment on staff costs here because such costs constitute almost half of the expenditure on this programme and this programme accounts for more than half of the Department&rsquo;s total payroll.  This reflects the very strong investment in the skills, expertise and commitment of our staff who are the foundation of our food safety regime upon which our agrifood sector is so dependent.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Programme B covers our major farm support schemes other than the basic payment scheme, which is entirely EU funded.  By and large, these schemes are intended to encourage sustainable agricultural practices and most of them, other than the forestry programme, receive co-funding from the EU under the rural development programme.  The final allocation for these schemes in 2018, following a Supplementary Estimate, came to just over &euro;849 million.  This included an additional &euro;23 million to agri-environmental schemes and &euro;7 million for fodder schemes operated within the &quot;other schemes&quot; subhead provided through the Supplementary Estimate.<br\/><br\/>As members will recall, a range of severe weather conditions impacted severely on grass growth and feed supply and increased input costs for many livestock producers.  To help alleviate this situation, the standard 75% advance payment on certain EU co-funded schemes was increased to 85% and special national funded schemes were put in place to help boost the supply of fodder.  In 2018, almost 50,000 people participated in our GLAS scheme, more than 24,000 participated in the beef data and genomics scheme, and the sheep welfare and knowledge transfer schemes were launched.  Other co-funded schemes included the areas of natural constraint scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, farm investment scheme and the organics scheme.  The forestry programme alone among these schemes is 100% nationally funded.<br\/><br\/>The eventual outturn for this programme was &euro;823 million.  This was more than &euro;97 million greater than the previous year and reflects the mature stage we have reached in the rural development programme which has helped to allow us make a large portion of scheme year payments within the same the calendar year.<br\/><br\/>On the capital side, the TAMS investment scheme saw a much improved drawdown, with &euro;66.8 million expended, which is double the 2017 figure and reflected good levels of investment in on farm facilities, despite the difficult year for many producers.  Unfortunately, expenditure on the forestry programme was lower than hoped in 2018 and this remains a continuing but critically important challenge.  I will comment further in my remarks on the specific chapter on forestry grants in<b><\/b>the<b><\/b>report on the accounts of the public service 2018.  The capital carry-over into 2019 from 2018 was largely drawn from the forestry savings in 2018.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Programme C, policy and strategy, includes expenditure on research and training on a number of food support schemes, as well as grants to some of our State agencies.  It also included a number additional measures designed to help build resilience in the sector confronted by Brexit.  The largest of these was the Brexit response loan scheme where a &euro;25 million contribution was made to a scheme jointly established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Supplementary Estimate was also availed of to transfer relatively small savings which emerged in various parts of the Vote to respond to a specific request from the World Food Programme for the earliest possible release of the first element of funding under our 2019-21 strategic partnership agreement.  This resulted in payments of &euro;19 million to the World Food Programme in 2018.  Overall, the programme C outturn of &euro;370 million was &euro;5 million less than the voted allocation.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Programme D<b><\/b>relates to the seafood sector.  Expenditure under the programme part of this heading in 2018 amounted to &euro;118 million, 11% ahead of 2017, and included some &euro;24.6 million in the upgrading and development of fisheries harbours.  Approximately 88% of fish landed in Ireland are landed into the six centres owned by the Department.<i><\/i>Programme D also includes &euro;8 million under the seafood development programme, and grants-in-aid to the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  This programme also funded expenditure of almost &euro;10 million on the substantive completion of work on the remediation of the east tip project on Haulbowline Island.<br\/><br\/>As has been mentioned already, the Comptroller and Auditor General recently concluded an examination of forestry grants, the results of which have formed the basis of a chapter in the report on the accounts of the public service for<i><\/i>2018<i>.<\/i>The examination focused on the background to the forestry programme and its objectives, the outturn and activity of the programme, forestry grants in place and their administration.  The value for money aspects of the forestry programme are particularly important given that it is entirely Exchequer funded.  The report made two main recommendations and my responses to those recommendations are included in the chapter.  In summary, I fully agree with both recommendations which relate to cost-benefit analysis, forestry targets and the impacts of changes to grant rates.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>I very much welcome this analysis by the Comptroller and Auditor General and found it to be an extremely useful exercise in reviewing our practices and procedures on the payments of forestry grants.  The programme also raises broader policy questions which will be considered in the design of the next forestry programme.<br\/><br\/>The mid-term review of the current forestry programme, which took place in 2018, introduced several changes, including increased grant and premium rates, with the highest increases reserved for broadleaf categories.  This has already resulted in an increase in the proportion of broadleaves planted, which reached 27% in the year following the changes, compared with 21% in 2017.<br\/><br\/>A cost-benefit analysis will be undertaken as part of the development of the new forestry programme 2021-27, which is in line with the public spending code.  Preparation for the new programme is commencing and is dependent on the EU timeline for finalising the CAP regulations and the new state aid rules.  All aspects of the current programme will be reviewed as part of the development of the new programme.  The overall aim of the programme is to increase the national afforestation rate, which is currently 11%, well below the EU average of 43%.  The climate action plan 2019 outlined the ambitious target of planting 8,000 ha of new afforestation each year.  The new programme, in tandem with the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan for Ireland, will be focused on how to deliver on the goals of the climate action plan in particular.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their attention and welcome any follow-up questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>The lead speaker for today's meeting is Deputy Bobby Aylward who has 20 minutes.

That is how the legislation is written.  We have had approaches from various bodies over recent years explaining that they have significant potential for economic development.  Many cases have merit but we are constrained by the funding we have.  It would be nice to be able to help everybody to the extent that they wish, but that is just not possible.<\/p> <p>  There was an effort to cohere Horse Sport Ireland's efforts into a strategic policy plan.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, organised a committee and the body established a strategic plan for the industry, Reaching New Heights.  As a condition for additional funding, the Department commissioned a report by Indecon to look at the structures in Horse Sport Ireland.  It is unusual, being a company limited by guarantee.  It was established in 2007 and is an amalgamation between the Equestrian Federation of Ireland and what was the Irish Horse Board.  It had 27 different affiliate bodies, all of which were on the board.  While that had strengths with its representative nature, it was not a good way to structure a board and develop a strategic plan.  Indecon wrote its report and the board has been restructured.  We still have representatives of all the affiliates in advisory sub-committees, but that work has been done.  The Department has increased the funding bit by bit, from &euro;2.5 million in 2018 to &euro;3 million in 2019, and it will be &euro;4 million in 2020.

One of the issues that occurs to me is that I think it was designed to get people who are over 55 out of the system.  Forgive me for thinking now that 55 is not as old as I used to think it was.  The demographic issue in farming is not about 55 year olds, without prejudice to the competence of such people, and I am heading in that direction myself.  The focus we put in the previous CAP was on encouraging young people.  We had a number of incentives for young people.  I accept there is great reluctance among older farmers to pass down their land and get out.  This is something we must reflect on in the next CAP.  In doing so we must also reflect on the outcome of our previous study, which showed we were paying people for something that might have happened anyway and it was not really that effective.<\/p> <p>  There was another issue, which is that once people reached the age of 66 the payment was subtracted from the old age pension.  There were all kinds of complexities with the old system that limited its effectiveness.  I accept it is an issue.

The fact is that most of it related to receipts that arrived in early or late.  What we are looking at with the &euro;200 million is the net figure.  What happened was that we were expecting an &euro;82 million receipt in respect of the rural development fund to arrive in 2017 and it arrived in 2018.  Equally, our assessment was that because of changes in EU legislation we would not get some of the rural development funding for 2018 until 2019 and we actually got it in 2018.  The bulk of it is made up of two very large receipts.  It is not that we spent &euro;200 million less than we had, it is that we got appropriations-in-aid to a significant amount of it.  The actual spending figure was &euro;40 million.  We spent &euro;40 million less than we had.  The reason for this is that when we have rural development schemes we make prudent provision for what might mature during the year but they are demand led and if the demand does not arise the money cannot be spent.<\/p><p>When we set up the TAMS scheme, which was previously the agricultural investment scheme, we made what was not the best decision, which was that once people had an approval, they had three years to deliver on the investment.

To give the Deputy some perspective, which does not absolve us from responsibility, we have approximately &euro;100 million worth of procurement in the Department, of which &euro;3.9 million is self-declared as non-compliant.  That is unacceptable.  We have done a lot of work to improve our procurement systems in recent years.  We have established a procurement office.  Every division has a procurement liaison officer so that when procurements are made, they can guide people and explain the rules to them.  There is an issue with the accumulation of contracts.  Non-compliant contracts remain on the list until they are excised, at which point we move on.  Overall, our level of non-compliant procurement is diminishing.  Our objective clearly is to get that down to zero.  We need to look at some of our systems.  I will give the Deputy an example of how this might happen, which again is not intended as an excuse but as an explanation of the administrative inadequacies that might lead to this happening.  If we have a dispersed laboratory service and it is buying laboratory disposables such as test tubes and so on, it is possible that people in different places could be procuring from the same company without sight the overall picture.  That is something we have to resolve.  A significant part of this &euro;3.9 million was in the laboratory service.

In 2018, in particular, we were considerably below target.  In other years improvements were made, but in 2018, the very year in which we were all coming under pressure on climate change, it was down.  I would have thought a mid-term review in February 2018 would have looked at climate change and many other variables.  What was done with broadleaves was welcome.  Why was the mid-term review so specific and restricted?  Why has no cost benefit analysis been made since?  I understand the Department had to do it before it and that is good, but it has not been done since.  Mr. Gleeson is talking about doing it in the future.  I do not know whether the best terminology to use is a cost benefit analysis, a review or a post-project review.  However, nothing was done, except a limited mid-term review with very restricted criteria.<\/p><p> The forestry programme lists ten criteria.  There are 11 measures listed on page 147 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The forestry programme focuses on two.  Measures 1 and 3 accounted for 95% of the spend in 2018, the very year in which the level of planting was down.  That means that nine other measures were not getting a look in.  Interestingly, the ones that got in were the construction of forest roads to allow access and native woodlands, on which progress was made, which I welcome.  However, some of the other measures are very good, including close-to-home woodlands, I imagine in city and rural areas and so on.  I would have thought a review would have looked at all of these to see why they were not being pushed because, presumably, they were equally as important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#T09000","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571904000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I am not sure at what page of the report the Deputy is looking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019102400002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1571904000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>It is page 147 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the chapter on measures included in the forestry programme for the period 2014 to 2020.

There is an argument that the only way to reduce emissions is to cull the herd but there are tiny farmers with five or six head of cattle - usually bad, old cows that nobody else wants - as a hobby, although I mean them no disrespect.  The issue is that many small farmers have inefficient animals, which might be infertile or might not produce good milk, and they contribute to the overall negative picture.  As Mr. Gleeson noted, however, we must breed and feed correctly, and get as many calves as possible from each cow before returning them to production and sending the calves and milk to wherever.

My children tell me that they should not have palm oil.  I do not even know if we have palm oil in the house.  I tell them that eating steak is good for them.  There is a narrative that quinoa and soy that come all the way across the world are better for us.  I do not see the message about the protein of high biological value in our meat.

I understand the pricing when it comes to euro, but let us talk about the product first because it is about the product and the price can vary between sterling, euro and everything else.  The value of what we sold to the UK last year was &euro;5.5 billion but the value of what we imported was &euro;4.5 billion.  That is not a major difference.

When one looks at those charts, they look kind of similar but the right hand figures have been shrunk to make them look different.

We have to go through it to see the amount on the right-hand side, where the gaps are different.  That is one of the issues I wanted to raise.

We knew we were importing quite an amount of food, because we see it on our supermarket shelves, but I thought we were exporting more than double of what we were importing.  It now transpires that it is the other way around.  We will come to the price and the monetary value in due course.<\/p><p> I refer to prepared consumer foods.  The Department's chart states that the prepared consumer foods sector, which is obviously the convenience-type foods many people want, accounted for more than &euro;2.6 billion in agrifood sector exports in 2018, and &euro;3.6 billion in imports.  Ireland is importing far more prepared consumer foods for consumption than we are exporting.

Ireland was exporting more foodstuffs than it was importing ten years ago.  This is the myth we have all lived on.  In the last ten year - this has nothing to do with Brexit - the level of imports of foodstuffs has increased at a much higher rate.  In fact, it has more than doubled in the last decade.  The product, not the price, of our exports has only gone from approximately 4 million tonnes to 7 million tonnes, an increase of 3 million tonnes, whereas our imports have gone from 6 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes.  The public is not aware that in the last decade, Ireland has changed in respect of how it deals with food and in the last decade - this has nothing to do with Brexit - we have far surpassed our food consumption in terms of  imports as opposed to what we export.

It is possible that the animals we saw on that television programme were formerly involved in the greyhound racing industry, although they may not have been.  I do not know.  I am not sure.  The point I am making is that many things are happening in the canine industry that are not connected to racing greyhounds.  That is a subset.  This is about animal welfare.  People are as concerned about puppies, little terriers, or nice labradors being mistreated as about greyhounds being mistreated.  We have concentrated on greyhounds because there is a State body involved in the area at which we and the public can have a go.  The Irish Coursing Club, ICC, however, is a private organisation and gets no funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In following this issue in recent meetings, I have been mystified as to why a private organisation is stitched into national legislation.  It is a policy matter but, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would say that, if we are interested in animal welfare, it makes no sense that a private charity with no public accountability can be responsible for registration in the canine industry, of which the Irish Greyhound Board is only a subset.

I welcome the chance to update the committee on the tracker mortgage examination.  The scale of banks&rsquo; tracker mortgage failings was industry-wide, causing distressing and, in some cases, devastating consequences for customers.  It necessitated a robust and comprehensive regulatory response that required banks to identify affected customers and to redress and compensate them for the harm the banks had caused.  The examination was that regulatory response.  It is the largest, most complex and significant consumer protection review the Central Bank has undertaken, probing all banks who ever offered tracker mortgage products in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The framework required lenders to conduct the examination in four phases.  These were development and submission of detailed plans; information gathering, review and report submission; calculation of redress and compensation levels; and implementation of the redress programme.  Together, these constituted the supervisory phases of the examination and the final report was issued as these phases concluded.  In the final report, we indicated that banks' payment of redress and compensation was nearing completion.  Today, as banks close out their redress and compensation schemes, a total of &euro;693 million in redress and compensation has been paid to affected customers.  The number of customers identified by lenders as impacted is 40,500.  Banks have now paid 98% of those affected.  In the final report, we described the devastating impact that the banks&rsquo; failings had on those customers, with 99 people losing their homes and 216 people losing their investment properties.<\/p> <p>  The examination, as members are aware, required lenders to undertake an initial review of more than 2 million mortgage accounts to identify the number of in-scope accounts before extensive Central Bank challenge of those reviews.  We were determined that everyone who should have been included in the scope of the examination was included and we pushed the banks to include them where we had a basis to do so.  As a result of our challenge and intervention, the banks were forced to include 20,000 additional customers in their redress and compensation programmes.  In terms of the range of redress and compensation payments, 57% of redress and compensation payments were up to the value of &euro;10,000, 32% received amounts in the &euro;10,000 to &euro;50,000 range, 8% of offers were between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 and 3% of affected customers received in excess of &euro;100,000.  There were 23 customer accounts that received in excess of &euro;500,000, including 22 who lost properties.<\/p> <p>  The final report concluded on the review and remediation phase of the examination and set out the assurance process the Central Bank carried out in order to reach this conclusion.  This assurance work included desk-based reviews, intrusive on-site inspections, data verification work, scrutiny of lenders' data returns and regular engagement with lenders.  In excess of 3,000 days were spent completing Central Bank on-site work alone throughout the course of the examination.  Our supervisory work is now complete but we continue to monitor the outcomes of any complaints, appeals and court cases, and if any new information of a systemic nature comes to light, we will investigate it fully.  The channels available to consumers under the framework will continue to deliver outcomes.  We both welcome any additional uplift in redress and compensation that affected customers may gain through these channels and remain vigilant in case any outcome has potential wider application to others.  We are also conducting enforcement investigations in respect of the main banks and I will return to that subject shortly.<\/p> <p>  We are conscious that no amount of money will ever fully right the wrongs that have been done by the banks, particularly to customers who lost their family homes.  However, we designed the tracker framework to maximise the chances of those affected customers securing appropriate redress and compensation.  It may be helpful at this point to say a word about the objectives of the framework.  In Ireland and other countries, we have seen in the past examples of redress schemes that have been quasi-judicial or adversarial in nature.  Sometimes that is for very understandable legal reasons but often it can add to the stress and financial impact on those affected.  The tracker framework was designed to avoid that.  Put simply, the framework was designed to drive redress and compensation to those affected without those customers having to raise a complaint, or pursue litigation.  This gave customers the option, if they so wished, of avoiding the costs and stress of a public adversarial process.  We were of the view that they were dealing with enough financial and personal strain as it was.<\/p> <p>  Under the framework, we first required the banks to identify groups of customers affected by tracker issues and to redress and compensate those groups.  The customers were not required to take any action to secure that initial redress and compensation.  The money was paid out upfront to people and they could choose what next steps they wished to take.  Second, we required the banks to provide an appeals avenue free of charge and this meant that customers could appeal the initial redress and compensation they received from their bank at no cost to them and, importantly, without risking the initial award.  They could cash the cheque, so to speak, safe in the knowledge that their initial award could not be lowered or taken from them.  Customers also received a separate payment, which could be used by the customer to pay for independent advice on the adequacy of the lender's initial redress and compensation offer.<\/p> <p>  Third, we ensured customers retained their legal rights to pursue other avenues if they wished to do so.  We required that banks would not rely on the statute of limitations to deny affected customers who might otherwise have been time-barred from bringing a claim.  This was in the time before the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman limitation periods were amended.  Customers could appeal to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, a service which is free to the customer, and they could take court proceedings without putting the awards they had already received at risk.  Our framework was constructed in a way to drive redress and compensation to affected customers while leaving all elements of the State consumer protection system open to them.  I recognise that this took some time but it meant nobody had to battle alone.  I recognise the role of this committee in giving a voice to affected customers.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, we have clearly communicated to banks our expectation that if any individual outcomes come to light that have the potential to affect customers more widely, they must consider and address the broader customer impact.  I reiterate that we will continue to monitor the outcomes of any appeals, complaints to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and court cases, and we will utilise our statutory powers as required to seek information from banks in respect of those outcomes.  In line with this approach, we will insist on regulatory scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding litigation outcomes to identify any broader systemic customer impact.<\/p> <p>  Moving to enforcement, we take robust enforcement action that holds firms and individuals to account, deters misconduct and promotes compliance and high standards in financial services.  We use the full suite of our powers and publish details of enforcement actions where we are legally permitted to do so, together with public statements outlining the standards we require of regulated firms and individuals.  To date, we have concluded 131 enforcement actions resulting in penalties of almost &euro;100 million. With respect to the tracker scandal, forensic investigations are ongoing and we are examining various lender failings, including the actions of individuals that may be relevant to establishing how and why customers lost their trackers.  As the investigations began at different times, they will conclude at different times but the gravity with which we view tracker-related failings is demonstrated by the &euro;21 million fine we imposed on PTSB earlier this year, the largest fine we have ever imposed on a regulated firm.  In all, PTSB admitted 42 separate regulatory breaches.<\/p> <p>  Committee members will appreciate that I cannot discuss ongoing enforcement investigations but it is worth discussing some of the detail from the concluded PTSB case and the public statement we issued.  The investigation sought to determine how and why the failures to fulfil regulatory obligations to protect its tracker mortgage customers' best interests and honour their contractual entitlements occurred.  The investigation found that PTSB denied its customers a tracker mortgage or did not put them on the correct tracker rate resulting from a number of failings.<\/p><p>These included failure to warn certain customers about the consequences of decisions they might make relating to their mortgages when breaking early from a fixed or discounted interest rate; operational and systems failings; a decision to deny certain customers the correct tracker rate between 2009 and 2010; and incorrect legal interpretation of contractual terms and conditions.  This is just one enforcement case against one bank.  It required scrutiny of a significant amount of documentation spanning lengthy periods and the conduct of interviews with junior and, more importantly, more senior role holders across a number of business areas as part of that process to establish precisely the facts and the matters under investigation.  As we noted in our public statement, PTSB engaged purposefully and co-operatively with the investigation, which is to its credit.  However, this has not necessarily been the Central Bank's experience with every bank under investigation, and we have taken robust action where appropriate.  I remind each and every bank under active investigation that co-operation with the regulator is a basic expectation of ours in the context of engagement with firms, whether in a supervisory or enforcement context, and that any lack of co-operation can have a considerable bearing on subsequent sanctions.<\/p><p> This brings me to the issue of culture.  Cultural failings within the banking sector were a significant contributory factor in the tracker mortgage scandal.  Disappointingly, these failings did not stop once the examination was launched.  For example, we set out clear instructions to banks requiring them to stop the harm being caused to customers at the earliest possible opportunity.  The \"stop the harm\" principles were designed to ensure that where banks identified affected customers, no further detriment was caused.  Through on-site inspections we found evidence that certain banks failed to comply with these principles, which will be considered in the context of the ongoing enforcement investigations.  It is the role of the boards and senior leadership teams to ensure that the right culture is embedded in their firms.  They must define a set of values and guidelines for desired behaviour and lead by example.  It is not enough to talk the culture talk.  One must walk the walk as well.<\/p><p> When the Central Bank published its behaviour and culture report last summer, we reported that while all banks had taken steps to reinforce consideration of the consumer interest, some banks were more advanced than others and all had a distance to travel.  Banks were required to submit behaviour and culture plans to us outlining how they would address the key risks we had identified.  The majority of the banks were then required to resubmit their plans when we deemed the original ones insufficient or, frankly, inadequate.  We will continue to monitor and challenge the banks assertively on the delivery of their behaviour and culture plans in order that they deliver for their customers.<\/p><p> Like most regulators, however, I am a realist rather than an optimist.  I believe an extra nudge in the system is required to push regulated firms to behave properly.  The Central Bank already has strong powers spanning an expansive mandate.  One of these powers, which rarely features in public debate but of which industry is well aware, is our gatekeeping role under the fitness and probity regime.  Put simply, where we believe an individual firm is proposing someone ill-qualified or unsuitable for a senior role, we will challenge that appointment.  We take our gatekeeping role extremely seriously, and to date, since the commencement of the regime, 80 applications for senior positions have been withdrawn where the Central Bank has challenged the applicant.<\/p><p> While we use our existing powers to great effect in keeping unfit individuals out of financial services and pursing individual wrongdoing where it occurs, we believe that individual accountability within the sector can be further strengthened via amendments to the legislative framework.  A lack of accountability is widely seen as a key driver of misconduct, and we have therefore proposed to Government that it legislate for individual accountability measures to drive better behaviour.  These include proposed enforceable conduct standards for staff in regulated firms, such as acting honestly, ethically and with integrity; additional conduct standards for senior management; and standards for businesses.  We also propose changes that would significantly reduce the chances of key people in firms being able to wash their hands of wrongdoing.  We propose a senior executive accountability regime that would place obligations on firms and senior individuals to set out clearly where the responsibility and decision-making lies in their businesses.  We see this as a key prong of our culture change strategy.  We have previously discussed these recommendations with this committee so I do not propose to say any more about them, but we continue to work with the Department of Finance to progress these proposals.<\/p><p> From what we have seen in the tracker mortgage examination and from the customers whose stories we have heard, I know that people and families continue to live with the consequences.  The banks that caused this damage will not be permitted to move on as if it were business as usual.  At every step of the examination our focus has been on affected customers and ensuring lenders pay them appropriate redress and compensation.  While the supervisory phase of the examination has now concluded, its outcomes will be taken forward and reflected in our continuing supervision and enforcement investigations.<\/p><p> I thank the committee.

More importantly, we looked at the groups of customers who were excluded by the lenders.  As the committee members know, through our work and the work of this committee, the lenders were forced to include 20,000 more customers than they originally wished.  I absolutely recognise that not everyone who wished to have a better-priced tracker received one.  I can fully understand their disappointment.  Where the requirements we had to look at provided a basis to go to bat for customers and require the lenders to include them in the redress programme, we absolutely did so.<\/p> <p>  We designed this programme to work with the other parts of the national framework.  The redress and compensation scheme is an extra option for people who have been affected.  They can absolutely go to the ombudsman or to court as they wish.  If customers have been included in the redress programme, they can always take the payment upfront and try to do better for themselves with the ombudsman.  It is important to remember that the ombudsman has a very different statutory mandate from that of the Central Bank, which can be very beneficial to the customers.  That process allows customers to bring their personal information to the ombudsman.  The lender also has to answer to the ombudsman and new information can thus come to light.  When the ombudsman makes a decision, the statutory basis on which he does so is different from ours.  That can be of benefit to us if any issues arise from cases.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the feedback loop on cases before the ombudsman.  It is working well.  We are in dialogue with the ombudsman.

New information may emerge, and if that gives us another angle from which to examine this on behalf of customers, we will of course do so.  We also expect lenders to look at that new information.  Where it is of wider applicability, we expect them to give the benefit of that read-across to the customers.  That is part of the current framework.  We are in dialogue with the ombudsman about cases.  We will look at any issues he refers to us that raise concerns.  We also expect the lenders to do that work.

I do not believe I need to tell this committee in view of the fact that it was active and part of the national level pressure that was brought to bear on the lenders.  I took up this role on 1 September 2017 and I appeared before the committee shortly thereafter.  I had previously been director of enforcement.  I set up the redress scheme with Permanent TSB, which was a precursor to this.  New in that role, I was utterly dissatisfied with the stance of the lenders.  We made that public in a report at the time, and I remember appearing before this committee and answering questions.  With fantastic support from colleagues and the team in the Central Bank, I spent many weeks and months in challenging meetings with the lenders, giving them the full benefit of our analysis and views about who should be in and out.  Members will recall that we wrote a report stating that the lenders had decided to resolve the disputed groups in favour of our judgment.  I am sad to say that it appeared to take a level of public opprobrium and pressure from a number of angles for them to reach that view.  That should never have been the case.<\/p> <p>  The key leading risk in cultural indicators that we saw as a precursor to that was the fact that the team in the Central Bank had to do more than 200 turns of the documents in the compensation award levels.  The level of co-operation was absolutely not where it should have been.  That is why we are certain about a continued focus on demanding that they deliver different cultural standards.  A culture is nothing but one's value set and how one behaves.  We will continue to hold them to account in that regard.  I have told the committee that I am a realist, not an optimist, and we believe that an individual accountability framework is necessary to strengthen the position further.  It can been seen on the cutting edge of leading international regulatory frameworks, including the Financial Stability Board, which recently stated that a key feature of misconduct scandals was a lack of individual accountability.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our comments on co-operation, we have been deliberate in sharing that perspective with the committee.  In some of the enforcement investigations, what we have experienced is a slow pace and long answers with no delivery of the goods that we want.  We have an able team that can hold lenders that indulge in that kind of tactic with us to account.  It is not something that we tolerate.  If there is a lack of co-operation in enforcement investigations and that is not remedied in the course of the investigation, we will apply to the High Court to demand that we get what we need.  We do that where we need to.  Matters have been resolved earlier than that step being taken, but to push us near to having to take it is unacceptable.  If enforcement cases conclude, an issue we take into account in penalties is co-operation.  I will ask my colleague, Ms Cunningham, to say a few words about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":765,"content":"<p>She might clarify whether those are ongoing pressures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#J00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":766,"content":"<p>We wanted to communicate clearly concerning an expectation about co-operation that was not necessarily being met.

Every tracker mortgage is examined in detail by the banks to determine whether it has been affected and is in scope.  In these cases, the banks have determined that the mortgages have not been affected or have not been affected to the degree that the customers believe.  The Central Bank has supervised and signed off on that, meaning it again falls to the customer - we know that not all customers do this - to make the complaint and argument, to fight with the bank, to challenge its rationale and modalities and to win out finally, at which point the Central Bank says it is delighted with that.

The Central Bank was asleep at the wheel regarding the earlier period of this investigation.  Customers who took cases to the then Financial Services Ombudsman, including extended family members of mine, had to wait four years as Permanent TSB dragged a test case through the ombudsman service, the High Court and then the Supreme Court and for campaigners, including this committee, to write to the Central Bank instructing it to take action on behalf of the customers that are affected.  We know today that 40,500 of those customers are affected.  The Central Bank did nothing during that period to protect those customers.  It investigated the banks individually and then closed those investigations knowing that there were 33,000 additional customers affected.  It was left to those individuals to argue and fight their cases without the support of the Central Bank.  That is the reality of the situation.  This may have happened before Ms Rowland was employed in the Central Bank but that is the reality.  That is the stain on the Central Bank in regard to the tracker mortgage investigation.  This is without doubt the banks' responsibility because they were the culprits.  Where was the role of the Central Bank in protecting consumers?  Where was its role between 2012 and 2015 when the investigation was launched and customers were left on their own?  I was in the room with some of these people as they were on the phone to the banks.  The banks were telling them that they were not entitled to a tracker mortgage and the people were in tears.  I sat at the kitchen tables of many of these individuals.  I know many of them.  These people fought the system and did not get the support of all the State agencies but they were unwilling to be silenced and, as a result of going all the way to the Supreme Court, forced the State agencies into this investigation, which uncovered the greatest theft in the history of this State.<\/p> <p>  Ms Rowland may dispute everything I said but perhaps she will tell me if the Central Bank has learned any lessons regarding its approach to this investigation given what is now known in terms of the magnitude of what was going on under its nose in respect of 11 banks in this State, which robbed their customers of their own money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#K00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>There is a lot in what the Deputy had to say.  The only reason we are here is to work for customers in the public interest.  It is the reason the team and I turn up to work every day.  I acknowledge that this should not have happened and customers should never have been put in this position, but the Central Bank did a lot of work before this examination was put in place to strengthen the policy framework, to get tracker mortgages returned to more than 7,000 people and to stop tracker mortgages being taken from people.  When I was director of enforcement, I challenged the ombudsman's decisions.<\/p> <p>  In the case of Permanent TSB, we front-ran the consumer redress principles in the course of the enforcement investigation, precisely because there was litigation in place and we knew we had to act on behalf of customers because we were concerned, particularly about the impact on people who might lose their homes.  We could see that despite every effort that was being made, more was needed.  This extraordinary examination was necessitated and has been done and more than 2 million accounts have been put in place.  The Central Bank is a learning organisation.  It is right that we reflect on how to strengthen our approach to supervision.  Lessons have been learned.  No doubt, we can learn more over time and we will do so because it is right that we always iterate to act to best practice.<\/p> <p>  We have strengthened our own approach to supervision with the consumer protection risk assessment model that is more structured and intrusive.  We have strengthened our approach to focusing on the financial services companies that pose the most risk to consumers, these being the big banks with which we all interact and which sell us the most products in their daily lives.  From where I sit - I am sure Ms Cunningham and Ms McEvoy will support me in this - our job is to serve customers, to make sure that we do that job to the best of our technical abilities, to learn at all times and to strengthen our models of supervision.

I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank last May.  There were two parts to what I wrote.  One part was a protected disclosure, which the Central Bank is investigating, but the other part, which I am happy to talk about, was in relation to an out-of-court settlement that happened in respect of Permanent TSB and a prevailing rate case.  This was covered extensively in the media at the time, particularly in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  The <i>Irish Independent<\/i>would have covered it as well.  Permanent TSB settled with a customer on the prevailing rate but with a confidentiality clause.  As Ms Rowland will know there are hundreds if not thousands of people who will argue with Permanent TSB that they are on the wrong rate, that they are within scope and that the bank is wrong.  They will argue that they are on the wrong rate as a result of the prevailing rate.  The situation I am extremely concerned about is where somebody is willing to take on the system, put his or her money on the line, go to the courts and all of the rest of it and where Permanent TSB will settle on the steps of the court but with a confidentiality clause which means nobody else will know why it settled or why that risk was removed from the bank.<\/p><p>As I said, I wrote to the Central Bank in May.  I got a response that dealt with the protected disclosure and saying that I would get a response to the other part.  To my knowledge I did not get that response but that could be my mistake.  Can the witnesses explain to me what action the Central Bank has taken in relation to the out-of-court settlement and the confidentiality clause that has been placed on this individual?  It is my understanding, although we can never be sure because there is a confidentiality clause, that this is extremely like the cases that are before the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, if not quite identical to them.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has no insight into these cases, and he has responded to my letter.  He asked me to bring it to the attention of the Central Bank.  I am quite interested to hear this, because this is not the first time I have raised an out-of-court settlement and a gagging clause with the Central Bank.<\/p><p>There is another issue that I have asked the Central Bank to investigate which affects thousands of customers, but maybe it is for another day.  It is about payment protection, and I have engaged with, and provided a dossier to, the Central Bank on that issue.<\/p><p>I just want to focus on the tracker rate, the prevailing rate and out-of-court settlements.

He could not take information from anybody else but he will be able to speak to that better.<\/p> <p>  I am going to talk a bit about litigation settlements and confidentiality and our approach.  There are three things I should say to the committee.  Being a lawyerly type formerly, I know that going to court is a really difficult thing for customers, and not everybody would want to do that.  There would be good reason for people who wish to settle.  Some people want to be private about that and do not want their information known to others.  The Deputy will appreciate that.  In fact, I think Irish people are very private about those types of things.  Nobody wants to see a gagging clause being used to prevent important information reaching people who have an oversight duty or a role in the system like we do.  If one sees a classic settlement, it can have very little information in it at all.  It could even be as short as a page, saying here is an amount.  The Deputy is absolutely right that non-disclosure agreements can be contained and kept private.  However, some individuals want their business to be private, and that of course is to be respected.  Our role, as a regulator, is to make sure we have effective oversight of the system.<\/p><p>We intend to have that and we will have it.  We see the feedback loops as important bases for affording us an opportunity to see if there is extra, fresh or new information that we could take into account or to determine whether we should require the lenders to look at that and do the read-across, which we have told them we expect.  That will not stand in our way when we are asking the relevant questions about the basis of settlements and so on.  Much of that information is not contained in the relevant documents.

I want to acknowledge the work that is done.  However, when I look back through it and look through the Official Report, I am prompted to inquire about what the Central Bank is doing differently.

We did a considerable body of work here as did many other people.  If the investigation was not undertaken by the Central Bank it would have never come to light.

Ms Rowland used the language of transformation and our approach has been exactly that.  We have moved away from a sectoral approach of looking at the banks because we now recognise that they are the firms that can impose the greatest harm on consumers.  We are intensifying our scrutiny of those institutions.  We are challenging them through a series of multiple engagements throughout the year at board and executive level throughout the organisation.  We are challenging their business models, their assessment of risk, how they monitor and actually instil a culture of consumer focus within their organisations.  I will give the Senator some examples of the kind of thing we would expect to see in that context.  He is familiar with the report we issued last year that highlighted that all of the five retail banks have a journey to travel in terms of really embedding a consumer-focused culture.  Ms Rowland and I spoke to the boards of those institutions after we had concluded that report in order to convey our expectations and our findings on the individual firms.  We talk about having a robust risk management framework in place, having strategies and operational business models.  What we mean in practice is that those institutions truly have the customer at the core of their operations.  They have multiple committees, as the Senator and I both know.  Those committees make decisions regarding whether products that are going to be launched are profitable for the firms but they should also consider whether it is suitable for customers.  They decide, for example, whether they are products that the Senator or I might actually buy; that the risks are not unnecessarily high; and that a product is affordable to the customer and delivers what he or she wants.  Rather than having \"speak up \"policies gathering dust on a shelf, we want those organisation to be able to provide evidence and show us when we go out on site that there is a culture of speaking up within them, that the individuals who work there can trust and have confidence that if they do speak up, they will be listened to and that they can call out bad behaviours.  We want them not just to incentivise, reward or promote individuals on sales targets, as it is not all about commercial decisions and sales, but also to promote individuals who deliver good outcomes for the consumers.

In her statement Ms Rowland refers to the \"Cultural failings within the banking sector\" and that \"Disappointingly, those failings did not stop once the examination was launched.\"  Are the banks afraid of the Central Bank or do they still regard the Central Bank as, effectively, something they can ignore at their whim and as they wish?

Tracker mortgages were returned to individuals before this examination ever got under way in 2015, as far back as 2010.  Banks were stopped from taking people off tracker mortgages.  That was a silent win, if I can say it that way.  As far back as 2008, public warnings were issued to lenders warning them about their duty to act in customers' best interest when recommending to them that they should switch from a tracker mortgage to another product.  The Senator will recall that there may have been a good price associated with giving up a tracker mortgage and opting for a fixed rate at that point.  It changed later.  In 2009, public notices were made.  In 2009, 224 customers were not given their contractual entitlement and the Central Bank addressed that issue.  What was happening was that issues of all kinds were arising over time with tracker mortgages.  Before the examination was launched, approximately 7,100 people were given back tracker mortgages.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, I cannot agree that no work was done by the Central Bank.  Policy strengthening was carried out and warnings were issued to banks.  Efforts were made to make sure customers did not lose tracker mortgages.  People got tracker mortgages back, but what really happened was that the more the Central Bank did work, the more the issue seemed to come to light.  We were working in the enforcement investigation in Permanent TSB and it made sense to set up a redress or compensation mechanism.  The lenders caused the unprecedented need for such a mechanism.  I am aware the Senator has not been satisfied with our answer on that, but of course I wish that more was done.  I wish that this did not happen.  It was wrong that it did happen, and I fully accept that.<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms McEvoy to talk about the interaction with the ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":896,"content":"<p>We have an open and collaborative arrangement with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, as the Senator might expect.

There are, however, many people still badly affected.  As well as examining the past, I would like some indication as to what will happen to those still embroiled.<\/p> <p>  I raised with the Central Bank on a number of occasions the circumstances of the Bank of Ireland staff tracker group.  In late 2006 and early 2007, Bank of Ireland offered a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage product to staff in the bank.  It was at the ECB rate at the time plus 0.75%.  The individuals were promised that they could transfer to a tracker mortgage when the term of the fixed rate ended, after two years.  Some 2,000 Bank of Ireland staff were affected by this.  Over time, 1,800 were transferred by Bank of Ireland to a tracker mortgage, but for some unknown reason, 200 were not able to transfer.  These were staff at various levels, from management level to administrative and branch levels.  There is a dossier on how some of the individuals and their families have been affected.  In some cases, their health has been broken and their careers have been badly damaged.  They have written to the Central Bank.  They wrote to the previous Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, and set out the details.  They, as bankers, set out all the reasons, including the technical reasons, they should be transferred to the appropriate tracker mortgage at the appropriate rate.  They have literally been going around in circles ever since with no redress at all.<\/p> <p>  The group of 200 seems entirely arbitrary.  They might just have been at the end of the list, or else there was some time-based feature.  I can see no reason 1,800 staff had their arrangements settled by Bank of Ireland and 200 were left out in the cold.  The latter have not received any kind of adequate response from the Central Bank.  I do not know whether the delegates feel they are walking on eggshells because of Bank of Ireland and that it is not within the Central Bank's capacity to act, offering clarity and an explanation as to why the 200 have been left aside.  They continue to seek to be transferred to a tracker mortgage.  They have suffered all the outcomes that individuals have indicated in previous testimonies to the banks themselves and to the Central Bank.  Marriages have broken down, careers have been affected, and a number of individuals have suffered bad health.  While much of the focus is understandably on Permanent TSB and while I, too, can tell harrowing stories about that bank, I do not understand why the members of the group in Bank of Ireland have been left out.<\/p><p>Having gone through all of their documentation with them again recently, I am convinced they have a strong case as to be offered redress.<\/p><p> In her opening statement, Ms Rowland outlined a good policy - Stop the Harm - with regard to expectations on behaviour and culture.  I very much welcome this.  It is a major advance by the Central Bank and I congratulate the people who formulated it.  It is based on approaches that have existed in other jurisdictions with which I am familiar.  Many of the people in the group in Bank of Ireland have been destroyed by the failure to obtain redress.  They are going from one group of people to another, including the bank itself and its mortgage support team, which sounds like a slightly ironic title.  These people continue to pay their mortgages but many of them are now embroiled in heavy mortgage debt.  Given the principles enunciated in Stop the Harm, can the Central Bank offer any hope to this group that the issue can be redressed?  How have 1,800 people been sorted out while 200 people, for whom there is no evidence of any particular distinction, have been left to struggle and endure the type of suffering with which the Central Bank eloquently empathised in Ms Rowland's opening statement?

We pushed to the limit of what we could.  We did push against the lenders' view that those affected were a far more narrow group.  The Deputy will recall the time we came here when the lenders had accepted approximately 13,000 customers for inclusion.  That number has swelled since then, which tells us just how wrong it was.<\/p> <p>  As we went through the basis upon which our decisions were made, and we took the most pro-customer point of view, we got lots of cases included in the tracker mortgage examination.  For example, we looked at the terms and conditions set out in the mortgage.  If people were entitled to a tracker on the face of it, that is precisely what they got.  I totally recognise that some customers are disappointed with the rate of the tracker they got but we pushed it as far as we could.  We also required lenders to look at the customer journey.  This means it is not just about the contract.  It was about any information provided to them in the sales process, any advertisement on television being run at the time and any other documentation that might have given people an expectation of a tracker.  Where we could see a basis where that transpired to be the case, we pushed for people to be included.  We certainly saw many customers get tracker mortgages on that basis.  Customers might have started on a tracker and moved to a fixed rate because the price was better and it was not clear when they moved off a fixed rate.  Some of them moved two or three times and it was the original documentation that had tracker promises in it and not the documentation for the second or third moves.  Some of those customers also got trackers.  We also looked at the disclosure regimes and whether they made it clear enough to customers over time and they also yielded cases.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry that some customers have been disappointed where we could not find a basis to force the lenders.  This is one of those groups where we could not find a basis for us to force the lenders to include them.  We understand the disappointment of people and their families.  It is important to us if information does come to light from another source.  We have been clear about the feedback loop and that it is important to work together in the national framework.  A total of 2 million accounts were scrutinised.  While many people who would wish to have a tracker rate did not get one, many have been included.  Where we could have a basis to include customers on tracker rates, we pushed for them.  Other fora have different criteria to us.  For example, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has a much wider filter than the Central Bank.  The statutory framework within which he can operate has a very wide discretionary basis.  I am sure he can speak to the committee himself about that basis.  We did the most we could yet I am absolutely sorry for people and families who have suffered and I understand it very well.  We did the most we could.  My colleague, Ms McEvoy, might want to say something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":900,"content":"<p>Ms Rowland has articulated it very well with regard to those who have been included and the various reasons and circumstances in which they have been included, including where there was a lack of transparency about the rates people were offered and expectations set out in marketing information and flyers.

There are many different customer journeys, even with employees of the same bank, that will have different factors to be taken into account.  I will not set out the basis of our decision in writing to these customers.  In fact, it might not be helpful to them if I were to do so.  We work at the system-wide level and it is important that they seek their answers from the lender about the basis of that decision.<\/p> <p>  I did not mean to observe anything other than the fact that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has a set of statutory bases upon which it can make a decision.  I do not recall them now, but they are entirely different from ours.  Many parts of the system have different roles and they work differently but in complement with each other.  My point is no more or less than that.<\/p> <p>  The Stop the Harm approach is a protective approach we use.  I am glad the Deputy thinks it is a good idea.  We think so as well.  It is a filter that must be applied whereby when a decision is being taken about whether somebody is affected, one takes care not to make things worse for the person until that decision has been made.  If one decides that the person is affected, one keeps making sure that one does not make things worse for the person, but if one is sure that one's decision is that they are not affected, one has discharged one's obligation to apply that principle.  From our perspective, the Stop the Harm principles have been applied in this context because the decision from where we sit at present is that we have no further basis to challenge for those customers.  I understand that they are disappointed with that outcome.<\/p> <p>  There were 2 million accounts put into this.

I cannot get into discussing specifics as it is a matter for Bank of Ireland to discuss that with the individuals, but there are cases where there is no customer facing information, where no promise of a tracker was made, where there is no promise of a tracker in terms of the contract and there is no basis upon which the Central Bank can legitimately push for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I have a second question on the Central Bank's regulatory role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#Q00900","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":912,"content":"<p>We want to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#Q01000","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":913,"content":"<p>This is very brief and, again, the Central Bank is free to send correspondence to the committee.

An observation was made, which stands true, that a common set of incentives operated in the external environment which had clear pathways if anyone thought about it for half a second.  It was a time of significant financial crisis.  The tracker mortgage product was expensive for lenders.  It also turned out to be a very good product for customers.  That was not always the case, as the Senator knows, because we saw the complicated switching journeys of Irish customers as a feature of what happened.  My message to all customers today would be to switch and shop around for themselves to get the best products.  It was present in the market at that time.  The tracker was sometimes expensive compared with other options.  Later, as the products began to be withdrawn, it seems that it began to be expensive for lenders.  There was a common set of external circumstances which, if one took a tiny amount of time to think about them, had an obvious answer.<\/p> <p>  Ms McEvoy might comment on a feature of what happened then that I never expect to see again.  That was that these products were taken off the market and no real consideration was given to existing customers who might have choicer options that were good for them and that it was all one-way thinking, which might be about the financial situation of the lender and not about the duty owed to the customers.  That is precisely the kind of thing that we have said is different now.  We have a requirement, known as product oversight and governance, POG, which means that before a product is designed, approved, launched and sold, it must be clear whether it is appropriate and suitable for customers and what benefit it will give them.  Proper consumer thinking has to be at the heart of the design and there has to be an approval system in the organisation.  One has to think, when withdrawing a product from the market, about what existing customers are entitled to.  One cannot just take it away and forget about the obligation to existing customers.  The Senator made a wise observation about the system.  The improvement in the procedural framework that is required should deal with the idea of taking away a product without thinking about obligations to customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019102400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Historically, commercial institutions too often looked at products solely through the lens of profitability and how to make money out of a product.

From the paperwork he accumulated through freedom of information processes, it is clear that this man has been wronged in the process relating to tracker mortgages and there is a repossession order against his house on the basis of documentation that is incomplete.  The attitude of Bank of Ireland is to say to the person that he should not write to it again and the matter has been dealt with.  The attitude is one of stonewalling and preventing an individual going to the nth degree to defend his home on the basis of his belief that he is right.  He is a lay litigant against a raft of well-paid barristers and solicitors.  The bank has not demonstrated a customer-friendly approach and when it entered into an independent review of the case, it was conducted by the bank.

The system works.  These are called pre-approval control functions.  There is a requirement to get the permission of the Central Bank before a person can take up certain very senior roles in various companies.  One can decide one would like to hire a person, but one cannot hire him or her until the person has undergone the Central Bank's stop-and-check test and the bank is satisfied that the person is competent, capable and has the requisite integrity, which is really important.  We might have a concern and we expect that concern to be answered, because we have lots of sources of information, either because the person has already been working in the system or we get information from other regulators, the newspapers, Oireachtas committees or any source of information through our enforcement investigations.  We then hold what we call a challenge interview.  The person will be clear that we have concerns as we will have told the person what they are about.  The process is private.  We get ready to challenge the candidates.  Some people come up and attend the interview and they are surprised we are so ready for them because we will have transcripts of previous issues and we will put documentation to them.  Some people get so concerned that before or after the interview they withdraw the application and they do not allow it to go to a decision because it is a very serious thing for a negative decision to be in place against one as a senior person.

TWN is an organisation that was founded in 1996 by a group of women from all backgrounds in education, business and community whose vision was that all women should have access to and be encouraged to seek and take up education, training, development and business opportunities that would help and promote their role in society.<\/p> <p>  In 1996, TWN became a sectoral partner and then an intermediary funding body distributing money from the newly established PEACE programmes agreed by the European Union.  Over a six-year period, TWN built partnerships with other organisations in the voluntary community sector and distributed more than &euro;19 million across Northern Ireland and the Border counties to projects, all promoting women into education, training, employment and self-employment.  Over the years, TWN has moved from the delivery of money to applying as a project while still maintaining its partnership approach and ethos.  This has allowed TWN to share money from Europe through both the PEACE and Building Sustainable Prosperity-European Social Fund programmes with like-minded organisations.  It has also created a mechanism for the filtering of moneys down to women in Northern Ireland and the Border counties who promoted our aims but could never have applied to these programmes directly.<\/p> <p>  TWN has over the years established itself as Northern Ireland's premier women's network, with members ranging from individual women encompassing all ages to community groups and even private organisations and businesses.  What makes TWN so different is that it has male staff members as well as female and it actively works with males who work with women, helping it to promote the cause of women in education, training development, further education, employment or self-employment, which makes us somewhat unique.  It is important that men be part of the solution in redressing the imbalance and barriers women face in society.  TWN has been responsible for the research and publication of the role of women across a wide spectrum of issues such as the victims sector, women in non-traditional roles, ethnic minority women, the role of ordinary women in the First World War, perceptions and attitudes of radical extremism, and women in politics.  These are but a few of the research publications we have disseminated to date.<\/p> <p>  TWN is also one of only three organisations in Northern Ireland that hold consultative status with the United Nations, a role that we take seriously and contribute to regularly.  In fact, we managed to take 30 women from Northern Ireland to the 63rd Session of the Commission on the Status of Women in March of this year where they made an amazing contribution to the work being carried out, putting Northern Ireland women firmly on the map through their contribution to both the parallel and side events.  TWN is a lobbying body but is careful to keep its focus on its remit of promoting women in education, training, employment and self-employment.  At times, this has been difficult because we have had to take on Departments, Ministers, MLAs and anyone else who has tried to sideline women.  TWN has been in situations where its staff and partner organisations have been starved of their funding, forcing many people to do without wages or live on reduced wages, facing great uncertainty from week to week.  Indeed it was a very bleak time for us, just over two years ago, which we only came through due to the staff's dedication to the work the organisation undertakes.  I thank God that those days are behind us at the minute, but the voluntary sector is never very far from financial starvation.<\/p> <p>  TWN, like many organisations across Northern Ireland, is very dependent on European moneys, and at present with Brexit we are very concerned as to what happens next.  TWN prides itself on working with people in partnership and not making assumptions that the organisation knows what is needed in areas but rather works to provide adequate resources to particular organisations that are best placed to determine what is needed in their community.  This partnership approach makes TWN proud to say that it has built up excellent relationships with many organisations, not only in Northern Ireland and Ireland but throughout the UK, EU and internationally.  TWN has a staff complement of 12 people and an incredibly supportive board of directors coming from a wide background of knowledge and experience in the women's sector.  Indeed, TWN's chairperson, Patricia Lewsley-Mooney, is a former MLA and Northern Ireland children's commissioner.  TWN's work and research has given it a unique insight into the needs of women and has often helped it in seeking funding to bridge these identified gaps and help women move forward.<\/p> <p>  TWN has also been able to develop training where gaps exist or are non-existent.  For example, transgender awareness for employers was developed with members from the community and is offered right across Northern Ireland.  TWN also offers various European recognised accredited training courses on a wide range of subjects, which again helps in advancing and building CVs for women in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  While I could spend the whole day talking to members about TWN, I am aware of the time constraints.  Therefore, I would like to talk briefly about three of our programmes, finishing up with the challenges that I believe TWN and the women we work with are facing or are going to face in the future, not only from Brexit but from the ongoing lack of government, uncertainty around funding, and polarisation of communities.<\/p> <p>  The first project is the Promote, Advance and Support for Success, PASS, project.  This project is funded under the Northern Ireland European Social Fund programme.  It is aimed at some of the most marginalised young women in society.  The project targets women aged between 16 and 24 years, who are not in education, employment or training, NEET, and who are in eight communities across Northern Ireland.  The programme offers level 1 training and development to encourage young women back into education or employment. The project targets 204 young women per year and is a four-year project, of which we are now in the latter half of the second year.  Many of these young women face multiple barriers.  Often they have young children, are single parents, and have numeracy and literacy problems, prescription drug addictions and little or no family support.  This project offers hope and help to steer the young women onto a different path.  It has not been easy, recruitment has been slow, and the young women have been very unpredictable, but we are on target and have received good support from the Department for the Economy.  However, we also struggle to find the match-funding required under this measure.  Yet the successes have been phenomenal with many participants getting jobs and some going on to further training.  One example of this is that several of the young women who completed the level 1 have gone on to further training to become personal trainers.<\/p> <p>  TWN's peace and conflict transformation project, PACT, supported by the European Union's PEACE IV programme and managed by the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, is a collaboration with three partners: Foyle Women's Information Network, FWIN, in Derry-Londonderry, Intercomm in Belfast, and Queen's University Belfast, which helped develop the pioneering psychometric questionnaire testing.  This project is aimed at 1,200 women throughout Northern Ireland and the Border counties undertaking psychometric testing that then points them on to further individualised bespoke training provided by FWIN or Intercomm.  Again, early indication has shown excellent success and created interest in the concept of psychometric testing across various groupings and even among some of our statutory partners.<\/p> <p>  While this is only a snapshot of what we do, the final piece of work that we are leading is the women in community transformation programme, WICT.  This programme is funded through the Department for Communities and is just one of the 43 measures identified in the Fresh Start initiative.  It is perhaps the most challenging but rewarding work that we have done to date.  We are working in partnership with three others: Co-Operation Ireland, FWIN and Intercomm.  We are working with women across 26 locations in communities that have high levels of paramilitary control and coercion.  These women, many of whom are very brave, want to move forward in a Northern Ireland that is free from paramilitary control.<\/p><p>They want peace and prosperity for their children and families, not fear, coercion and control.  Our mantra, \"educate a woman, you educate a family, you educate a community\", ties in with the aims and objectives of the WICT programme.<\/p><p> We must make no mistake that while we have the Good Friday Agreement and peace it is not a perfect peace.  Faceless people remain in the shadows ready to exploit any weaknesses or fill any voids in the community to further their aims and bring us back to the dark days of violence and separation.  There is a marked upsurge in violence and fear in many of the areas in which we work.  Women are at the front line trying to keep their children safe, often while surviving in areas of high deprivation, poverty and isolation.<\/p><p> Brexit has taken a terrible toll on our communities and has the potential to cause even further polarisation and become an orange and green or an us and them issue.  We cannot let this happen.  TWN works tirelessly to help and empower women to face these challenges, often in dangerous and frightening ways that few of us could comprehend.  Many Protestants voted to remain and feel unrepresented.  In honesty, I believe they are frightened about their future and their voices are not being heard.  Any void in our fragile peace could be quickly filled by those who seek to return us to violence and segregation.<\/p><p> Women in nationalist and republican areas also fear the upsurge in dissident violence and control.  Again, this is not a threat we can ignore and pretend is not happening.  Our young people, and more increasingly young women, are susceptible to being sucked in.  In areas where little or no hope exists for a future they are sold an alternative that can offer standing and respect despite the end game.<\/p><p> This project offers these women hope, but it needs verbal and financial support.  Organisations such as ours need the political will and support of our politicians, not only in Northern Ireland but in the South of Ireland, the UK, Europe and beyond.  The future for us is uncertain as an organisation and as a community.  We face restricted and decreased funding for the work we do.  We face increased violence and the polarisation of the communities we work with, moving further away from each other than at any time in the past 20 years.<\/p><p> The growth in using and dealing prescription drugs is higher in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the UK and GPs struggle to cope with the growing numbers of people managing chronic pain versus addiction.  The voices of women are not heard and sectors such as victims of the violence, many of whom were women, are not being listened to.  We must address the past before we can move forward, no matter how painful that could be.  There is no political leadership or joined-up approaches from our politicians for all our citizens and the language we use must change.  Not everything in Northern Ireland is sectarian and not everything can be 50:50.  We grapple with fear, anger and mistrust, which we have spent decades trying to break down.  The uncertainty of Europe and Brexit is phenomenal for both communities.  I highlighted this earlier and it cannot be underestimated.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and his colleagues for allowing me to speak to them not only about TWN, about which I am so passionate and extremely proud, but about the amazing women I meet daily who remind me of what I do and why I do it.  We in Northern Ireland are unique.  We have so much to offer, not only internally on the island of Ireland but to the world.  I am proud of what we have achieved and I hope we will continue to achieve well into the future.  Despite the hurdles and obstacles that are put in our way, women are a force to be reckoned with.  We will not and cannot be returned to the box but must be encouraged to grow, develop and achieve the equality we deserve.  I now ask the committee to listen to some of my colleagues' experiences as women in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019102400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Norma Shearer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>Because of the sensitivity involved in many of the issues that will be raised I propose that we continue the meeting in private session to hear the evidence of the group that has come in.

I am assistant secretary for the housing policy, legislation and governance division of the Department.  I am joined by Mr. Rory O'Leary and Ms Catherine Rawson from the approved housing body, AHB, policy and regulation unit within this division.  I intend to keep my opening remarks brief in order to dedicate as much time as possible to addressing questions members may have on the Bill.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that this Bill has been in development for a significant period, and it is welcome that is has now been advanced to this point.  In September 2015, the then Government gave its approval to the drafting of the Bill.  Pre-legislative scrutiny was undertaken in December 2015 and the report of the committee was laid before the Oireachtas in February 2016.  The Bill was published in July this year and Second Stage was completed in the D&aacute;il on 25 September.<\/p> <p>  The Bill aims to safeguard public and private investment in the social housing provision sector, to enable increased supply from the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and to ensure that the assets built through investments are managed sustainably.  The statutory regulatory framework will provide further assurances to investors, tenants, the Government and to the sector itself that social housing providers operate in a well regulated and stable environment.  The Bill intends to establish an independent regulator to oversee the effective governance, financial management and performance of AHBs.  The regulator will be responsible for approving and registering housing bodies and the setting of regulatory standards.  The Bill provides for powers to the regulator in respect of the undertaking of inquiries, investigations and assessments.  The regulator will also have enforcement powers.<\/p> <p>  Briefly, some of the functions of the regulator will be to establish and maintain a register of AHBs; prepare draft standards for approval by the Minister, publish the approved standards, and monitor and assess compliance by AHBs with the approved standards and with the legislation more generally; carry out investigations in accordance with the Bill; to protect the assets of AHBs and in certain circumstances to cancel their registration in accordance with Part 6. where appropriate; to encourage and facilitate the better governance, administration and management, including corporate governance and financial management, of AHBs by the provision of information and advice; with a view to promoting awareness and understanding, to make available to the public information about the operation of the legislative arrangements being introduced under the Bill; to collect information concerning AHBs for the purposes of the performance of the functions conferred on it by or under this Bill; and to publish such information (including statistical information) concerning AHBs as appropriate. <\/p> <p>  A limited number of Government amendments to the Bill are being considered.  These amendments are broadly technical in nature and relate to the substance of the Bill.  I hope this provides a helpful summary and we are happy to take questions and provide any additional clarification.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>My questions are about the standard setting function that is proposed and some other issues.<\/p><p>I was on the board of the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, for many years, and a very large number of its membership and approved housing bodies are very small-scale housing providers.  They are local providers of social housing responding very flexibly to local need, for example, to older people or people with disabilities.  The boards of those bodies are largely made up of volunteers.  Can we be reassured that the standards will reflect the scale of the approved housing body and be duly appropriate and proportionate to these very small-scale housing bodies, which we want to encourage, because they are extremely responsive to local need and we would want to see them flourishing as well as being compliant and so on?<\/p><p> Will regulation help or hinder approved housing bodies' ability to respond to the housing crisis where, according to the official figures, 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation, 3,840 of whom are children, and 72,000 households are on local authority waiting lists?  I would like to hear from Mr. Lemass on the flexibility being balanced with the regulatory requirements, particularly for small bodies.  Will there be fees for the regulation and, if they are going to be fees, will they be proportionate to the size of the approved housing body?  Will the standards be reflective of the type of housing?  There is a difference between general needs and special needs housing.  What are Mr. Lemass's thoughts on how to make those distinctions?<\/p><p> I suppose one of the questions I find very concerning is around the protections tenants will have if the regulator refuses to register or cancels the registration of an approved housing body.  Who in law will be that tenant's landlord?  That is an important question and clarification is needed.  Are the Minister's powers relating to the proposed regulator, as proposed in the Bill, in line with the powers of other regulators, for example, HIQA, or are they over and above what is envisaged for other regulators in the area?  Will the proposed regulator have any impact on the classification, the reclassification or the re-reclassification of approved housing bodies being on balance sheet, or attempts to change this?  <\/p><p> The proposed regulation of approved housing bodies is on top of an existing regulatory compliance regime for approved housing bodies, which is very demanding, particularly for small organisations.  These other regulatory regimes include those of the Residential Tenancies Board and the Charity Regulator and local authority requirements.  Today, for example, we saw a new circular in regard to the capital assistance scheme, CAS, the Housing Finance Agency, Companies House and HIQA.  Will the requirements of the approved housing body be mindful of these other requirements and pressures?  Will there be any functions for the regulator in streamlining all the regulatory requirements for approved housing bodies, because that is an awful lot of regulation?  I am very supportive of regulation, but it needs to be proportionate and manageable, particularly in the case of small bodies, and they need to be able to continue to operate and flourish.<\/p><p> What is the proposed timescale for the approved housing body regulation coming on stream?

I will try to take them as much as possible in the order that they were asked but there might be a bit of an overlap.  On the question of standards, the three broad areas of standards that are currently in operation in the voluntary system are a governance standard, a financial standard and a performance standard, and the provisions of the Bill provide for the regulator to adopt new standards, which frankly I would expect to be broadly in line.  The fact that we have had a voluntary system for five years means that there would be a very gradual transition from where we are now to a statutory system.<\/p> <p>  The way we deal with the individual AHBs is that they are classified according to three tiers, where tier three is the largest 19, tier two is the mid-ranking ones and tier one is the smaller ones.  At present, the compliance requirements of the voluntary system are graduated.  The more money, the more growth plans one has, the more the compliance burden is on one.  The Bill provides that one can treat different categories or groupings in a similar manner, so there is an intention that smaller AHBs will not have the same burden as the larger ones in terms of the performance, financial and governance standards. <\/p> <p>  On the ability to respond, it is absolutely our intention that this regulation will enhance the sector's ability to respond.  The experience would show that well-regulated sectors attract investment more easily and there is generally a higher level of public confidence when a sector is well regulated.  The sector is already responding very well to the housing challenge, and the expectation is that it will do more and more.<\/p> <p>  As regards the provision of fees, we have one or two amendments in development around section 35(5), where we would propose, subject to the Minister's approval, to delete the provision for an annual registration fee that is contained therein.

Part of them are around where somebody requests a report and where there might be a cost associated with producing a report and putting a fee on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>So there will be no registration fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>The proposal is to delete section 35(5).

There is a provision for funding from the Government for the regulator, so we are satisfied that the operation is funded adequately.<\/p> <p>  On standards regarding types of housing, I would have to come back to Senator Kelleher on the precise standards for different types of housing, including housing for older people.  I would imagine that much of that is covered by building standards more than necessarily by the regulation of AHBs, but I will undertake to come back to Senator Kelleher on that.<\/p> <p>  On the question of tenant protections if the regulator cancels an AHB, there is a provision in the legislation that the regulator would seek to transfer assets, ideally by consent, if an AHB feels that it wants to secure its legacy through transfer, and I know the ICSH has been active with certain AHBs on this.  Consent would be an ideal way where someone recognises their time in this area has come to an end and they want to transfer.  If there is a concern regarding the performance of an AHB, and the regulator feels that it is necessary to transfer assets, there is an obligation to go through High Court procedures to make that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>Could we be reassured that they will stay within the approved housing bodies rather than transferred out to say, for example, a private provider?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>The provision in the Bill is either for another registered approved housing body or a housing authority, which would be a local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D00800","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>Those are the two that are provided for.<\/p> <p>  On the question of other regulators, we accept that it is a crowded regulatory space, and what it is going to require is memoranda of understanding, which are also provided for in the Bill, to enable the AHB regulator work with HIQA, the RTB and others to make sure that they are not stepping over each other's areas.  By way of example, the RTB is very clear what areas of tenancy-landlord relationships are governed by the RTB legislation, and the AHB regulator would be very clear that it did not have a role in that.  Memoranda of understanding would be the way to proceed, and that is the clear expectation and it is provided for in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the impact of this on reclassification, to be clear, this Bill is about the regulation to protect tenancies and to protect assets.  Reclassification is a separate accounting exercise.  However, this issue has been discussed at length in the interim regulatory committee, and the view of that committee, of which I am a member, is that there is nothing in this which would hinder reclassification, and indeed, it would probably strengthen reclassification to be able to say that we have a well-regulated sector on a statutory basis.<\/p> <p>  The timescale for legislation is more in the committee's hands than in ours, but we would be very keen to get this legislation adopted as quickly as possible.  It is in gestation now for four or five years.  We would hope to get this through before Christmas, but we are in the committee's hands on that.<\/p> <p>  On how to prepare, in general AHBs have been very good.  They have engaged with the voluntary regulator, and they have worked to comply with the standards.  I think we only have 11 AHBs which are working through an engagement process, and all of the others that have registered with the regulator are in a satisfactory assessment.  Obviously, for those which have not registered with the regulator, we prefer if they registered, but once the legislation is enacted, they are all deemed to be registered - all 500 plus of them and not just the ones that are co-operating with the voluntary code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Lemass.  I call Deputy O'Brien.<\/p><p>On his last point, is Mr. Lemass saying the 500 plus will all be deemed registered on the date, whether they have actually engaged or not?  I have a more general question.  I have heard before at a committee that there is a breakdown of the AHBs.  Mr. Lemass mentioned, in response to Senator Kelleher, a type of tiered regulation, along the lines of the Financial Regulator, where insurance brokers have a tiered regulation based on their size.  Has Mr. Lemass looked at that?  Is he giving a different category of approval, for want of a better phrase?  We have AHBs which do not have properties.  They are not paper AHBs but how are we going to deal with them?<br\/><br\/>I would support Mr. Lemass in trying to bring this legislation in as promptly as possible.  The timeframe he gave was before Christmas, and I welcome that.  When is he looking to publish the Government amendments and what type of data is he looking at in terms of bringing it to Committee Stage?  Mr. Lemass might have a look at that.<br\/><br\/>I want to ask about the appointment of the board.  The board of members will consist of between five and 11 members.  I have looked through the explanatory memorandum.  In regard to the type of people who will be appointed, it says they are all ministerial appointees.  From what sectors will they be drawn?  I am particularly thinking of tenant advocates or tenants themselves, or a tenant representative.  Has that been thought about?<br\/><br\/>I refer to the disability sector, which is crucially important.  The committee has heard about the difficulties people with disabilities have in accessing housing and the longer waiting times.  There has been a good initiative at local authority level in relation to the housing disability committees - the implementation committees in local authorities.  Not all of them have yet met.  We asked for an update on that to see how the local authorities are getting on.  Maybe Mr. Lemass could enlighten us on the thinking in the Department on which sectors would form part of that board to make sure it is representative of the sector and those who are living in approved housing bodies.  That is the main area.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the inspection, appointing inspectors, standards and that type of thing.  Does Mr. Lemass see any type of interaction with the RTB or the local authorities?  There may be an issue with standards and the regulator will have the right to appoint inspectors.  Who will those inspectors be?  Would Mr. Lemass see that as being the local authorities or what is the view there?<br\/><br\/>A very basic question is on whether we have gone down the line in relation to resourcing.  We know the number of board members.  The regulator will appoint the chief executive.  What type of resources will the office have staff-wise?  I know it will be organic and will grow with the sector, but does Mr. Lemass have an initial plan and an initial cost?  With the establishment of the office and as it moves into this area, do we have an idea of the cost of this?<br\/><br\/>I assume the regulator would fall under this committee and that there would be no restrictions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>parliamentary questions, freedom of information, FOI, and all those types of things should Deputies and Senators wish to engage because AHBs are becoming a larger part of our housing sector and will continue to grow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#D01000","speaker":"1304","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Deputy O'Brien.

It will fall to the regulator to set up what the new assessment code is, but my expectation would be that there will not be a different marking, shall we say, for tiers one, two and three, if that is what they opt for.  I would be surprised if they did not go for something similar, so one will either be satisfactory or not, regardless of whether one is tier one, two or three or whether one has no properties or lots of properties.  I would expect that that would be the case, but obviously the first thing the regulator will need to do is adopt standards, codes and policies in areas like that.

I am interested to know more of the thinking behind how the Bill is framed at the moment.  I suggest that Mr. Lemass might think through some of the issues between now and when amendments are tabled because I am not so sure technical amendments will deal with some of them.<\/p> <p>  We talked the last time about section 38 and in particular the issues around tenancy management and nominations and allocations.  When we met the last time, I asked whether there was any kind of regulatory conflict or overlap between the Residential Tenancies Board and the AHB regulator.  On the basis of Mr. Lemass's answers, I am satisfied that there is not; they are quite distinct.<\/p><p>I am concerned, however, that the Department and the local authorities currently take that responsibility in terms of ensuring that Government policy is properly adhered to.  I am interested to hear more about the thinking behind giving those functions to the regulator and how that relates to the roles as they are currently constituted by the Department and by local authorities in their engagement with the AHBs.<\/p><p> The second point is the really big one and it relates to section 54.  I urge committee members to think about this one quite carefully.  I hear what Mr. Lemass said about the transfer of dwellings being voluntary.  As Senator Kelleher outlined, however, we have a very large number of very small tier 1 AHBs, often involving only a handful of properties.  Many of those have voluntary boards and over the next ten to 20 years it is highly likely that they will start to drift away due to age of members and so on.  One could have a situation where significant numbers of properties fall under the radar with the regulator at a particular point.  Who will look after those properties in the future?<\/p><p> This also gives rise to the question of a proper resolution process with a proper fund.  I raised this matter previously.  When certain banking legislation was being debated during the lifetime of the previous Oireachtas, an issue arose in the context of the resolution of credit unions that were in difficulties.  There is quite an elaborate process in the legislation to work out what one does with an entity and its assets when its board is no longer in a position to adequately manage them.  This also includes a fund, because if we are to transfer properties - either to another AHB or a local authority - who will cover the costs, what happens if there is significant cyclical maintenance that needs to be done and what happens if there is no sinking fund?  These are not small matters.  I say this because in my constituency we had a significant case where relatively new properties had to be handed back to the local authority.  This was through no fault of the AHB that was managing them, it was more to do with building control failures.  It was a significant volume of units.  The remediation of those properties has led to a huge increased cost to the local authority, which is not getting any extra money.  This has already happened.  While I am not opposed to this aspect of the Bill, I am of the view that the process needs to be there and that we need a proper resolution and a processing fund.  I am interested to hear our guests' thoughts on that.<\/p><p> A more general comment relates to section 47.  It is about the kind of language that sets the bar against which the regulator can carry out investigations and so on.  The kind of language to which I refer is \"Where the Regulator considers it is necessary\".  In other legislation, it is usually where the regulator has \"reasonable suspicion\".  This is important because we are talking about the reputation of not-for-profit organisations.  The Department needs to look at that language.  I am not in any way trying to prevent the regulator from going in.  If the regulator has suspicions, then it should go in quickly.  However, phrases such as \"considers it necessary\" or \"is of the opinion\" set a much lower bar.  I urge the Department to consider that or to explain why it has chosen this wording.<\/p><p> Section 48 refers to interim reports.  If I read the Bill correctly, the regulator can publish an interim report without an AHB having been given a copy of that report or an opportunity to respond.  An interim report could have a series of serious issues around governance, management or so on.  It could affect the reputation of the AHB or the managers.  Again, I am not trying to stifle the publication of reports but if a report is to be published the individuals and the organisation to whom it refers should have sight of the report and an opportunity to respond.  Correct me if I am wrong, but that is not the case with these proposed interim reports.<\/p><p> I am very glad to hear about the fees, and I hope the Minister accepts them.  It is clear that a person should pay a fee for a service.  For example, fees for reports are fine, and I welcome that.<\/p><p> I have two general questions.  I hear what Mr. Lemass has said about the reclassification.  Has there been any engagement, even an informal engagement, with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, or is such an engagement even permissible?  While the group that Mr. Lemass sits on might have a view, ultimately the CSO has the expertise in this area.  I am interested to know whether or not there was any engagement with the CSO.  In the past, the Government has tried to get things off the balance sheet or off the books, and that failed because it is a complex process.  Perhaps our guests could offer some reassurance in respect of that matter.<\/p><p> I also wish to follow up on a point made by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I would like the legislation to be very explicit that all appointments for the regulator and the board are made through the Public Appointments Service process.  The legislation does not currently say this.  During a previous appearance before the committee, Mr. Lemass stated that it would be the intention to do that in any event.  I would much prefer it to be in the legislation, because then a Minister does not have the option of bypassing the Public Appointments Service.  I strongly support Deputy Darragh O'Brien in this regard.<\/p><p> The legislation could go a little bit further.  Consider, for example, the Construction Instruction Register Ireland.  The heads of the Bill, if not the Bill, stipulate different categories of expertise the Government would like to see on the board.  Stipulating categories of expertise could be a very valuable aspect, disability being an obvious one and tenants advocates being another.  Without wanting to give the Department too much work - I want to see this legislation through as quickly as possible - that kind of approach could make the board much more robust, which would serve everybody better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#E01300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I hope it will not take too long.  I welcome Mr. Lemass and thank him for his concise presentation.<\/p> <p>  I want to set the context for my questions.  In September, we heard that more than &euro;2 billion in Government funding had been given to unregulated bodies to provide for social housing over the past ten years.  That money went to a variety of co-operatives, associations, charities and other non-profit groups clustered under the heading of AHBs.  That was stated at our previous engagement here.  Despite the great sums of money and substantial contribution of the AHBs to social housing provision, providing 40% of all new social housing in the country last year, they still have no statutory basis for their operation.  If Mr. Lemass wants to dispute that, I am happy to take it on board but those are the figures.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the legislation; it is really important.  It is long overdue and we have had a lot of discussion about it.  Between 2009 and 2018, the AHBs received &euro;1.745 billion in funding directly from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or channelled through the local authorities.  To date this year, they have received &euro;260 million in capital funding and &euro;210 million for current spending.  Those are the figures.  I have researched and checked them with the Department.  I acknowledge the vastness of this thing.  It is hard to believe that these AHBs to date have had no strong regulation.  The legislation is therefore welcome.  Mr. Lemass might pass on a personal view of mine to the effect that the Minister might consider initiating this legislation in the Seanad if possible.  It is open to the Minister.  I understand that people are keen to get on with the legislation.  Any legislation can be initiated in either House.  The Seanad is not sitting today but I am sure it would welcome the opportunity.  I have spoken to the Minister about initiating other legislation in the Seanad and he has said he is mindful of and open to the idea, subject to timescales and other considerations within his Department.  I ask Mr. Lemass to bring my request to the Minister's attention that he might consider it.  It is ultimately a matter for the Minister and I fully respect that.<\/p> <p>  What happens in the case of insolvency or examinership in the context of an AHB?  We know there have been some complications in examinership and insolvency issues regarding AHBs in the past.  This is not a new scenario.  Mr. Lemass will be familiar with it.  Could he outline the grounds on which the regulator can cancel the registration of an AHB?  There are going to be knock-on effects of that.  Senator Kelleher touched on the issue of what happens to dwellings where an AHB registration is cancelled.  There are significant concerns for residents and many implications for ongoing management.  There may be reluctance on the part of other AHBs or local authorities to take on such dwellings, particularly if there is a complex legal matter involved or if there are major issues around the governance of the outgoing AHB.  Not everyone will be queueing up to take these on.  There are some serious concerns about AHBs.<\/p> <p>  There is clearly a need for a protocol between AHBs and the Department and, more importantly, the local authorities, which are the statutory housing authorities.  I understand a draft protocol was being worked on and that some of the bigger AHBs were keen to see one.  Inevitably, there are conflicts and in the past there was a lot of unnecessary and uncalled for competition and comparison regarding the delivery of AHBs versus that of local authorities, how they raise funding and the different mechanisms used.  There has been a great deal of concern on the part of elected members in particular about feeling isolated or not fully versed in what AHBs are doing within their local authority areas.  That is not to say that local authorities should have a veto over AHB work but there needs to be good working relationships between the housing authority, the AHBs and the general sector dealing with the provision of housing under the AHB system.  I understand that the heads of some sort of protocol were drawn up.  Mr. Lemass may not know about it but he might undertake to look into it and bring back a memo or report to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#G01100","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman.  The first thing to say is that we would see that the sector is regulated at the moment but it is done on a voluntary basis.  We would consider that the voluntary regulation has been very effective.  It has established standards for finance, governance and performance and it has withheld approval from that assessment process for a range of AHBs.  That has directly led to improved performance and compliance by AHBs.  I would argue strongly that the voluntary system has worked quite well at getting AHBs aware of the need to be compliant and of, frankly, upping their game in order that the transition to a statutory system will not be such a leap.  In many ways, we can treat it as a virtue that, having had this Bill rocking around for four or five years, we have a voluntary scheme in place that has upped the game of AHBs consistently over the past four years to the point that only 11 are still in engagement and awaiting a satisfactory outcome out of the 260 or so that are registered under the voluntary code.  It is important to recognise that it is not an unregulated sector.<\/p><p>The regulations are not on a statutory basis, but there is a voluntary system that is working very well.  That voluntary system also informs funding through a circular from the Department which talks about the need for a satisfactory assessment.

Frankly, I would be surprised if the regulator was not aware of the financial challenges facing an AHB before it reached the stage of examinership.  There is a quite strong level of engagement with AHBs.<\/p> <p>  Regarding dwellings whose registration is cancelled, the ideal scenario would be a voluntary transition.  The goal of the regulation is to protect the tenants and the assets.  Ideally, there will be a voluntary transition in which an AHB recognises that for whatever reason its board is unable to comply and wants to move on, for example, if it is aged.  There have been voluntary transitions from AHBs, transfers of assets and mergers of AHBs.  It has happened, although perhaps not at the pace we would like.  Obviously, this would not happen overnight and would be planned in advance.  Given its understanding of the sector, part of the regulator's role would be to identify alternative AHBs, or possibly a local authority, which would take on the units.  That would have to be done on a case-by-case basis, as would the consideration of the condition of the units.<\/p> <p>  We will undertake to check what protocol is in place or is being developed for engagement between housing authorities and AHBs.

As Senator Boyhan outlined, considerable public funds are allocated to AHBs for the provision of valuable assets, that is, houses.  What measures are in place to ensure that voluntary boards are making allocations according to the overall housing policies of the relevant local authorities?  What measures ensure that members of voluntary boards do not allocate housing to their cousins, to people they know or for other improper reasons?

We can have as many regulations as we want, but they do not work unless they are implemented fully.  The biggest issue I see for local authorities is staffing.  The timeframe for applying to go on the local authority housing list is so long that I am currently working on a Bill to bring it down to three weeks.  I have been informed that the biggest issue is staffing.  It could become a serious issue.  That is unacceptable.  Regulation and its effects are very important.  I deal with a lot of AHBs.  They are registered charities.  As such, they are subject to regulations.  The local authorities seems to be taking this road.  They are not building any more.  I have a massive grievance with local authorities for that reason.  For the last 100 years we built local authority houses.  We are not building on the same scale at all.  That is a problem.  I know of many AHBs that have done great work.  Their building has been absolutely excellent, second to none.  I can only praise them for their work.  They work with the local authorities.  Senator Kelleher asked a related question.  I find from working with AHBs that most of their work is done with the local authority.  When they are actually allocating the houses, they give every power to the local authority.  That needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  There are so many staffing issues facing local authorities.  We have great staff, by the way.  I am not criticising the staff that are there.  However, local authorities have become so understaffed that it has become a huge problem.  This could cause problems for local authorities.  We must achieve a balance.  If this is done right, the local authorities get their share of it while working with the Department.  Unless we can achieve that balance, I will be quite concerned.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses believe that these regulations will have a better impact on people's lives and on the local authorities?  The AHBs state that they have a discretion of 15% on allocations that they can work on with local authorities.  I have never seen them use their 15%.  All the local authorities work with AHBs.  With regard to, for example, medical grounds or cases where we would be looking for housing, will they be given more of an input into deciding, which is a big issue for me, or will the Department say that they have to go 100% with local authorities?  At present, there is a discretion of 15%, whether it is Tuath Housing Association, Cl&uacute;id Housing or Respond Housing.<\/p><p> Like all members, I work with local authorities and in my clinics I deal with housing.  The new data protection has become a major issue when one is making representations for people to local authorities and even to an AHB about interviews or whatever.  One cannot get any information back because the councils say they no longer give names.  That is becoming a problem.  There must be a balance.  I can understand that one must have a consent form from the person for whom one has made the representations.  One gets the person to sign a form giving his or her consent to have representations made on his or her behalf.  There are many issues that have fallen through the cracks in the system.  Unless we start to put some sort of system in place for regulation, there are many inefficiencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#H02100","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571871600,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>Deputy Noel Rock resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>The Senator spoke a great deal about staffing in her first question, whether it is local authority staff or AHB staff.  My colleagues might confirm it, but I believe the AHBs in the voluntary code have approximately 10,000 staff.  There are many staff in the AHBs.  They might not all be involved in the provision of social housing.  In many cases, they have a broader remit.  However, there are a number of staff involved with the AHBs.

It started in the House in 2015.  Everybody here welcomes the legislation and agrees that it is necessary.  Most of my questions have been asked.  Some of the issues are concerns more than anything else with regard to regulation and the smaller approved housing bodies.  Initially approved housing bodies were established to deal with vulnerable people in society.  Now they are providing mainstream social housing.  I welcome the comment that some of the legislation is proportional.  There are three tiers of AHBs so perhaps the regulation will tie into the different tier strands.<\/p> <p>  I welcome this regulation and am not questioning it, but I must return to the on and off balance sheet problem the State has.  AHBs remain on balance sheet.<\/p><p>They will not be able to deliver the capacity of housing that is needed until we get them off balance sheet.  Therefore, it may as well be a local authority if it is on balance sheet.  I wonder if some of this regulation could be applied to local authority housing as well.  It would be useful if the Department would comment on that.<\/p><p> The witnesses mentioned nominations and allocations and they said it is within the regulation and the local authority still has an input.  I know this is an issue that brings us back to the question of being on balance sheet or off balance sheet again.  These were more of the criteria that had an impact in driving the approved housing bodies on balance sheet.  Does the Department foresee that in the future the local authority would ever be removed from those nominations and allocations or that the local authority would be held to statute in that process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019102400002#J01700","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571871600,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the Deputy's comments.  The origins of the sector was initially related to vulnerable people but it is a much broader response now.  There are three tiers operating in the voluntary system.  I would be surprised if the statutory system does not follow something similar, if not identical.  They seem to be working well and it is proportionate to the size of the AHB.<\/p> <p>  On the question of capacity when it is on balance sheet, the national development plan out to 2027 envisages significant construction of social housing.  It is in the order of 11,000 to 12,000 houses per annum from 2021 to 2027, and that money is provided for in the national development plan.  That is a baseline that is already provided for in funding.  Thereafter, if there is a challenge in funding, it would be a matter for the Government to look at prioritisation and to ask if there are priorities for capital funding in another area or if it should go to housing.  We are working on the question of reclassification.  We met the Irish Council for Social Housing last week, we are due to meet the Housing Alliance in the next week or two and we have had engagement with the CSO, which is to answer Deputy &Oacute; Broin's earlier question.  We have had engagement with the CSO as recently as this week and we intend to meet it to see what the options are.<\/p> <p>  On the nominations process, the proposal on the table from the ICSH, and the Housing Alliance's proposal is broadly similar, is that by use of choice-based lettings, a clear distinction is made between the allocations and the nominations.  The allocations would come from a scheme for social housing support assessment, which local authorities do every year and which gives us the figure of 68,000 people on the housing waiting list, but the nominations to a unit would be done by the AHB.  The idea is the choice-based letting process would demonstrate an absence of control by the local authority on that process.  We are teasing through the various process steps.  I cannot see how we get away from having some form of social housing need assessment at present.  That generates a social housing list, which then feeds AHBs when they are drawing down funds through the various Government funding lines.  I cannot see a way out of that at present but let us continue to work on it and see what we can do about it.

We will come back to him on that.<br\/><br\/>We were on the question of the transfer of dwellings and the question of whether we would set up a fund in a similar way as was done with the credit unions.  We have a range of different funds in place such as CAS, CALF and the CLSS.  All of them include some form of a maintenance provision.  This regulation is about safeguarding assets and tenants.  On a case-by-case basis, there will be situations such as the one that arose in the Deputy's local authority.  It will happen.  Going the whole way to a fund would be broader than this legislation.  It would be a policy matter so we would need to work it through in that way, but I would hope that as part of any transfer of assets, due regard would be had to the houses themselves and to the broader access an AHB might have to funding or other facilities or assets that could be used to support maintenance.  That is as far as I would like to commit on it, other than to say that on a case-by-case basis it is something that could be looked at.<br\/><br\/>Deputy &Oacute; Broin also mentioned section 47 and the language used for investment.

Surely, if the regulator is going to instigate an investigation into an approved housing body because it has information or evidence to suggest there was a problem, it should be that the regulator should have reasonable suspicion rather than just being \"of the opinion\" on something, because that opinion could be determined by the regulator just sitting on his or her own and deciding to do this investigation.

However, there may be an unforeseen circumstance where information comes to light at short notice and it becomes necessary to launch an investigation immediately.  We have to rely on the good offices of the regulator to be proportionate and balanced in its use of the investigation instrument.

Acceptance of the amendment involves accordingly the deletion of section 2 of the Bill.  This approach to the amendment of section 2 was taken on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in view of the number and nature of the changes made to the section.<\/p><p>The great majority of the proposed amendments concern the form and not the substance of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  None of the individual amendments lessen or weaken in any way the protections contained in the Bill as initiated.  The amendments in fact significantly strengthen the protections provided for in the Bill.  As I have submitted a detailed briefing note to the select committee setting out the individual amendments made to section 2 and the reasons for them, I will now outline only the main amendments that are proposed.<\/p><p>There are three substantive additions to the Bill.  The first is the proposed prohibition in section 66B(7), as proposed in section 2, on contract terms that place a limit on the number of gift vouchers that can be used in a single transaction.  Where such a contract term applies, a consumer with two &euro;100 vouchers who wishes to purchase goods or services for &euro;200 from the business that issued the voucher would be permitted to use only one of the vouchers.  A contract term of this kind is unfair and unjustified.<\/p><p>The second addition provides in section 66B(8), as proposed in section 2, that where a gift voucher contract provides for the replacement of a lost or stolen voucher, the replacement voucher should have the same expiry date as the original voucher.  This provision will protect consumers by ensuring that an original and a replacement gift voucher will be subject to a combined expiry period of not less than five years, while clarifying for businesses that a replacement voucher will not be treated as a new voucher for the purpose of the five-year expiry date requirement.<\/p><p>The third substantive addition provides in section 66B(10), as proposed in section 2, for an exception to the doctrine of privity of contract, which restricts rights and obligations under a contract to the parties to the contract.  As gift vouchers of their nature are normally redeemed by their recipients rather than their purchasers, it is necessary to ensure that the recipient of a voucher can exercise the same rights under the contract as its purchaser, including rights included in gift voucher contracts by this Bill.<\/p><p>A number of the proposed amendments have been made in response to legal advice that certain provisions of the Bill as initiated were at risk of legal challenge on the ground of incompatibility with the unfair commercial practices directive.  The legal advice recommended that in order to minimise the risk of legal challenge, provisions aimed at commercial practices by traders should be redrafted so that they were aimed instead at terms in gift voucher contracts.  This has been done in sections 66B(1), (4), (6) and (8), as proposed in section 2 of the Bill.<\/p><p>The great majority of the other amendments to the Bill are technical in nature.  The definition of \"gift voucher\" in section 66A(1), as proposed in section 2, has been amended to exclude a number of products such as prepaid telephone and Internet cards, gas and electricity cards, diesel and petrol cards, cheques and postal orders that share some characteristics with gift vouchers and might accordingly be held to come within the definition of that term, but to which the protections of the Bill are unnecessary or would be inappropriate.  Electronic money gift vouchers are also excluded from the scope of the Bill in response to legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General that its inclusion risked incompatibility with the maximum harmonisation nature of the electronic money directive, as well as conflict with the regulatory regime for electronic money.  The counterparty to the trader who supplies a gift voucher under a gift voucher contract is now referred to as a \"person\" rather than, as in the Bill as initiated, a \"consumer\", in recognition of the facts that many businesses purchase vouchers to give to their employees and that these employees would not be regarded as \"consumers\" under the definition of that term in consumer legislation.<\/p><p>Other technical amendments seek to clarify aspects of the application of the provisions to which they relate in order to avoid legal uncertainty and unintended consequences.  In section 66A(2)(a), as proposed in section 2, for example, the exclusion from the definition of \"gift voucher\" of vouchers redeemable for the purchase at a discounted price of specified goods or services for a period of limited duration now provides that this period should not exceed three months.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571871600,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571871600,"counter":1191,"content":"<p>Section 2 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571871600,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following: <br \/><br \/>&ldquo;<b>Consequential amendments to Act of 2007<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>3. <\/b>The Act of 2007 is amended&mdash;<blockquote>(a) in section 67, by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (d):<blockquote><blockquote>&lsquo;(d) any contravention of section 65(1) or section 66B,&rsquo;,<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>(b) in section 85(1), by the substitution of the following paragraphs for paragraph (d):<blockquote><blockquote>&lsquo;(d) Regulation 5(3), 7(8), 8(5), 9(4), 10(10), 11(6), 12(5), 19(7), 25(4), 26(5) or 27(4) of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I.

In my letter to the scope section, I explained why I believed I was an employee and not self-employed.  Within a week of my letter to the scope section, a group of vested interests met.  This group included representatives from the Department, the social welfare appeals office, IBEC, ICTU, the Department of Finance and Revenue.  Before any scope section investigation had begun, this group, which subsequently became known as the Employment Status Group, decided that no matter what evidence I presented, the<i>status quo <\/i>was to remain.  The <i>status quo<\/i>was a secret special tax agreement between the Department, Revenue and courier company employers which treated all couriers as PAYE employees yet labelled them as self-employed.  I call this State-approved and assisted misclassification of employees as self-employed gigification.<br\/><br\/>Gigification permits selected employers to evade PRSI obligations and employee rights obligations.  Gigification is always bogus self-employment but bogus self-employment is not always gigification.  The difference is the approval and assistance of the State in creating bogus self-employed workers.  Scope was deliberately sidelined.  It can take up to six years and costs up to &euro;1 million in legal fees for a worker to overturn a State-approved, default self-employment classification.<br\/><br\/>The Department grants illegal State aid in the form of a PRSI exemption to selected employers.  It is a tax break which puts compliant employers at a distinct economic disadvantage and denies employees all their rights as employees.  The misclassification of workers as self-employed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has one purpose - to save selected employers circa 30% on labour costs as an enticement to create jobs.  The mechanisms used by the Department and Revenue to knowingly circumvent applicable law are unlawful test cases.  That a number of these unlawful test cases exist was confirmed in writing by the social welfare appeals office, SWAO, on 9 January 2019.  A representative of that office confirmed that, on occasion over the years, an approach of having test cases has been taken or considered by the SWAO.  Only one of these precedential test cases has ever been revealed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. <br\/><br\/>That test cases are unlawful was acknowledged Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 25 March 2019 in an article in<i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which states: &quot;The Minister is also looking at changing legislation to permit deciding officers to make determinations on the employment status of groups or classes of workers.&quot;  This is a clear acknowledgement from the Minister that no legislation currently exists to justify determinations on the employment status of groups or classes of workers.<br\/><br\/>That test cases are unlawful is further confirmed in a letter dated 9 May 2019 from the Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Public Accounts Committee which states: &quot;There is no legislative provision which provides for Appeals Officers to make decisions on the employment status of groups or classes of workers who are engaged or operate on the same terms and conditions.&quot;<br\/><br\/>There are serious constitutional issues with making a decision affecting a group of people without proper procedures and safeguards.  There must be specific legislation to permit deciding officers to make determinations on the employment status of groups or classes of workers, which there is not.  This important legal tenet was confirmed in the High Court case of John Grace Fried Chicken Ltd &amp;amp; Others <i>v.<\/i>The Catering Joint Labour Committee &amp;amp; Others.<br\/><br\/>In September 2000, the Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee wrote to the Secretary General of the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and requested to know why all couriers were classified as self-employed by default by the Department.  Until September 2000, the Department had never recorded, suggested nor admitted that precedential test cases existed.  This letter from the Secretary General is the first recorded instance of the Department laying claim to a precedential test case.  In this letter the Secretary General states:<\/p><blockquote>A number of representative 'test cases' were selected in 1993\/94 for detailed investigation and formal insurability decision under social welfare legislation.  This process resulted in a decision by an Appeals Officer of the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 12 June 1995 who decided that a courier was self-employed.  The Appeals Officer's decision established the criteria in relation to the employment status of couriers that has, since then, been generally accepted throughout the industry and also by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.<\/blockquote> <p>The Secretary General listed these uniquely unlawful precedents as follows.  The first criterion was that the courier provided his or her own vehicle and equipment.  The second was that he or she was responsible for all expenses.  The third was that payment was made on the basis of rate per job plus mileage allowance.The Secretary General also stated: &quot;The Appeals Officer's decision established the criteria in relation to the employment status of couriers.&quot;<br\/><br\/>The scope section of the Department was present at this test case appeal on 12 June 1995.  Indeed, it was the scope section decision that a single courier was an employee and not self-employed which was being appealed to the social welfare appeals office.<br\/><br\/>On 11 April 2019, the scope section wrote that it had no knowledge of precedential test cases, including the case the Secretary General claimed was a test case in his letter to the Public Accounts Committee in 2000.  A scope deciding officer wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Please note I am not aware of any secret test case nor are any of my colleagues in the Scope Section.  This was news to me when Martin explained to me. <\/blockquote> <p>The scope section was the defendant in the 1995 appeal.  In the 24 years since the test case described by Secretary General, the scope section still has not been informed that the social welfare appeals office overturning of the scope section decision was actually a test case and, as such, if it were legal, should form part of its deliberations.  The test case does not form any part of deliberations of decisions by the scope section then or now.  <br\/><br\/>Workers appearing before the social welfare appeals office are not informed by the Department or the appeals office that the appeals office applies precedents which are not known to the scope section, the courts, the legal profession or any other legal or quasi-legal body of the State.  The use of secret precedential test cases by the social welfare appeals office leads to a situation where the social welfare appeals office makes appeal decisions on the same workers twice, once in their absence without the worker's knowledge or participation, and again should the worker seek to have their self-employed by default misclassification overturned. <br\/><br\/>In 2000, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee wrote to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and asked why all couriers were being treated as self-employed by the Revenue Commissioners.  In August 2000, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners replied:<\/p><blockquote>The issue of Couriers and particularly Motorcycle Couriers was the subject of protracted discussions between Revenue and Representatives of the Courier Industry.  I enclose copies of our letters of 7 March 1997 and 3 April 1997 to (Accountants) which represented Courier Companies at the discussions.  The letters outline the agreement reached for tax purposes.<\/blockquote> <p>This agreement treated couriers as employees under the PAYE system, with tax and PRSI deducted at source by their employer.  Couriers received payslips with the deductions and employer clearly identified.  The only difference between couriers and most other employees is that the PRSI class allowed to be deducted by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was class S, which is generally a self-employed class.  The courier companies were exempted from paying employers PRSI and also exempted from their statutory obligation to make a return on all courier paid in excess of IR&pound;3,000.<br\/><br\/>All past non-compliance was forgotten about.  The Revenue Commissioners did not agree with the courier companies, nor with the subsequent letter from the Secretary General, that the 1995 appeal hearing was a test case and went to very great lengths to explain why.<\/p><p>They stated:<\/p><blockquote>The decision is not binding on Revenue.  This arrangement does not override the statutory rights of couriers in this particular area for the future.  This arrangement should not be taken as a precedent in any other area of law, where the status of couriers may be a factor.  The matter, if relevant in the future, should be taken on its own merits. (Chief Inspector of Taxes, 7th March 1997).<\/blockquote><p>That this secret tax agreement between Revenue, the then-Department of Social Welfare and courier companies was unique, unprecedented and also unavailable to all other employers in all other industries was confirmed in writing by the Chief Inspector of Taxes in April 1997 when he wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Because of the special circumstances surrounding the couriers status for tax and social welfare purposes, the agreement governing couriers should not be taken as a precedent for other cases you may have with the Revenue Commissioners.<\/blockquote><p>A secret tax agreement which is not available to other companies, industries or employers and which exempts selected companies and industries from statutory obligations, including PRSI obligations, fits the criteria for illegal state aid.  This is particularly the case in construction where construction companies which enjoy the cover of this precedent of default self-employment worker classification have a competitive advantage companies which are forced to comply with their statutory obligations by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<br\/><br\/>While the Revenue Commissioners dismissed the courier companies' claim that the 1995 appeal hearing was a test case, they agreed to implement a default self-employed classification on couriers following years of lobbying from courier company representatives to treat all couriers as self-employed.  The Revenue Commissioners are clear and precise as to why they implemented this default self-employment classification of all couriers.  Their position is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>While the decision (1995 SWAO Hearing) is not binding on Revenue, I propose, as previously stated, in the interest of uniformity and with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion, to treat couriers as self-employed. (Chief Inspector of Taxes, April 1997).<\/blockquote><p>The Revenue Commissioners agreed to absolve courier companies of their non-compliance with statutory obligations and to implement a unique tax-evading special agreement with courier companies.  This was all done, in Revenue's own words, &quot;in the interest of uniformity&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Revenue does not accept the 1995 appeal hearing was a test case.  The SWAO has no legislative authority to establish precedents.  The appeals office exists only to apply precedents handed down by the courts and not to establish uniquely unlawful precedents that do not exist in any rulings handed down by the courts.  It was this decision on a single person in the SWAO in 1995, which resulted in all couriers and delivery persons at that time being labelled, retrospectively and forever more, as self-employed.  The appeals office hearing of 12 June 1995, which is described as a case having been &quot;selected&quot; as a &quot;representative test case&quot; by the Secretary General in his letter of 2000 to the Committee of Public Accounts, was not a representative test case.  The factual position is that no courier was present or represented at the appeal hearing on 12 June 1995.  These facts were reported on in <i>Business and Finance<\/i>in 2000 and continue to be ignored by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<br\/><br\/>The fact that all appeal hearings are carried out in secret with no possibility of transparency allows the process to be corrupted unchecked.  The Department, in accepting the unlawful precedential test cases created by the SWAO and in using those precedential test cases to classify thousands of workers as self-employed by default, is the biggest creator of bogus self-employed workers in the State.  In reality, the Department and the SWAO go far beyond unlawful test cases to maintain the unlawful <i>status quo<\/i>.  I have summonsed a social welfare inspector to court where he admitted on the stand that he had falsified a report which was exclusively relied upon by social welfare appeals office to overturn a scope section decision that I was an employee and not self-employed.<br\/><br\/>By its own admission, the Department does not measure rates of bogus self-employment.  Only two accurate, widescale investigations have been carried out into bogus self-employment in Ireland.  Both put the rate of bogus self-employment in the construction sector at approximately 20% between 1999 and 2001.  Following the inaugural meeting of the employment status group in 2000 and the issuing of a so called &quot;code of practice&quot;, large-scale investigations into bogus self-employment ceased.  In 2002, I wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General and asked why the State was allowing courier companies to evade their tax and PRSI obligations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General replied: &quot;The arrangement employed is administratively efficient in collecting tax from a sector which traditionally has been recalcitrant when it comes to paying tax.&quot;  Workers do not get a choice to be recalcitrant when it comes to paying tax.  They do not get to negotiate their non-compliance.  The bogus self-employed worker pays exactly the same percentage of PRSI as an employee.  It was, and is, the employer who is evading the lion's share of PRSI.  Employers are evading vast amounts of PRSI through bogus self-employment.  The Comptroller and Auditor General accepted that special tax agreements were not ideal, stating: &quot;All concerned recognise that it is far from being an ideal system and there is room for improvement.&quot;<br\/><br\/>In the 17 years since I wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General, no improvement ever came.  What he described as  &quot;far from being an ideal system&quot; has become the norm.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019102400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1213,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McMahon for his opening statement.

I will start with the legislation.  Members like to put legislation in place, but there is no point in oodles of legislation when the roadblock is the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  One is simply piling more legislation onto an already broken system, and it does not make any difference because the Social Welfare Appeals Office does not use precedents.  It makes up its own precedents and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection accepts those precedents.  No matter what the Oireachtas does, it simply cannot impact on that.  <br\/><br\/>How widespread is it?  I am talking about what is known as schedule D workers, which includes couriers, construction companies and delivery companies.  They are not called schedule D workers because they are highly paid workers.  They are called schedule D workers because they are less than employed.<br\/><br\/>The scale of the problem is massive.  Deputy Paul Murphy spoke to the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners at a finance committee earlier this year, and the chairperson of the finance committee said that there are public services companies, PSCs, being used in all sectors, and it is particularly bad in the IT sector.  Anecdotally more than 50% of people working in the IT sector are on personal service contracts or else they are working for payroll companies.  They are all avoidance schemes.  It can all be dismissed as a tax evasion smokescreen.  Revenue is quite happy to let this persist.  It wants to choose who is or is not self-employed, not based upon legalities, but based upon the employment situation in one's country.  If one wants more builders working in construction, simply remove the requirements to pay PRSI or treat them as employees, and one will get work started again.  It is all precarious and it is all unlawful.<br\/><br\/>What can be done about it exists within the legislation.  Social welfare legislation says that if a case is too complicated or if the issue is too complicated, then it should referred to the Circuit Court.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office has shown itself to be incompetent as has the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Therefore, the only route left available is to refer all these cases to the Circuit Court and to let it decide and not civil servants appointed by the Minister, who are responsible to the Minister and who can be hired and fired by the Minister, depending on what decisions they make.  That is not right.<br\/><br\/>One ends up with a situation where workers, such as couriers and construction workers, are default self-employed.  The employer designates employment status.  We are the only country in the European Union that allows that.  It is impossible for the worker to overturn a default self-employment classification, because one of the precedents that is accepted by the Social Welfare Appeals Office is that companies do not have to give reasons for appeal to have an appeal heard.  The Scope Section makes a decision, which is a legally binding one.  The company then appeals to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office does not look for reasons for appeal; it simply grants a hearing.  Since these hearings are <i>de novo<\/i>, as if the first time, it is a new trial, where everything that happened in Scope is out the door.  Therefore, Scope is a complete dead end and it is designed to fail.  I hope that answers Deputy Brady's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019102400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1571871600,"counter":1220,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McMahon.

It does quite comprehensive investigations.  Scope on its own is a very good office.  It does exactly what it says on the tin, and it works really well.  The problem is that it is left out of the loop, as I outlined in the presentation.  It is sidelined because once an employer or an employee appeal a decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, that office decides, as it did in the test cases, that it does not need to hear why it he or she is appealing the Scope decision.  All he or she needs to say is that he or she intends to appeal the decision.

It ends up being the worker and the company, plus their legal representation, and the Scope Section and the Social Welfare Appeals Office.<\/p> <p>  The Scope deciding officer may have the same status as the deciding officer who is listening to the case, none of whom has legal experience.  I have asked this question.  Social welfare appeals officers are not required to have legal experience, and yet they are making decisions on complicated, large money issues, where a company has negated its entire PRSI responsibility, in a hearing that is held in private, and nobody is allowed to know what goes on.  The only reason I know what went on is because I have spent years investigating it.

Back in the 1970s, PAYE workers went on strike because they felt they were shouldering so much of the burden of the expense of the State, and they were right.  After that, Revenue implemented a system where any company that paid a person over &pound;3,000 had to declare that.  Therefore, Revenue knew that that person was working.  Whether he or she was employed or self-employed, it did not matter; he or she was getting money.  The black economy was being taken under control.  If people were employees, they did not have to make the declaration.  If they were not employees, every company needed to declare.  This is the way it worked.<\/p> <p>  The courier industry emerged in the 1980s, and it grew very large very fast.  All the couriers were being paid on the lump, which means no tax, no PRSI and cash in hand and some of them - and I will say this - also claimed social welfare.  That went on, and so Revenue and social welfare became interested.  They only focused on the worker.  It was a question of how to get the worker into the tax system and not a question of how to get the employer into the tax system.<\/p> <p>  The employers went from taking a position, which was wholly illegal and which was not in compliance with their statutory obligations, and they convinced Revenue that it was a grey area and that it was more unlawful than illegal.
