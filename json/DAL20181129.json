These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres.  As a result of this initiative, over 1,500 residents in five centres has now moved to the independent living model.  In parallel with the delivery of these changes, a number of other accommodation centres are providing self-catering facilities with fresh food provided by either the contractor or the residents themselves.  In total over\u00a02,900 residents in the centres are no longer under the direct provision model as originally set-up, and further progress will be made in this area.<\/p><p>In addition, there have been significant improvements\u00a0to recreation opportunities,\u00a0such as\u00a0the provision of outdoor sports pitches, including all-weather facilities, as well as the introduction of teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.  Friends of the centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.<\/p><p>Following the McMahon report, a standards advisory group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of that report\u00a0and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State.  The standards will meet the standards set out in the recast reception conditions directive and the European Asylum Support Office, EASO, guidance on reception conditions.  Operational standards and indicators will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process.  They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of\u00a0employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the public sector equality and human rights duty.

However, some of the challenges faced by residents of those communities should be identified.  Moville is ten hours, travelling through the six counties, which is not allowable, from Dublin.  Kenmare is probably an overnight trip.  It is possible to travel to Lisdoonvarna in one day, involving a very short period of time in Dublin.  Mount Trenchard does not even have public bus access.

Under the programme, the Government committed to accept up to 4,000 people, mostly Syrian, into the State through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism, established by two Council of the European Union decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme, which is focused on resettling refugees from Lebanon.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland agreed to opt in to Council of the European Union decisions 2015\/1523 and 2015\/1601 which allocated the number of asylum seekers that was to be relocated to each member state participating in these decisions.<\/p><p>Ireland agreed to accept 2,622 persons under these decisions.  As it was not possible to operationalise the commitment in respect of Italy, which numbered 600 persons, the Government agreed to increase the number of refugees it would accept under the resettlement programme.  This includes Syrian refugees who had been given temporary asylum in Lebanon.<br\/><br\/>We committed to accept 1,040 programme refugees under the resettlement strand of the programme.  A total of 928 people have arrived, 875 of whom are Syrian, and 113 people will arrive in mid-December 2018.  My officials are working with the relevant international bodies to ensure that refugees selected during a mission to Lebanon in June 2018 will arrive soon thereafter.<br\/><br\/>The Government has pledged to take a further 945 programme refugees from Lebanon or Jordan by the end of 2019.A further mission to select 231 refugees was carried out in Lebanon in October 2018.  This mission completed our pledge to the EU for 2018.  Two further missions to select 600 persons will take place in 2019.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's EU relocation programme concluded in March 2018.  Overall, 1,022 people, 959 of them Syrian, arrived safely from Greece and work continues on sourcing housing in communities throughout Ireland. <br\/><br\/>As of 27 November, 287 Syrians, including Irish-born children, were living in emergency response and orientation centres. <br\/><br\/>A key step in the integration of refugees is moving them to permanent housing.  The Deputy will appreciate that housing falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I will set out the general processes that apply in the Irish resettlement model.<br\/><br\/><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><br\/><br\/>The Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP, which falls under the ambit of the office for the promotion of migrant integration, OPMI, within my Department has a co-ordinating role in respect of all matters related to the settlement of refugees.<br\/><br\/>Resettlement in communities is co-ordinated by Inter-Agency Working Groups, chaired by the relevant local authority and with members from relevant agencies such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Education and Welfare Service, the education and training board and the IRPP.  Once a family is resettled in a community, an implementing partner procured by the local authority provides appropriate services for a period of twelve to eighteen months.  The standard model is now focussed on an eighteen month period.  The implementing partner plays a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through their expertise in community integration and relevant supports.  The funding for the implementing partner is provided by the IRPP and the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), both managed under the auspices of my Department.<br\/><br\/>The implementation of the programme requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and local authorities are represented on the national task force which oversees delivery of the programme.  The programme is co-ordinated overall by the IRPP, but service provision remains the responsibility of the relevant statutory entity. <br\/><br\/>A total of 1486 Syrians have been housed throughout the country and are accommodated in local authority housing across 18 counties.<br\/><br\/>Overall, 1690 refugees - Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi - have been housed by local authorities and the Irish Red Cross under the programme.  This figure includes Irish born children. In terms of all refugees who have arrived under this programme almost 85 per cent of persons have been housed.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Red Cross is also managing an aspect of the programme to secure accommodation pledged by members of the public.  This is largely being deployed to meet the needs of single persons, as few accommodation options exist within the local authority sector for this cohort.  To date the Red Cross have sourced accommodation for 96 beneficiaries in 11 counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900005#C01300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543489200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has gone back to Lebanon to look for an additional number of refugees mainly from Syria, but also Jordan, where I understand conditions are particularly harsh for refugees.

Part IIA of that Act, comprising sections 19A to 19H, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides for offences relating to illegal trespass and occupation of land which result in a range of specified adverse consequences.

The legislation empowers An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to direct trespassers to leave the land concerned and, if necessary, remove any object belonging to them from the occupied land.

Under this Act it is an offence to forcibly enter land, including buildings, or remain in forcible occupation, or to encourage or advocate the commission of such an offence.  The word \"forcibly\" is defined as using or threatening to use force in respect of persons or property, and such action is not necessarily linked to any other crime.

The amendments proposed under this Bill address certain deficiencies with regard to the conduct of activities regulated under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, and provide for the modernisation of that Act by way of, among other matters, updating stake and prize limits and standardising the minimum gambling and betting age to 18.  Further, it is intended that this Bill will provide greater clarity and certainty for all promoters and participants involved, primarily in local fundraising efforts, and to ensure the best conduct in the promotion of such activities.

Stephen was going about his daily job and was tragically killed as he sat in a parked car on Main Street in Castleblayney.  He was a family man, only 47 years of age in the prime of his life, and it was a life that was being very well lived.  His wife, two children and family and the Border community are this morning reeling, their lives ripped asunder.  He was the assistant sacristan in his local church and was described as the go-to man for many in his community.  The tribute earlier on \"Morning Ireland\" from his local canon reflected that.<\/p>  <p>  The clips we saw on RT&Eacute; and on all media last night from CCTV in Castleblayney on Tuesday evening are like something from the movies, except they are very real for the family and the community.  After crashing into Stephen's parked car at high speed, the driver then drove on and crashed into a pole.  He has since been detained.  It seems that earlier this same person arrived at Castleblayney Garda station, was recognised by a garda who had previously had dealings with him and who then tried to stop this person leaving the station.  The person left, drove on regardless and this tragedy unfolded.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will also join me in paying tribute to Garda Michael Devlin who showed enormous courage and who, I understand, was previously injured on duty.  He showed more courage and bravery again on Tuesday evening and we think of him and his family today.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will agree that, in isolation, this story is horrendously tragic.  When we read the reports today about how the suspect was on the run for a number of years and was well known to the Garda and the PSNI, it will make people question how he was allowed to walk our streets free, let alone drive on our roads, and how many other such cases are there within our system?  Can he confidently say that our garda&iacute; are resourced and have the available knowledge to brief them on this kind of suspect were they to meet a suspect or another one, particularly along the Border which they cross over and back, in such circumstances?  Does the T&aacute;naiste or the Government have a plan to review this incident and how it happened?  How many other people is the Government aware of who are on the run in situations similar to this?  Will the Government and the Garda Commissioner discuss this matter the PSNI?

It is a comprehensive survey with responses from almost 4,000 childcare services across the State.  Its findings, however, do not paint a pretty picture.  The findings in respect of the cost of childcare reinforce the point which was made time and again by my colleague, Deputy Denise Mitchell, particularly in the budget debate where she outlined that the cost of childcare in this State is among the highest in the developed world.  That is a massive issue with a wider social and economic impact.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the cost of providing childcare amounts to a second mortgage every month for many families.  It makes more sense for some of them for one or other parent to opt out of the workforce due to the scandalous costs involved.  That simply is not right and cannot continue.<\/p>  <p>  The average cost of childcare, as outlined in the report, is &euro;178 per week or more than &euro;700 per month.  In many parts of this State, it costs more than &euro;200 per week in some areas, including in the T&aacute;naiste's city of Cork.<\/p><p>In my county, Donegal, we have seen costs rise year on year at the second highest level across the State, at &euro;15 per week.  It is ludicrous that we are seeing those types of increases for hard-pressed families.  In addition, the report finds that capacity is decreasing and the number of available spaces in the sector is falling.  Separate from this morning's report but crucially linked are the difficulties in the sector and the challenges faced by thousands of childcare workers.  It is a sector which, in many cases, pays well below the living wage which means that we are losing experienced, well-trained childcare workers who are going into other professions.  These are skilled, trained workers who are being let down.  When we lose them, it means we are losing places and have a lower quality service in the early years, which are crucial for our child's development.  We cannot just keep our fingers crossed and hope that this will change.  We need to actively work towards fair pay for workers in the sector.<\/p> <p> High quality, affordable childcare is socially and academically beneficial to children.  We all know that.  It also benefits society and the economy by allowing parents to return to work.  We need an early years sector that we can be truly proud of, which we do not have at this point, given the costs and the low pay within the sector.  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that the system is desperately in need of support?  Does he accept that there needs to be reform of the universal childcare subsidy with increased investment by the State to help offset the cost to these families?  Does he accept we need to see an increase in capitation grants to support providers in delivering quality childcare?  Does he accept that there is a need for a sector-wide pay agreement to ensure that every childcare worker in the sector receives, at a minimum, the living wage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900012#K01000","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543493400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I accept that radical change is needed in the childcare sector for many of the reasons the Deputy has outlined but I also want to say that is exactly what is happening.  Over the last four years, we have seen the amount of money available for reforming and changing the childcare sector increase by 117%.  The available budget for childcare has gone from &euro;265 million to &euro;574 million over four budgets.  The report the Deputy refers to shows that more families than ever are taking up childcare subsidies and supports.  More than 200,000 children are now subject to those supports.  There has been a 24% increase on the previous year.  The families of almost 40,000 children have now benefitted from non-means-tested subsidies introduced last year, worth &euro;1,040 per year.<\/p>  <p>  There are signs, although they are only signs, that childcare costs are stabilising.  The cost of full-time childcare has increased by approximately 2% on average over the last year.  This compares to an increase of 4% in the previous year.  It has halved.  We are not there yet.  The Taoiseach often talks about this.  It is about incremental change as we can afford it.  Childcare is arguably the best example of that in government, where we are seeing dramatic change happening over a relatively short period.  We now have a ten year strategy called First 5, which was launched last week.  We saw enhanced subsidies introduced last September which have been accessed by more than 84,000 families.  By the end of next year, which will mark enormous progress in the childcare sector, we will see the introduction of a new affordable childcare scheme.  There will be significant build-up to that.  I accept that this is an area where Ireland has not performed well by international and EU standards but those statistics are changing.

That is at a point when we have the highest cost of childcare in the developed world.  There needs to be radical action, more support and reform of the universal child credit.  The report stipulates clearly that the capacity within the system is not keeping pace with demand.  It also makes it clear that because of the issue with low wages in the sector, we are losing high-quality, highly-trained people with more academic progression than ever seen before, yet the turnaround in a year is 24% of staff.  Unless we deal with this and get our heads out of the sand, we will see more and more pressure not only in the childcare sector but for families.  Will the T&aacute;naiste not look at proposals that we have put forward that would cut the cost of childcare in half and ensure that every worker in the sector would, at a minimum, have the living wage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900013#L00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1543493400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>The only way to measure progress here is to look at trends.

Where is the evidence of that?  In all my time in this House, never has the majority voice in the D&aacute;il been ignored so often as in this D&aacute;il by this Government.<\/p>  <p>  In June of this year, the D&aacute;il passed a motion on Dublin Fire Brigade.  We recognised that Dublin Fire Brigade provides crucial ambulance services.  The D&aacute;il rejected the suggestion of merging that ambulance service with the National Ambulance Service and of removing any element of Dublin Fire Brigade's fire-based emergency medical service system.  The D&aacute;il accepted a Labour Party amendment to that motion, calling on the Government to implement in full the report of the expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services in Dublin which was published in December 2015.  What has the Government's response been?  As far as we can tell, management in Dublin City Council is not engaging in a process of discussion with Dublin Fire Brigade.  We understand that simple, low-cost technical solutions are available to address specific concerns raised by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  This would permit a seamless communication link-up between Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service.<\/p>  <p>  We have invested over the years to create a system of fire-based emergency response, including ambulances and highly-trained paramedics in our fire service.  It is fairly unique for the fire service to be trained paramedics.  It is a great addition.  Other countries are moving in that direction.  In the UK, there is a move towards integrating blue light services.  They see that as best practice, to generate efficiencies and enhance public safety.  We have been doing it in this city for over 100 years.<\/p><p>For some unknown reason, we have decided to move in the other direction from what is now regarded as best practice elsewhere, which is to model on what has been achieved in Dublin.  There is a concern that our fire-based ambulance services are not being properly funded.  This, of course, in and of itself is a risk to public safety.

We also know Ireland has the fifth lowest revenue to GDP ratio in the European Union, the figures being 35% for Ireland and 40% for the EU.  Ireland is a low tax country.  The real question is why it is a low tax country.  Of course, the answer to this question is that the Government and previous Governments pursued a conscious and deliberate policy of protecting the massive wealth of the rich and powerful in our society and has allowed them not to pay their fair share of taxation.  We know the top 10% of income recipients pay a smaller proportion of their income in all taxes than the bottom 10% of recipients.  We know the top 10% of financial asset holders now have approximately &euro;40 billion more than they had at peek boom levels in 2006 and they are not asked to pay a cent from this windfall.  We also know the share of gross income going to the top 1% of earners increased from 34% in 2011 to 39% in 2016.  We also know that more than half of the increase in total income over the past five years has gone to 10% of the highest earners.<\/p>  <p>  The country has become unequal and this has been accelerated in the recent budget.  We know the 300 wealthiest individuals, who have &euro;100 billion, will not pay a cent of tax on this.

Will the Government bring forward legislation to remedy the situation revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General recently whereby 83 high net worth individuals, with in excess of &euro;50 million in assets each, declare taxable incomes of less than the average industrial wage?

I have spoken about this matter on numerous occasions in the House.  We hope to publish the plan in 2020 in order to give people a look at what it will involve.  Until we get to that point, we will not be able to meet the demand that exists.  There is no point in pretending that we will.  Last year, we delivered 17 million home help hours and I hope to improve on that this year.  The service plan will be agreed in the next week to ten days.  We certainly will improve on that figure but we will not get to where we need to be.  The current system is not fit for purpose and involves sending people 7 miles north or 8 miles south for half an hour here and half an hour there.  We cannot get the people we need to deliver the service either.  There are challenges on a number of fronts.  We are making every effort to try to allocate whatever resources are available, but we are competing with other areas.  Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on health is seeking equalisation for consultants, home help and other items, all of which cost &euro;20 million, &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.

I am pleased to say that the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill 2018 proposes only one amendment to one section of the legislation that was enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this year.  The section the Bill seeks to amend, or rather to replace, is section 30.  The version of section 30 that was enacted deals with the micro-targeting and profiling of children.  It provides expressly that it would be an offence under the Act for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child as defined by section 29 for the purposes of direct marketing, profiling or micro-targeting.<\/p><p>The purpose of section 30, as enacted, is to protect children from being marketed junk food and drinks.  The total lifetime cost of childhood obesity in Ireland is estimated to be approximately &euro;4.6 billion.  In addition, there is a significant problem with the number of children experiencing childhood obesity.  At present, research estimates that 55,000 children currently living in Ireland and 85,000 on the island of Ireland will die prematurely due to being overweight or obese.  We note research by the World Obesity Federation which predicts that, by 2025, up to 141,000 schoolchildren in Ireland will be overweight or obese and as many as 9,000 will have impaired glucose intolerance.  The consequences of childhood obesity are significant, not just for the individual child as he or she develops into adulthood but also for the healthcare system.<\/p><p>The purpose of section 30 is to deal with that problem.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality did not commence the section as a result of advice he received from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that it is incompatible with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  There are two concerns in this regard.  The section, as enacted, expands upon the permitted restrictions to the processing of personal data.  There was a concern that the term &quot;micro-targeting&quot; was non-specific and undefined and that, consequently, people who were committing an offence did not know the specific nature of that offence and that, as a result, the provision would be unfair on them.  The Office of the Attorney General wrote to the European Commission outlining its concerns and asked it for its views regarding the compatibility of section 30 of the Act.  The Office of the Attorney General confirmed that the section would not be brought into effect until such time as it received information and advice from the Commission.<\/p><p>We note that advice was provided by the European Commission which clarified that, as set out in recital 38 of the GDPR, children merit special protection, particularly where the personal data of children is being used for marketing or creating personality-of-user profiles.  The letter confirmed that while direct marketing to children is a permissible activity under the GDPR, this provision must be balanced by the interests of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data, especially where the data subject is a child.  Consequently, the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing is not unlawful.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a new wording for section 30, which seeks to overcome the concerns identified by the Office of the Attorney General and to take into account the advice presented by the European Commission.  The wording is consistent with the wording of Article 22 of the GDPR and the rights and restrictions it introduces.  It removes the reference to there being &quot;an offence&quot; and replaces it with the word &quot;unlawful&quot;, and it will make it easier for a data subject to vindicate his or her rights under the Data Protection Act.  It also removes any debate as to whether an offence has been lawfully created.  The Bill proposes to amend section 30 of the Data Protection Act so that we can seek to give effect to the protection that no doubt everyone in the House believes should apply to protect children from micro-targeting, particularly in the context of junk food and junk drinks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P00600","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543495800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P00900","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543495800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Gn\u00f3 na D\u00e1la - Business of D\u00e1il","time":1543495800,"counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>It is proposed notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that item No. 20a, motion re amendment of resolution appointing Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan to the Disclosures Tribunal, shall be taken without debate immediately following item No. 20, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P01200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P01400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>We want to call a vote on that last one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P01500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>This is just a proposal on the business of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P01600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1543495800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>It is a proposal to take the motion which was already agreed earlier at the Business Committee.

We are hoping the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and others will have seen that the housing and homelessness crisis has become such an epidemic that it is now necessary to undertake these measures.  The Bill is urgently required to prevent many of the cases of homelessness that we are now seeing.  Homelessness has increased by 57.4% since this Government came into office.  The shameful figures of 10,000 homeless in emergency accommodation is widely known.  However, the much larger effects of hidden homelessness and the ongoing ripple of homelessness for everybody is also very important.<\/p><p>The solution to the housing and homelessness crisis is of course the building on public land of thousands of new public homes that are affordable for people to buy or rent.  Doing so would take people off the waiting lists and make homes available to the thousands of families struggling with rent and unable to get mortgage approval.  This Bill aims to put a bandage on the haemorrhage to stop the ongoing evictions that are taking place.  On 26 May, the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>outlined the main reasons for terminations of tenancies.  Some 36% are because a landlord is selling; 16% because a family member is moving in; and 10% due to renovation.  If passed, the Bill will give tenants the right to remain in a property if it is being sold.  It would allow a tenancy continue in the case of renovation and would require compensation to be paid to a tenant where a property is required for family use, hopefully to act as a deterrent for abuse of that aspect of the law.  The chief executive of Threshold has said many landlords are abusing the legislation to hike up rent yields by using &quot;fake sale&quot;, or by falsely saying there is a family member moving in or that there is a need for renovations.  They are called dubious terminations.  These are not just loopholes; the D&aacute;il has been made well aware of them and has refused to close them.  They need to be closed.<\/p><p>Commercial tenants can remain in a property but human tenants are evicted when a property is being sold.  That is Leo Varadkar's and Fine Gael's Ireland.<\/p> <p> The Bill makes a range of other changes to improve the position of tenants.  Clarity will be given to the landlord-tenant relationship where a receiver takes possession.  Tenancies of more than two months will be given much more security and there is also an extension of notice periods.<\/p> <p> Another important aspect of the Bill that was not covered in the 2016 Bill is giving tenant rights to students in specific student accommodation.  Solidarity has been in contact with USI about this and we are very anxious to advance it in the Bill.<\/p> <p> The homelessness crisis is getting more depraved.  This morning I was contacted by a young couple.  The young man works nights.  He effectively has no access to emergency accommodation because he works nights.  Those faced with homelessness and housing crises are working people who often get up very early in the morning.  In this man's case they are trying to have a home to which to return when he finishes work early in the morning.  What does it say about capitalism that working people are not even able to secure accommodation?  It is back to Dickensian times.<\/p> <p> Given this D&aacute;il's ideological commitment to profit for private landlords and investors, rents are skyrocketing.  A one-bedroom apartment in Berlin or Vienna would cost &euro;8,500 less than Dublin.  In Paris it would cost &euro;4,500 less.  In Copenhagen it would cost &euro;3,000 less.  Given the commitment to capitalism and private profit, the law gives more weight to landlords and private property rights than to the right of people to a home.  Thousands of young people are suffering.  Many who are living with parents may want to move on in life, but are unable to do so.  The National Housing and Homelessness Coalition has called for a demonstration on Saturday, starting at the Garden of Remembrance at 2 p.m.  I hope this is the start of a massive movement against the housing crisis and for real action to build public homes.  This Bill is a contribution to that movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900017#P02300","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543496400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543496400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900018#Q00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1543496400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900018#Q00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1543496400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900018#Q00500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543496400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2018: Motion","time":1543496400,"counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900018#Q00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1543496400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2018,copies of which were laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 20th November, 2018.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900018#Q00800","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"vote","time":1543496700,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 92; N\u00edl, 26; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Se\u00e1n Kyne and Tony McLoughlin; N\u00edl, Deputies Ruth Coppinger and Paul Murphy.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900019#R00100","aye":["1368","1246","1219","1321","1272","1310","1354","1293","1369","1220","1307","1335","1260","1241","1357","1218","1336","1263","1221","1339","1286","1217","1285","1298","1364","1261","1338","1292","1274","1322","1264","1300","1214","1441","1216","1313","1318","1275","1360","1320","1319","1348","1353","1365","1229","1349","1314","1311","1240","1346","1243","1224","1337","1359","1347","1223","1248","1290","1343","1247","1363","1284","1283","1262","1295","1342","1315","1328","1440","1326","1228","1296","1227","1267","1329","1278","1257","1324","1325","1312","1370","1366","1334","1213","1301","1344","1276","1270","1271","1277","1250","1358"],"nay":["1432","1238","1252","1361","1279","1306","1434","1309","1303","1317","1266","1299","1345","1362","1333","1226","1433","1280","1302","1215","1269","1287","1294","1222","1367","1232"],"abs":[]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Disclosures Tribunal: Motion","time":1543496700,"counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900019#R00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1543496700,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the Resolution of the D&aacute;il of 13th November, 2018, in relation to the Tribunal of Inquiry into protected disclosures made under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and certain other matters, be amended by the substitution of &lsquo;Honourable Mr. Justice Sean Ryan&rsquo; for &lsquo;Honourable Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan&rsquo; in both places where it occurs.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900019#R00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543496700,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Housing Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1543497300,"counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900020#S00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1543497300,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to Second Stage of the Social Housing Bill 2016, taken on Thursday, 22 November 2018.
