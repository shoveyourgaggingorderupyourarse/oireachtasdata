Due to social distancing and public confidence issues, the reopening of live performance and entertainment venues will prove challenging.  While the Government's objective is to get people back to work as quickly as possible, public health and safety remains a top priority.  This is why the move to Phase 4 of the Roadmap for reopening society and business was paused.  The current restrictions of 50 people at indoor gatherings and 200 people at outdoor gatherings have been extended to 10 August.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a guide for organisations making assessments and adapting workplace procedures and practices to comply with the COVID-19 public health protection measures.

Accordingly, all National Parks in Ireland are fully owned and managed by the State. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017 the partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland was created to achieve the shared goal of further developing quality experiences at our National Parks and Nature Reserves.  One major output from the Department's Strategic Partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, was a Masterplan for the six National Parks and Nature Reserves. This provides a high level and integrated blueprint for the NPWS to invest in and better manage the Parks for conservation, biodiversity and visitor alike. In effect, it enables the aligning of conservation objectives of the Parks with increasing visitor appeal and numbers.  The Masterplan guides the phased development of these enhanced visitor facilities and improved visitor experiences based on research into international best practice.  The Department intends to produce visitor and management plans for its National Parks on an on-going basis, the availability of resources permitting.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and recreation product, it has been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. In this context, it should be noted that my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; owned re-wilding project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019 over &euro;5m from the Rural Regeneration fund was announced for the Parks and Reserves providing infrastructure that allows sustainable access to them. Most of these projects have been initiated and some of those recently concluded include the purchase of Electric Buses for visitors of Glenveagh National Park, improved trail networks in the Sliabh Blooms and enhanced trails in Dromore and Derrycrag Nature Reserves. In the last 5 years to date over &euro;16.3m in current funding and nearly &euro;7.8m in capital funding has been spent in our National Parks and Reserves, in areas including invasive species control and infrastructure improvement. <\/p>  <p>  Given the resources available for investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am of course mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands; the Department focuses on conservation objectives for Natura 2000 sites. Ireland's 3rd National Biodiversity Plan runs from 2017 to 2021 and captures the objectives, targets and actions for biodiversity to be undertaken by a wide range of stakeholders in government, civil society and private sectors to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s Vision for Biodiversity not just in our own National Parks but countrywide. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200069#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Night-Time Economy","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200069#WRA04050"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[17280\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200069#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the development of the night-time economy taskforce; if the taskforce will advance the appointment of a night-time culture mayor for Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[17279\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200069#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the development of the night-time economy taskforce; if the taskforce will advance the appointment of a night-time culture mayor for Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a Night time Economy Taskforce is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and my Department is leading on this commitment.

The support and cooperation of key Departments and agencies and local authorities will be vital to the success of this initiative and my Department is currently writing to these Departments and agencies to seek nominations to the Taskforce.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce will also consult with and inform the various interest groups who have been involved in the development of this initiative, as the work progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200069#WRA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":66,"content":"<p>Question No. 47 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maoini&uacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200070#WRB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[17295\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200070#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist aici taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don athchomarc at&aacute; &aacute; lorg ag Comhchumann agus muintir Rath Chairn i gcoinne cead plean&aacute;la a bhronn An Bord Plean&aacute;la do tithe agus l&oacute;ist&iacute;n bheith t&oacute;gtha san Ghaeltacht acu gan coinn&iacute;ollacha teanga l&aacute;idir bheith ceangailte leis.","asker":"1485","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>Is ceist don Aire Tith&iacute;ochta &iacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os ar nd&oacute;igh. &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, faoin Acht um Plean&aacute;il agus Forbairt 2000, tugtar an deis do mo Roinn agus d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta tuairim&iacute; a thabhairt do na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is phlean&aacute;la faoi ch&aacute;sanna plean&aacute;la a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh tionchar a imirt ar an nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. <\/p>  <p>  Faoi Alt 28 de na Rialach&aacute;in um Plean&aacute;il agus Forbairt 2001, is g&aacute; d'&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta faoina gc&uacute;ram teagmh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh le mo Roinn agus le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta chun a dtuairim&iacute; a fh&aacute;il maidir le forbairt&iacute; dar leo a d'fh&eacute;adfadh cur isteach ar oidhreacht chult&uacute;rtha agus teanga na Gaeltachta.<\/p>  <p>  Maidir leis an gc&aacute;s plean&aacute;la i nGaeltacht R&aacute;th Chairn, tuigtear dom gur chuir mo Roinn  aighneacht chuig Comhairle Contae na M&iacute; faoin gc&aacute;s &aacute;irithe seo -  i gcomhr&eacute;ir le alt 28 de na Rialach&aacute;in - ag moladh go gcuirf&iacute; coinn&iacute;oll leis an gcead a d'fh&aacute;gfadh gur do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge amh&aacute;in a mbeadh na tithe a bh&iacute; mar &aacute;bhar an iarratais plean&aacute;la coinnithe.

The grant can be used to defray ongoing fixed costs, e.g., utilities and insurance or for replenishing stock and for measures needed to ensure employee and customer safety. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I should point out that the July stimulus package will further help to alleviate the significant challenges arising from Covid-19 across the economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200070#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Policy","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200070#WRB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[17290\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200070#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans to increase the provision of affordable workspaces for artists and creative practitioners in County Cork.","asker":"1516","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>Late last year, a new &euro;4.7m capital investment scheme was launched for arts and culture centres across the country.

This scheme is funded by the Arts Council and is administered on its behalf by Visual Artists Ireland. The purpose of the Visual Artists Workspace Scheme is to support artists&rsquo; workspaces throughout the country to provide the best possible working environment for visual artists and, where feasible, to enable a level of subsidy for the artists working in these spaces.  I understand that under this scheme, Visual Artists Ireland invites applications for grants of up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 towards running costs such as light, heat, rent, artists&rsquo; development programmes, administration and\/or appropriate salary costs. A small proportion may be directed toward essential maintenance and equipment expenditure.

CETA has provisionally applied since 21st September 2017 meaning that duties on 98% of products (tariff lines) that the EU trades with Canada have been removed. The reduced trade barriers, tariff elimination, simplified customs procedures and more compatible technical requirements all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada. <\/p><p>International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties and defined as the Common Commercial Policy.  Under this architecture the Commission represents Ireland and other Member States in taking into account the needs of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union in international trade negotiations. <\/p><p>Bilaterally, business links between Ireland and Canada are deep and extensive - outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market. More than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients are doing business in the Canadian market with over 6,000 people in Canada employed by Enterprise Ireland clients. This strong economic relationship, as well Ireland's support for a fully implemented CETA, was emphasised to our Canadian partners by former Minister of State at my Department Pat Breen during a Trade Mission to Canada in May 2019.  While the 2020 Programme of Trade Missions had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department sees the Canadian market as continuing to present strong opportunities for Irish exporters and, therefore, foresees Canada featuring again in our 2021 Trade Mission Programme. <\/p><p>I might also add that my Department's analysis has found that when comparing the last full year of trade prior to the provisional application of CETA, 2016, and the first full year of provisional application, 2018, trade grew by 27%. Furthermore, the cost of service barriers to trade will, on average, be reduced under CETA by 10 per cent in Canada and by 4 per cent in the EU. Moreover, the benefits and opportunities to business in the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) - in areas such as regulatory co-operation, trade facilitation measures, streamlined administration etc. - contained within CETA will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.<\/p><p>To date, 14 Member States have signaled to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union the completion of their respective national ratification procedures while several other Member States are currently progressing approval of the Agreement.

If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann votes in favour of the Agreement, Ireland will subsequently notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union that we have completed our respective internal requirements and procedures concerning the ratification of CETA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200071#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200071#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[17521\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200071#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the measures being taken to encourage continued up-take among SMEs of the Enterprise Ireland Brexit SME scorecard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1562","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>In 2017, Enterprise Ireland developed and launched a Brexit SME Scorecard, an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.

It is not an instruction to open such businesses but a recommendation that it can be safe do so, provided appropriate measures to protect the health of workers and customers are taken.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of guidance to assist businesses, including driving instructors, a National Return to Work Safely Protocol has been produced under the aegis of the Labour Employer Economic Forum and is the result of a collaborative effort by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The HSA has in turn produced COVID-19 checklists and templates, based on the Protocol, to help employers, business owners and managers to get their business up and running again and to inform workers about what they need to do to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA developed protocols in relation to the resumption of driver testing, based on the overall national protocol and the additional templates and checklists from the HSA.  I understand that the National Office of Traffic Medicine was also available to the RSA to assist in its task.  The RSA shared these protocols with driving instructors via a series of Frequently Asked Questions when, in anticipation of the resumption of driver testing on 29 June, the Authority wrote to each Approved Driving Instructor(ADI) on 22 June, advising them of the planned phased return of driver testing.  These protocols may assist driving instructors in taking the necessary measures resuming their businesses safely.<\/p>  <p>  Neither the RSA nor the Department can instruct driving schools on how they should run their business.  It is up to each driving instructor or driving school to protect themselves, their families and customers by adhering to the official Government guidelines on hygiene and social distancing.<\/p>  <p>  When reviewing proposals from the RSA for resuming services in line with the Roadmap, the Department asked about engagement with the ADI sector in relation to the plan.  The Department was advised that the RSA was engaging with the Stakeholder Forum for ADIs as well as communicating directly with each ADI to update them and to direct their attention to information on the RSA website including the Frequently Asked Questions. In dealing with ADIs on COVID and indeed on other matters, it is important to note they are not employees or contractors of the RSA but are individual\/independent operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200071#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[17495\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200071#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if measures will be put in place to prevent incoming travel from countries and regions currently experiencing a high Covid-19 infection rate.","asker":"1596","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>As you are no doubt aware, the Department of Health is the lead Government Department in relation to public health matters, including COVID-19 and also measures taken at ports and airports in relation to arriving passengers.<\/p><p>Measures to protect public health are recommended by the National Emergency Public Health Team (NPHET) within the Department of Health, and my Department and its agencies follow the government's public health advice. <\/p><p>All queries in relation to public health should therefore be directed to the Department of Health. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200071#WRC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[17513\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200071#WRC04900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding persons entering and exiting Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>I would like to advise the Deputy that our State Airports have remained open during the Covid-19 crisis to ensure critical supply chains have been able to remain operational, and citizens have been able to return home.

I understand that about 90% of the commercial bus operators have suspended their services or are providing significantly reduced services at present. My Department has engaged with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland (CTTC) on a regular basis in relation to the impact of Covid-19 on licensed bus operators.<\/p><p>The sharp decline in passenger numbers since mid-March this year as a result of the Covid-19 health emergency has caused an unprecedented fall in fare revenues, thus creating a wide gap between the operators' costs and actual revenues. From my Department's engagement with their representatives, and indeed from the NTA's regular engagement with them throughout the crisis, I understand the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing.  Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.<\/p><p>It is critical for the public transport sector to be functioning so that it can carry the passengers that we need to return to work and to other activities as they re-open.  Many of these operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery.<\/p><p>For that reason, the Deputy will be pleased to know that on 25 June the Government approved temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector.  These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering funding support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.<\/p><p>This is, of course, additional to the wider programme of Government supports introduced for impacted businesses, including new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example.  <\/p><p>With the commencement of Phase 3 of the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business<\/i>on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of bus and rail fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services provided by both public and commercial licensed operators during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport for the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business<\/i>.

This requirement is set down in Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was developed in a short period of time, having regard to the overarching urgent Government objective of getting assistance to employers and employees quickly.  <\/p>  <p>  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020.  There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work part-time or full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  However, the employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS.  At the same time, there is no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational systems reasons the employer needs to enter at least &euro;0.01 in gross pay when running its payroll.<\/p>  <p>  The question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are matters that are outside the remit of the TWSS. The scheme has no role in relation to the employer\/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned. <\/p>  <p>  As the public health restrictions are eased, the challenge for the economy and enterprises is evolving. Having regard to the novel circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, in early June it was announced that the TWSS will remain until the end of August. Work has been ongoing and is at an advanced stage around how best to support employers into the more medium term.

I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders.  However, it is important to emphasise that neither I, nor the Central Bank can direct or require that insurers cover claims, including those resulting from infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Furthermore, it is not a matter for the Government or Central Bank to adjudicate on the validity of such claims. If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation. I understand that this is already happening in a number of cases.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst I have no legal authority to compel an insurer to pay a claim, I believe that as a general rule insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  I believe that they should engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  I have outlined these views to the insurance industry on a number of occasions, such as on my letter to Insurance Ireland on the 27 March and indicated amongst other things that<\/p>  <p>  (i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage; and,<\/p>  <p>  (ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on 3 April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close.  Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my officials and I have had extensive engagement with the insurance industry regarding insurers offering supports and reliefs to businesses during the COVID-19 emergency. The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on 10 April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - would ensure that a number of common forbearance measures are available to their business customers.   The agreement covered a commitment by insurers to reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability\/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor. The agreement also has a commitment to maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings\/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days).  I believe that this agreement was a positive step, but it was also critical that  insurers delivered upon their commitments.  Therefore, I asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism which provides proof of delivery.  My Department received the second &ldquo;Activity Report&rdquo; on this issue from Insurance Ireland on 17 July. This Report shows that in the period from 23 March to 15 June, Insurance Ireland members processed 9,789 forbearance requests for business customers worth a total of &euro;9,601,331. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. This included the Bank&rsquo;s belief that while most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that  I have also held two meetings with the Alliance of Insurance Reform, the latest meeting which took place on 17 June.  These meetings were very useful as I was able to hear first-hand the issues faced by businesses in relation to insurance.  A further meeting with the Alliance is being held today.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to state that Minister Fleming and I along with my Cabinet colleagues are prioritising reform of the insurance sector. This is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s extensive cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which amongst other things seeks to address consumer and business concerns on the cost and availability of insurance by building on the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200072#WRD05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200072#WRD05100"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[17485\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200072#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider extending the payment date on inheritance tax as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in view of the fact many will have been unable to prepare and sell properties in time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>The standard rate of Capital Acquisitions Tax is 33%. There are three tax-free thresholds depending on the relationship between the disponer and the beneficiary, with CAT applying on the amount inherited or gifted over the thresholds, as follows:<\/p><p><b>Group A<\/b>threshold (&euro;335,000) - Applies where the beneficiary is a child (including certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an absolute inheritance from a child.<\/p><p><b>Group B<\/b>threshold (&euro;32,500) - Applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, niece, nephew, or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<\/p><p><b>Group C<\/b>threshold (&euro;16,250) - Applies in all other cases.<\/p><p>All gifts\/inheritances received since 1991 from all disponers in the relevant group must be aggregated together when calculating the taxable value. The balance of gifts or inheritance above the threshold is taxable.  <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the date on which inheritance tax is payable is determined by the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; on which the market value of the property included in an inheritance must be established. Where this date is between 1 January and 31 August, inheritance tax is payable by 31 October in the same year. Where this date is between 1 September and 31 December, inheritance tax is payable by 31 October in the following year.<\/p><p>Section 30 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 contains the rules for determining the valuation date. The valuation date depends on the circumstances particular to a case and is not a fixed date in relation to all inheritances. This date can be earlier than the date on which property is given to a beneficiary as it is the date on which the executors of a will become entitled to retain the property for the benefit of a beneficiary. Generally, this is the date on which probate or administration is granted.<\/p><p>Where the benefit consists of property, it may well be the case that inheritance tax is payable before a beneficiary has received the property due to a delay in completing the administration of an estate. Equally, where a beneficiary has actually received the property, inheritance tax may be payable before a beneficiary has had the opportunity to sell that property and pay the tax liability. Outside of the current COVID-19 circumstances, the length of the conveyancing process is such that it is often the case that an inheritance tax liability arises before a property can be sold to pay that liability. To provide for such situations, taxpayers have a statutory entitlement to payment by instalments in certain circumstances.  Monthly instalment payments for up to five years may be allowed subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8%. However, Revenue has discretion to allow payment by instalments over a longer period in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship. In such circumstances, Revenue also has discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the inheritance involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200072#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200072#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[17508\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200072#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the level of excise duty raised by the Exchequer via on-trade alcohol sales from pubs per month during 2019, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a breakdown of the Excise Duty in respect of alcohol sales from pubs is not available.

Peatlands - Infringement No. 2010\/2161 - this case relates to the regulation of peatlands under the Habitats Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. A peatlands programme of measures  has been developed, in discussion with the European Commission. The programme outlines the measures which the State is undertaking as regards the conservation, management and restoration of peatlands, in response to the issues raised by the Commission. These measures are rooted in a number of key policy documents agreed by the Government - the National Peatlands Strategy, the Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network and the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022.<\/p>  <p>  2. Designation and Conservation of Special Areas of Conservation- Infringement No. 2015\/2006 - this case relates to a requirement, under the Habitats Directive, for Member States to designate special areas of conservation, set site-specific conservation objectives and establish site-specific conservation measures. My Department is implementing its Special Areas of Conservation Designation, Conservation and Management Work Programme. 276 sites have been designated as special areas of conservation by Statutory Instrument, 364  special area of conservation site-specific conservation objectives have been set and published, site-specific conservation measures have been prepared for 53 special areas of conservation and a range of conservation schemes are in place such as the European Innovation partnerships and green, low carbon, agri-environment scheme (GLAS) administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme administered by my Department. Sites are protected under Irish law from the time they are publicly nominated for designation as  special areas of conservation i.e. all 439 special area of conservation sites are protected under the provisions of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.<\/p>  <p>  3. Articles 6 and 11 of EU Access and Benefit-Sharing of Genetic Resources Regulation No. 511\/2014 -  Infringement No. 2017\/2171 -   this case relates to the EU Regulation on  Access and Benefit-Sharing of Genetic Resources which creates a legal framework for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits that arise should the resources be utilised for the purposes of research and development and \/ or lead to commercial use within the scope of the Nagoya Protocol.  The European Union (Nagoya Protocol onAccess to Genetic Resources and Benefit-Sharing) Regulations 2019, which transpose the EU regulation into Irish law, were  signed by the then Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht , Josepha Madigan T.D., on 6 June 2019.  The Commission was notified of the signing of the regulations on 27   June 2019. The response of the European Commission is awaited. <\/p>  <p>  4. The EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation No. 1143\/2014 - Infringement No. 2018\/2319 - this case relates to the EU Regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species. The legislation transposing this regulation into Irish law  is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Regulations were made in 2018 specifically to ban the import of non-native crayfish because of a serious threat to the native species from any such introduction (European Union (Invasive Alien Species) (Freshwater Crayfish) Regulations 2018).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200073#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200073#WRE03400"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[17527\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200073#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the legislation on heritage matters that has not yet concluded all stages; and the status of each Bill in tabular form.

This year 450 heritage projects across every county in the country will benefit from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes.<\/p>  <p>  This funding will support the owners and custodians of historic and protected structures as they carry out hundreds of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and safeguard our built heritage as well as providing vital support for local jobs in conservation, traditional skills and construction.  Details of all projects approved for 2020 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as on each local authority website.

The House is aware  that the Government allocated an additional &euro;20m to the Council, bringing its 2020 allocation to &euro;100m and the Houses of the Oireachtas voted the Supplementary Estimate through earlier this month.  The Arts Council has indicated that it will allocate a significant portion of the additional funding to bursaries and commissions to artists and arts organisations over the coming weeks and months.  This was recommended by the <i>Survive, Adapt, Renew <\/i>report<i><\/i>which also included recommendations that the Arts Council:-<\/p><p>- Supports the arts sector in addressing the challenges of digital presentation and dissemination in the near and longer term, as well as in exploring new ways for people to make and engage with art in person.<\/p><p>- Works with the arts sector and other partners, including local authorities, to address the challenges of adapting existing physical spaces and exploring new ones.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department has supported a range of initiatives to bring cultural and creative content to the public during the period of restrictions. These include Culture Ireland's<i>Ireland Performs <\/i>initiative, Other Voices Courage, Criuni&uacute; na nOg, as well as the Hot Press <i>Lockdown Sessions<\/i>.  These initiatives employed artists, musicians performing live as well as technicians and crew.<\/p><p>Last week, in response to the COVID-19 crisis I announced specific capital funding to facilitate the safe re-opening of theatres, arts centres and culture venues.

The Guidelines for the Scheme and Application Form are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>On the broad level of supports, in order to help many sectors including the Irish music and events industry to overcome the unprecedented challenges posed by Covid-19, the Government has put in place a package of supports  that includes direct grants, low-cost loans, the write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These measures are designed to restore confidence and further assist organisations in terms of their management and business continuity and in turn planning for the weeks and months ahead.<\/p><p>A  number of universal supports in place for all sectors including the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme for employers operated by the Revenue Commissioners which has now been extended as has the Pandemic Unemployment Payment administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  In addition to these there are jobseekers benefit and jobseekers assistance schemes as well as Jobseekers Assistance for Self-Employed Artists.<\/p><p>In addition to the measures announced by the Government in the context of the July stimulus, the Government has also committed to bringing forward a National Economic Plan, to be published alongside the Budget in October, which will outline the Government&rsquo;s plans to support the long-term sustainability of the economy.

The Audiovisual Action Plan is designed to deliver on the commitment in Pillar 4 to create an industry-wide plan to make Ireland a leader in the audiovisual sector and is intended to drive both increased investment and production across the sector by implementing policy recommendations in 8 key areas. Implementation of the Plan is overseen by a high level Steering Group comprising representatives from a cross section of Government Departments and state agencies. <\/p><p>The cultural, creative and economic potential of Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual industry is significant and Government policy has long supported the sector through <i>inter alia <\/i>the section 481 tax relief, international film co-production treaties and through funding provided to Screen Ireland, which is the development agency for the Irish film industry. <\/p><p>As part of Project Ireland 2040, this Department published &lsquo;Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027&rsquo;, in 2018 which sets out a commitment of close to &euro;1.2 billion in capital funding for culture and creativity over ten-year period. &euro;200 million of this has been allocated for investment in media production and the audiovisual industry within same the period. This funding, is being delivered through Screen Ireland whose statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  Screen Ireland supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects. Screen Ireland has a vision for a vibrant, creative and sustainable Irish film, television and animation industry, with diverse voices, talent and opportunities which speaks to and connects Irish film culture with audiences at home and abroad. For 2020, Screen Ireland was allocated an additional &euro;1 million to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television drama, documentary and animation.  This increases its annual overall budget to &euro;21 million. In light of the COVID19 crisis, in addition to its normal production and development rounds, Screen Ireland has already allocated &euro;4.5 million in COVID19 support measures for the Irish film and TV industry. Importantly, the measures are directed to the sustainability of the industry with a strong focus on development support. This is intended to ensure companies are well positioned for launch as production recommences.

Building on work during the second cycle, this plan will describe the main pressures and activities affecting water status, set out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027 and identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives.<\/p><p>My Department is engaging in public consultation at three critical phases in the river basin management process. These are:<\/p><p>1. Outlining the draft timetable and consultation arrangements for development of second cycle RBMP,<\/p><p>2. Identification of the significant water management issues for the third round of planning, and<\/p><p>3. Publication of draft river basin management plans.<\/p><p>In relation to the first phase, my Department launched a six-month consultation on the draft timetable and work programme for the third cycle in December 2018. In response to this consultation my Department received 28 submissions from a mix of individuals, community groups, local authorities, companies and other key stakeholders.<\/p><p>A public consultation on the Significant Water Management Issues (SWMI) for Ireland, which is currently underway, is the second phase of engagement in the development of the final plan. The purpose of this consultation phase is to gather stakeholder&rsquo;s views and reach agreement on what are considered to be the significant water management issues and how they should be addressed in the planning process for the next plan. Further details of this consultation is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .<\/p><p>To obtain the views of stakeholders and to discuss whether appropriate issues had been identified for inclusion in the consultation document, initial input was also sought from various stakeholders. This took place through bi-lateral engagements, such as meetings with the Environmental Protection Agency, An Foram Uisce (The National Water Forum), the Local Authority Waters Programme (LAWPRO), as well as a wider stakeholder event held on 19 November 2019 in Dublin Castle for approximately 80 stakeholders. These engagements allowed my Department to finalise the public consultation document that outlined 4 societal factors and 8 environmental pressures for consideration. <\/p><p>Launched on 20 December 2019, the consultation document also sets out the background to the Water Framework Directive and the development of RBMPs, the current status of our surface, ground and estuarine waters and the pressures thereon and what we understand to be the significant water management issues facing Ireland in the next RBMP cycle.  People are invited to provide their views on the issues identified, suggest actions to address these issues and identify any other issues that could be addressed in the next plan.<\/p><p>In addition to the normal notification on the website, the Department undertook to raise awareness of the consultation process by sending notifications to various stakeholders, through the placement of newspaper advertisements and with the issuing of regular tweets.<\/p><p>With consultation periods required to run for a minimum of 6 months under the Water Framework Directive, this consultation was due to close on Friday, 26 June.  However, due to Covid-19 and the restrictions people faced during the public consultation period, there has been an extension to the public consultation on the Significant Water Management Issues for Ireland. The extended consultation will now run until 5pm on Friday, 7 August 2020.<\/p><p>Following the completion of the consultation, the responses will be gathered and analysed by officials with a view to using the information to influence the shape of the draft RBMP. The responses received will also be considered by WPAC - the Water Policy Advisory Committee (established under S.I. 350 of 2014 to advise the Minister on development of RBMPs and implementation of the Water Framework Directive).<\/p><p>This SWMI public consultation process will actively inform the development of a programme of measures under the third RBMP, a draft of which will be published in December 2020.  A further 6 month public consultation process on the draft RBMP will occur in the first half of 2021, with the finalised RBMP planned to be published by the end of 2021.<\/p><p>The extent, depth and complexities of discussions on measures for inclusion in the third RBMP are significant.

These measures will take effect from September 2020. <\/p><p>In Spring 2019 the moratorium was relaxed for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allows them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.<\/p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991. <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. <\/p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.  <\/p><p>A survey of Secretaries and Caretakers undertaken in 2019 identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim. <\/p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September 2019. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action. <\/p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  <\/p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.  <\/p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on the 10<sup>th<\/sup>January 2020, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.  F&Oacute;RSA agreed to the WRC request to suspend their ongoing work-to-rule to allow the talks to progress. This suspension was effective from 21<sup>st<\/sup>January 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200075#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200075#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[17460\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200075#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a building project for a school (details supplied)","asker":"1619","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>The school to which the Deputy refers to was approved funding under the Additional Accommodation Scheme 2018 to enable it to build three classrooms, one resource room, two standard WC and one WC for assisted users.  <\/p>  <p>  A Stage 1 submission was received in the Department which indicated there were site restrictions applicable to the project which in turn will lead to increased costs for its delivery.

Regulations governing normal residence for Child Benefit purposes are contained in S.I. 142\/2007 (Article 159) and they provide inter alia for the following: <\/p> <blockquote> \t1.In the event that a qualified child is resident with both mother and father, he or she will be regarded as normally residing with the mother (or step-mother); <br \/><br \/>2.If mother and father are resident in separate households, the qualified child shall be regarded as normally residing with the person with whom he or she resides for the majority of the time.  <\/blockquote>  <p>Where the persons are resident in separate households the qualified children shall be regarded as normally residing with the person with whom they reside the majority of the time.  Where children are resident an equal amount of time with both parent, the children&rsquo;s mother is deemed to be the qualified person for the purposed of receiving Child Benefit. <\/p><p>The policy to pay to the child&rsquo;s mother was originally introduced in 1974 in the context of the Children&rsquo;s Allowance scheme and continued when Children's Allowance was replaced by Child Benefit in 1986.  In 1974, approximately 85% of Children's Allowance payments were already in payment to mothers, having been transferred on a voluntary basis by the then qualified person, i.e. the father.  <\/p><p>Having advocated this change, the policy to pay Children's Allowance\/Child Benefit to the mother was subsequently endorsed by the Commission on the Status of Women (1972 and 1974) as well as by the Child Benefit Review Committee (1995).  It was given further support in a commissioned report published in 1994 by Combat Poverty Agency and completed by the Economic and Social Research Institute.<\/p><p>Despite the increased participation of women in the workforce in recent years, Information available from the Central Statistics Office indicates that over 29,000 married women with children under 15 years of age currently classify themselves as &lsquo;home duties&rsquo; (Quarterly National Household Survey Quarter 2, 2017).  This figure rises to over 36,000 when all cohabiting women with children under age 15 are included.  <\/p><p>The above data confirms that there is still a considerable cohort of married\/cohabiting women who may not have an independent income other than Child Benefit.

These outbreaks have all occurred as restrictions were eased. That evidence combined with the data showing the increase in incidence of the transmission of the virus in Ireland and the ages of recently confirmed cases over the past few weeks led to the Government decision, based on NPHET advice, to defer the opening of pubs until at least 10 August.<\/p><p>Pubs and bars operating as restaurants which opened during Phase 3 can remain open once they are fully compliant with the public health guidance.

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.<\/p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie\/newdirections.

Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and hands should be washed hands before putting them on and taking them off. <\/p><p>On 15 June, the Government and the National Transport Authority launched a national communications campaign  which outlines best practice for the use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations in which it is difficult to maintain social distancing or where this distance cannot be guaranteed, and are communicating to the public about:<\/p><p>- who should wear face coverings<\/p><p>- in what settings, and how to wear and remove face coverings correctly.<\/p><p>Guidance on how to make and safely use face coverings is available on gov.ie\/facecoverings and the HSE website. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, on Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020. The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering. <\/p><p>Reasonable excuse includes where a person:<\/p><p>- cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress<\/p><p>- needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating<\/p><p>- removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person<\/p><p>- removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury<\/p><p>- removes the face covering to take medication.<\/p><p>The Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13 years. It is a matter for the person using the transport service to demonstrate that they have a reasonable excuse. <\/p><p>The Government has now also agreed to the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail outlets, shops and shopping centres. Retail staff will also be obliged to wear a face covering unless there is a partition between them and members of the public or where there is a distance of 2 metres between them and members of the public. Work on the development of relevant Regulations has commenced and it is likely that similar &ldquo;reasonable excuse&ldquo; provisions will apply . <\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings, masks and shields is constantly evolving. I can assure you that the public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of the NPHET has also been proactively examining all relevant evidence relating to the virus and the issue of face coverings. The EAG has requested the Health Information and Quality Authority to prepare a revised and updated evidence synthesis on face coverings and I have been informed that this paper is expected to be finalised shortly.<\/p><p>The latest public health advice on face coverings is available at the following links and is updated on a regular basis:<\/p><p> <\/p><p>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[17583\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a diagnostic assessment for a pupil (details supplied) with the school age team will be expedited","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>The recently published Programme for Government document &quot;<i>Our Shared Future<\/i>&quot; recognises the need to improve services for both children and adults with disabilities through better implementation and by working together across Government in a better way. <\/p><p>The Government commits to prioritising early diagnosis and access to services for children and ensuring that the most effective interventions are provided for each child, to guarantee the best outcomes.<\/p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Tests","counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":571,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[17589\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average turnaround time between taking a Covid-19 test and receiving results in the hospital and in the community, respectively; the average time to complete contact tracing for a confirmed case of Covid-19; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":572,"content":"<p>A robust, real-time process of testing, isolation and contact tracing is central to our public health strategy for containing and slowing the spread of COVID-19, as advocated by WHO, EC and ECDC. <\/p><p>Turnaround times have improved rapidly thanks to process improvements and automation.

The HSE has developed a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation which has standing capacity to undertake 15,000 tests per day\/100,000 tests per week.  Significant effort has also been made to ensure quick turnaround times. As of 20 July, 567,819 tests have been carried out with an 5.1% positivity rate overall. 50,860 tests have been completed in the last 7 days.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the recommendation in relation to 15,000 tests a day\/100,000 tests a week was always in relation to the level of capacity that should be available on a continuous basis in case it is needed and was never intended as an activity target that should be met on a regular basis. While we are in a positive position of not needing this full capacity at present, it is critical that we have it available to us when it is needed. The testing and contact tracing operational and resource model has been designed to flex up and down as needed to match an increase in demand, it has been stressed tested at higher activity levels and is capable of responding quickly to changes in demand.<\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 testing demand is influenced by a range of factors including prevalence of the virus, the case definition and overall testing strategy, and testing activity levels will fluctuate as these factors change as we have already seen over the last four months.<\/p>  <p>  While prevalence is low at present, Ireland is currently pursuing a very robust testing strategy under the guidance of NPHET. The case definition is very broad, with a low threshold for referral in place in line with the ECDC guidance. There are also a number of targeted testing programmes in place which are aimed at potential asymptomatic carriers and populations\/settings that are most vulnerable to the virus. This includes testing of all close contacts, weekly testing of nursing home staff and pre-testing of incoming hospital patients.<\/p>  <p>  Close contacts are now being tested twice and contacted on a daily basis to monitor symptom development. Very few countries are proactively testing asymptomatic contacts in this manner. The vast majority of close contacts tested so far were asymptomatic. Data for 19 May - 12 July shows that of contacts with first test results confirmed, the overall positivity rate was 8%. Within that group, the positivity rate for symptomatic contacts was 16%, whilst it was 6% for asymptomatic contacts.<\/p>  <p>  All staff in nursing homes are being tested weekly over the course of 4 weeks, at which point the programme will be reviewed. This programme is in recognition of the vulnerability of nursing homes to this virus and builds on the mass testing programme carried out in April\/May.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the HSE has developed guidance for the management of planned hospital admissions for non-COVID care which sets out advisory testing strategies for hospital patients, both inpatient and daycase.<\/p>  <p>  NPHET will continue to consider how best to target testing capacity. Our testing strategy will continue to evolve and will be based on emerging evidence, public health risk assessments and will continue to be directed by Public Health advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[17594\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020072200079#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that private hospitals are seeking cash contributions over and above the insurance cover of patients to cover PPE costs; and if he will consider that seeking insurers and hospitals ensure that these costs are included in cover in order that patients are not prevented from receiving the needed treatments by unexpected cost barriers.","asker":"1549","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>As Minister for Health, I do not have responsibility for private hospitals, including in relation to charges that they apply to patients.

This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan.
